PREFACE OF THE PRESIDENT 4 One of the Court's main objectives and part of its mission to promote transparency and accountability is to bring the European Court of Auditors closer to EU citizens.
It is therefore a great pleasure for me to welcome you as a reader of the first annual activity report of the European Court of Auditors.
The purpose of the report is to provide an overall overview of the Court and to give an account of its activities in 2007, the year in which it celebrates its 30th anniversary as an external auditor of the European Union, which, according to its mandate, contributes to improving EU financial management and acts as an independent guardian of the financial interests of the Union's citizens.
The Court makes its main contribution through its audits and reports, which enable the audited body to improve its financial management, and assist the discharge authority (European Parliament and Council) in its monitoring of the implementation of the EU budget.
This report provides an overview of the audit reports published in 2007 and highlights the main conclusions regarding the implementation of the 2006 EU budget and the sound financial management of EU funds.
The Court not only reports on the financial management of past years, but also actively contributes to the establishment of an EU financial control framework.
2007 was a very important year for EU financial management.
The Court's position is outlined in the section on the Court's views on significant developments in Member States' accountability and the Court's contribution to the public consultation on budgetary reform launched by the European Commission.
None of the Court's results in 2007 would be conceivable without the commitment, know-how and competence of its 850 staff.
Staff are the main capital of a future-oriented authority seeking constant improvement.
This first annual activity report provides details of the Court's reform process, which was launched in 2006 with a self-assessment.
In 2007, progress was made in implementing the resulting action plan, and at the end of the year a so-called peer review procedure was launched under the direction of a group of auditors belonging to the national audit offices of Canada, Austria, Norway and Portugal.
A first result of this reform process was the following statement on the Court's mission, mission statement, values and strategic objectives, which will guide the future activities on which the Court will report in due course.
I wish you much pleasure in reading the first Annual Activity Report and I hope it will be of benefit to you.

8 ROLE AND WORK OF THE HOF WHAT ROLE HAS THE HOF?
The European Union budget amounts to around EUR 120 billion, representing about 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of its 27 Member States.
This represents a small proportion compared to national budgets.
For some Member States, however, EU funds play an important role in the financing of public activities, for example, the overall budget volume is close to the GNI of some countries, such as Romania.
The composition of the budget has changed over time, with agricultural and cohesion policy being the main areas of expenditure (see Box 1).
The budget is established annually, on the basis of seven-year financial frameworks, by the Council, i.e. representatives of the Member States, and the directly elected European Parliament, on a proposal from the European Commission.
The Commission carries out the budget on its own responsibility, but shares a significant share of the administrative tasks with the Member States, particularly in terms of expenditure on agricultural and cohesion policy.
Depending on the expenditure regime, national authorities may be responsible for defining spending strategies, selecting beneficiaries and projects, and making payments.
A specific feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments based on applications from beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers throughout the Union.
9 BOX 1 – HOW DOES THE EU TAKE YOUR GOODS?
The EU budget is largely used for purposes other than national budgets, partly due to different areas of responsibility.
For example, the Union is not responsible for social security systems, which usually account for a large part of national expenditure.
Since the 1960s, agricultural expenditure, which generally takes the form of payments to farmers throughout the Union, has been the main component of budgetary expenditure, albeit at present with a decreasing trend.
In 2008, slightly less than half of the budget is earmarked for the conservation and management of natural resources, mainly for agriculture and rural development.
Since the 1980s, a significant part of the expenditure has been spent on cohesion – i.e. regional and social development – to co-finance a wide range of projects, from road construction in Slovakia to training courses for the unemployed in Denmark.
For 2008, expenditure on sustainable growth, of which the lion's share of cohesion, was estimated at 38% of the budget.
This heading also covers a large part of the EU's funding for research.
Some 6% of the budget is spent on the management of the Community institutions.
EU expenditure Citizenship, freedom, security and justice 1% The European Union as a global player 6% Administration 6% Cohesion – Sustainable growth 38% Agriculture – Conservation and management of natural resources 49%
Democratic societies need complete and correct publicly available information as the basis for discussion and decision-making, both with a view to improving financial management and ensuring accountability.
In its role as external auditor of the EU, the European Court of Auditors ensures that the EU funds have been correctly entered, regardless of their place of use, and spent in accordance with the legislation, taking due account of the optimal use of funds.
The Court's audit results are used by the Commission, Parliament and the Council, as well as by Member States to improve EU financial management.
In addition to the Court's work, many national control authorities are examining EU funds, provided they are managed and spent by public authorities in the Member States.

What audit results does the Court refer to?The Court applies three different types of audit to 1: audit of the accounts, compliance audit (audit of compliance with legislation) and audit of the financial statements, depending on which of the three following issues is the starting point of the audit: 11 • • • In all essential respects, does the financial statements provide an actual picture of the financial situation, results and cash flows for the year in accordance with the current accounting framework?
According to the EC Treaty, the Court is obliged to make such a statement – or opinion – on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The annual Statement of Assurance is generally known under the French acronym DAS (Déclaration d'Assurance).
1 For more information on the Court's audit methods, see the manuals available on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
The Court shall carry out its audit of the EU's annual accounts in accordance with International Audit Principles (ISAs), which are valid in both the public and private sectors.
The Court, together with the national control authorities, actively participates in the further development of international audit standards promoted by the standardisation bodies (Intosai, IFAC).
In order to ensure that payments are consistent with the legislation and frameworks, the Court draws on the results of both its analysis of the monitoring and control systems to prevent or detect errors of legality and regularity and to correct them, as well as a sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Where systems are audited and found to be reliable, the number of operations to be audited by the Court shall be reduced in order to arrive at a sound conclusion as to their legality and regularity.
In selecting the topics for its audit activities, the Court strives to identify areas where the greatest impact is to be expected in terms of the potential for improvement identified in terms of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of EU expenditure.

13 BOX 2 – THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COURT IN RESPECT OF PAYMENTS RELATING TO THE EU BUDGET The Court does not have the necessary resources to examine in detail all the operations of the EU budget.
The Court follows these processes up to the final beneficiary of the aid, such as a farmer in southern Germany.
The Court then carries out on-the-spot checks, such as the measurement of the size of the agricultural area, to determine whether the relevant information in the aid application corresponds to the actual circumstances.
Population from all agricultural payments By being a statistical sample, the results can be extrapolated to the population concerned, i.e. a specific area of revenue or expenditure, and together with information resulting from the system evaluation can serve as the basis for an overall audit opinion.
This graph shows how the Court proceeds to identify operations for the purposes of the in-depth review.
In practice, the Court's sampling procedures are more complex, e.g. a two-stage sampling procedure is used to improve the efficiency of the audit work.

14 STRUCTURE OF GUIDANCE AND ORGANISATION BUILDING THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS The Court of Auditors acts as a collegial body of 27 members, each with one member per Member State.
As the organizational chart shows (see page 17), there are four thematic audit groups covering different budgetary areas (preserving and managing natural resources – structural policies, transport, research and energy – external policies – own resources, banking activities, administrative expenditure, Community institutions and bodies and internal policies).
The fifth audit group (CEAD or coordination, communication, evaluation, quality assurance and development) is responsible for "horizontal issues such as the coordination in the field of statement of assurance, quality assurance, the development of the Court's audit methodology and the general dissemination of the Court's audit results and reports.
In addition, a Management Committee composed of members of all audit groups shall be responsible for preparing all administrative matters requiring a formal Court decision.
MEMBERS The members of the Court shall be appointed by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, for a term of six years in accordance with the proposals made by each Member State, and shall be eligible for re-election.
In addition to its role within the College, which is responsible for final decision-making on audits and opinions, as well as on broader strategic and administrative issues, each member is responsible for his or her specific tasks primarily in the audit area.
The member shall then present the report to the audit group or the Court and, after its adoption, to the European Parliament, the Council and other interested third parties.
With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007, the Court welcomed two new members, Mrs Nadeschda Sandolova and Mr Ovidiu Ispir.
One year later, on 1 January 2008, the Court added three new members, Mr Michel Cretin (France), Mr Henri Grethen (Luxembourg) and Mr Harald Noack (Germany), as the term of office of its predecessors had expired.
In addition, the Council extended the term of office of four members (Greece, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom) for a further six years.

16 THE PRESIDENT The President of the European Court of Auditors is headed by the President, who is elected by the members from among them for a term of three years, with the right of re-election.
The role of the President is that of a Primus inter Pares.
The President shall represent the Court in all its external relations, in particular in its relations with the discharge authority, with the other institutions of the European Union and with the supreme audit authorities of the Member States and beneficiary countries.
On 16 January 2008, Mr. Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, the Portuguese Member, was elected 11th President of the Court.
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL The Secretary-General shall be the highest-ranking member of the institution and shall be appointed by the Court for a period of six years and shall be eligible for re-election.
The Secretary-General shall be responsible for the management of the Court's staff, including professional training and the Translation Directorate, each with one unit per official language (22), excluding Gaelic.
The Secretary-General shall also be under the responsibility of the General Secretariat.
The term of office of the current Secretary-General of the Court, Mr Michel Hervé, was extended on 1 July 2007.
THE HOFE'S PERSONNEL The staff of the European Court of Auditors shall be around 850 staff (836 on 31 December 2007) and shall comprise auditors (484), translators (162) and administrative staff.
The Court's auditors have a wide range of training profiles and relevant professional experience in both the public and private sectors, in particular in the fields of accounting, financial management, internal and external audit and legal and economic sciences.
Like the other EU institutions, the Court employs nationals from all Member States.
18 OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT REPORTS AND 3 OPINIONS OF THE COURT The results of the Court's audits of the accounts and compliance audits are mostly incorporated in annual reports on the general budget of the EU and on the European Development Funds (EDFs), as well as in the special annual reports on the Union agencies and bodies.
The results of the audit shall be published during the year in the form of special reports.
The Court also publishes opinions on draft legislative acts affecting financial management.
ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE 2006 FINANCIAL YEAR ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET As the Court has repeatedly stated in its annual reports on the implementation of the EU general budget, adequate and appropriate internal control systems set up by the Commission and the Member States are key to ensuring proper EU budgetary management.
In recent years, the Court has recognised the Commission's efforts to promote and apply improved internal control and administrative procedures, both in terms of the reliability of the EU's annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions identified therein.
The 2006 Annual Report continued this tradition by identifying areas where – at times significant – there was a need for improvement, as well as showing large areas of expenditure where the situation is still unsatisfactory.
The Court concluded that the ‘final accounts of the European Communities, which show the implementation of the 2006 EU budget, give a true and fair view of the financial situation and results of the Communities, except for the designation of excessive amounts of accounting liabilities and pre-financing in the balance sheet.
Further improvements are therefore considered necessary to ensure that the newly introduced accrual accounting is fully functioning and that its potential as a reliable management and control tool can be fully exploited.
3 This section is intended to introduce the Court's reports and opinions, rather than its summary.
More detailed information can be found in the full text of the Court documents published on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) after their adoption.
With regard to the areas of expenditure identified in the ‘Final accounts of the European Communities', in which most payments are made – agriculture [mainly agricultural expenditure not covered by the Integrated Administration and Control System (IPCS)], structural measures, internal policies and large parts of external policies – the Court gives a negative opinion on the legality and regularity of these expenditures and concludes that these expenditures continue to be significantly affected by errors.
In the case of payments in these areas, monitoring and control systems could only partially limit the risk of errors of legality and regularity in transactions.
The Court stresses that complicated or unclear eligibility criteria or complex legislation have had a significant impact on the legality and regularity of transactions.
However, the Court noted a significant decrease in the estimated overall error rate in agricultural operations and concluded that, where properly applied, the IACS is an effective system to reduce the risk of irregular expenditure.
In addition, the Court noted that the operations underlying commitments and revenue did not show any significant error, including payments related to administrative expenditure, the bulk of the pre-accession strategy and parts of external policies (see Box 3). 19
20 BOX 3 – SUMMARY OVERVIEW OF THE LEGALITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSALS SUBMITTED BY FIELD OF EXPENDITURE The table gives a summary of the overall assessment of the monitoring and control systems as set out in the respective chapters of the 2006 Annual Report and gives a rough overview of the Court's audit findings in relation to representative samples of operations.
The systems are classified as "partly satisfactory" if some control arrangements have been found to work properly, while others are not.
As a result, overall, they may not be able to contain the errors in the underlying operations to a tolerable level.
The report draws attention to a number of shortcomings in the "functioning of monitoring and control systems".
The table merely highlights the key messages, but the details cannot be fully presented.
Readers are advised to take the full analysis from the main part of the 2006 Annual Report.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (EDF) In 2007, the Court also published an annual report on the European Development Funds (EDF).
While the Court was able to give a full audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts of the EDFs, the audit opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions on the basis of payments authorised under the responsibility of delegations in the beneficiary countries was limited in view of the substantial error rate in these transactions.
OTHER ANNUAL REPORTS In addition, a further 28 special annual reports on the European agencies and other decentralised bodies and an annual report on the audit of the efficiency of the management of the European Central Bank were published in 2007. 21
SPECIAL REPORTS PUBLISHED IN 2007 The Court published nine special reports in 2007.
The reports covered investigations into financial management issues in many different areas, ranging from VAT cooperation (No 8/2007) to capacity building in countries as far away as Angola and Vietnam (No 6/2007).
The Court's tests revealed problems of all kinds with various consequences.
The weaknesses identified by the Court in relation to the EU institutions' expenditure on buildings (No 2/2007) show that not all EU funds have been used effectively in this area.
The shortcomings identified in the report on the monitoring, inspection and sanction systems relating to the rules on the conservation of Community fisheries resources (No 7/2007) could have serious consequences not only for aquatic resources but also for the future of the fisheries industry.
Despite the different types of use of funds in the various areas of the EU budget, the Court reports highlight several common issues which can be identified as follows: 22 • • • Although the use of funds should be both swift and effective, the effort to achieve these two objectives at the same time may create a tension.
This is the subject of the report on the mid-term processes of the Structural Funds (No 1/2007) and the report on the Commission's management of the CARDS programme in the countries of the Western Balkans (No 5/2007).
Although planning does not guarantee effectiveness, it is of major importance.
Questions relating to strategic and long-term planning were raised in the reports on the building expenditure of the EU institutions (No 2/2007) and on the evaluation of the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (RTD) (No 9/2007) as well as in two reports on external assistance, one of which related to the CARDS programme (No 5/2007) and the other to the effectiveness of technical assistance in capacity-building (No 6/2007).
The Commission's evaluations are a key element of its performance management system in assessing performance and, where necessary, demonstrating the need for improvement.
If evaluations take place at an early stage of the programming cycle, this means that progress is insufficient and that there is insufficient relevant data for evaluation purposes.
On the other hand, there may be fewer opportunities to make timely changes during the current period and improvements before the start of the next one when evaluations are carried out at a later date.
The issue of the correct timing of evaluations was addressed both in the report on the mid-term processes of the Structural Funds (No 1/2007) and in the report on RTD evaluation (No 9/2007).
23 • • evaluations and audits are more difficult to carry out if the objectives of the spending programmes are unclear, and this was another topic addressed in the latter two reports.
The management and controls of EU expenditure are subject to complex regulations which must be clearly and unambiguously formulated to ensure that the funds are used for the intended purposes.
The existence of clear definitions and rules is crucial if funds are to be collected or used as planned.
This was the subject of the reports on the European Refugee Fund (No. 3/2007) and on checks on goods and substitution by Member States when exporting agricultural products (No. 4/2007).
The lack of common definitions is one of the factors which may affect the completeness, comparability and reliability of data from the different Member States.
This can have consequences if the data becomes the basis for decisions such as the allocation of funds.

OPINIONS PUBLISHED IN 2007 The Court also contributes to improving EU financial management by delivering opinions on proposals or budgetary management issues.
These opinions are required as part of the adoption procedure of financial provisions 4 or may be submitted at the request of one of the other institutions of the Community 5. In addition, the Court may submit opinions on its own initiative.
The Court's opinions may address issues relating to specific areas of expenditure, such as the two opinions of 2007 concerning new Regulations for the European Development Funds (Nos 2/2007 and 9/2007).
They may also cover broader issues of EU financial management, such as the Court's opinion on annual summaries, national declarations and the audit work of national audit bodies (No 6/2007).
Opinions are based on the Court's expertise in EU financial management over the years in the course of its audits, and in some cases reference is made to certain audits.
For example, in the opinion on ensuring the proper application of the customs and agricultural rules (No 3/2007), the Court refers to a recommendation in an earlier special report that the Commission should take measures to improve the reliability of sources of information on fraud.
The need for simplification is a recurring issue in the Court's opinions (see, for example, Opinion No 7/2007 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities).
In a 2007 opinion (No 6/2007), the Court presented its position on the annual summaries and on the so-called national declarations submitted voluntarily by some Member States on their own initiative.
This opinion is discussed in more detail in the section entitled 'The Court's position'.
Article 279 of the Treaty.
Article 248(4).
Most of the Court's opinions have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and are available on the Court's website.
26 CONTINUING AND EFFECTIVENESS Public financial control plays a key role in modern democratic societies from the point of view of efficient financial management.
The audit activities will be held accountable to the addressees at the end of the information chain, in this case to European citizens, whether their taxpayers' money is spent in a proper and appropriate manner.
From this point of view, public financial control is a central element of accountability and a useful basis for public discussion.
In this respect, the Court's work has considerable potential for impact.
The Court's audits serve as a direct source of information for decision-makers in the institutions concerned, primarily the Commission, Parliament, the Council and the Member States, in the European context.
On the basis of that information, they may take measures with or without reference to the examination conclusions.
Although the Court's audit activity has its main effect on its published reports, it has already had a certain effect throughout the course of the audit itself.
In particular, all the audits will result in the submission of detailed audit findings, which will be sent to the audited body in order to confirm the accuracy of the Court's observations.
The final report text is also subject to a 'contradictory procedure'.
The responses of the audited body, namely the Commission, will be published together with the reports.
In the replies, the audited body often acknowledges the problems identified by the Court and sets out the steps it intends to take to remedy them.
After completion of the audit work and publication of a report, the audit results shall be evaluated and used by Parliament and the Council to carry out their political task of monitoring the use of the budget.
In the framework of the annual discharge procedure, the Court's reports form a basis for the Council's recommendation on this subject and for Parliament's decision.
During the 2006 discharge procedure, particular attention was paid to the conclusions of the Court in the field of structural policies.
In its 2006 discharge resolution, Parliament directly refers to an action plan proposed by the Commission as a direct consequence of the conclusions of the Court's annual report and calls for quarterly reports on the state of its implementation.
Parliament also calls for a better understanding of the corrective measures taken to address the errors and weaknesses.
The special reports will also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
However, due to the fact that they are published during the course of the year, the presentation of the special reports and the debate on them have usually taken place at an earlier stage in the meetings of Parliament and the Council.
A good example of a possible follow-up is provided by the recent special report on building expenditure (No. 2/2007).
In fact, Parliament had already entrusted its administration with the preparation of a report examining whether it would be feasible to create a European Construction Agency, to which responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the buildings of the institutions and bodies of the European Union is delegated.
The Court's audit report on controls carried out by Member States on the export of agricultural products (No 4/2007) can be given as a further example.
The Council and the Commission responded promptly to the Court's recommendations by amending the existing legislation.
The impact of the audit reports can be increased by their thematicisation in the relevant media, which brings greater attention and stimulates public debate.
The media are the most immediate source of information for citizens.
As a rule, the Court's annual report on media coverage is quite comprehensive, but some special reports have also been followed with interest by the press.
The fisheries report (No. 7/2007) has received great attention in the media.
An extraordinary Fisheries Council was convened to discuss the Court's report and the Commission initiated a procedure which may result in amendments to the legislation to remedy the shortcomings identified.
This is an example of a report that has made a particularly valuable contribution to the decision-making process because of its relevance and timeliness.
This section provided some indication of the impact of the Court reports published in 2007.
Further details on the follow-up to previous observations of the Court are given in the respective chapters of its annual report.
The Court's most frequently commented in its last annual report is that, despite the measures taken, the shortcomings identified in the previous year have only been partially rectified.
Opinions should also be considered when considering the impact of the Court's work.
The Court's intention is to analyse increasingly the long-term impact of its work, both audits and opinions.
This can be illustrated by the example set out in Box 4.
27 BOX 4 – THE COURT'S OPINION ON ‘single audit' Over the years, the Court has published a number of opinions on how to develop the general internal control system for the EU budget.
The opinion on the "Single Audit" (No. 2/2004) in 2004 has made a significant contribution in this respect.
In this opinion, the Court proposes to integrate the definition and implementation of all internal control into a single integrated control framework, which includes common principles and objectives and ensures that costs and benefits are proportionate.
The opinion on the ‘Only audit' developed into a reference document for the Commission, but also for the Court, for example in 2007 in its comments on the definition of effective and efficient internal control in the updated implementing rules of the Financial Regulation (Opinion No 1/2007).
The integrated audit approach is reflected in the Commission's 2006 Integrated Internal Control Framework Action Plan.
The Commission has taken steps to stress the role and responsibilities of the Member States in the field of internal control, including the new obligation to submit annual summaries of audit opinions, declarations and audits carried out in accordance with the regulations applicable to each area of expenditure.
28 THE POSITION OF THE HIGH NATIONAL SUMMARY AND DECLARATIONS The Commission and Member States have launched initiatives to increase Member States' involvement in the accountability cycle for EU funds.
In part, this is intended to address the problem of the major error rates with regard to the legality and regularity of the main areas of expenditure in the budget, particularly in those areas where the Commission and the Member States share management.
Significant recent developments include the obligation for Member States to provide annual summaries of available audit results and declarations, the voluntary initiatives of some Member States to make national declarations and the decision of some national control authorities to draw up audit reports on the management of EU funds.
In its opinion No 6/2007, the Court considers that, where properly implemented, all these elements could improve the management and control of EU funds.
The opinion explains the conditions under which these elements provide additional benefits and can be used by the Court in compliance with the requirements of international auditing principles.
As annual summaries form an integral part of the internal control system, the Court will assess the extent to which they improve the functioning of internal control through its usual audit procedures.
Annual summaries can lead to better overall control of EU funds in areas of shared management, insofar as they highlight strengths and weaknesses.
National declarations are based on voluntary initiatives by certain Member States and are made at the highest level and submitted to national parliaments.
Although they alone do not form conclusive audit evidence, they can be seen as a novel element of internal control and provide valuable information on the implementation of the EU budget.
The Court recognises the potential benefits of national declarations and audit work in raising awareness among Member States of the importance of internal control of EU funds.
The audit work carried out by the national control authorities (national audit reports) in relation to the legality and regularity of EU expenditure or the national declarations could provide audit evidence for the Court if it can verify the usefulness and quality of the audit work in accordance with international audit principles.
In this case, the Court will take into account the audit reports issued by national control authorities when planning and carrying out its own audits.
National declarations and national audit reports contain statements on control systems.
National declarations may also contain certain examination judgements on the legality and regularity of the transactions.
Experience shows that the main risk to the legality and regularity of transactions lies in the reliability of the information provided by the beneficiaries when applying for EU funds, rather than in the way in which this information is processed by the Member States and the Commission.
The declaration that systems work as required by EU regulations cannot alone guarantee the legality and regularity of the transactions concerned.
Recognising the need for a stronger role for national control authorities in the overall context of accountability of EU expenditure, the EU's Contact Committee of Supreme Audit Institutions has set up a working group on the harmonisation of audit standards and standards specifically tailored to the EU context.
Joint audit approaches and methods improve the Court's ability to rely on the work of the national control authorities, provided that the quality of this work is directly demonstrated.
REVIEW OF THE EU BUDGET In September 2007, the Commission published a consultation paper to launch an open debate on EU finances as part of a far-reaching budgetary review.
The Court presented its contribution to the debate at the beginning of April 2008, which highlighted the main principles to be taken into account in designing new programmes, in order to provide European added value in terms of clarity of objectives, the pursuit of simplification, the sense of reality, transparency and accountability.
Among other things, the Court recommended that the following aspects be taken into account: • • • orientation of expenditure programmes not after input but after output; better use of the concept of acceptable risk in the design and adoption of expenditure programmes; degree of discretion to be granted to national or regional authorities in the management of expenditure programmes and accounting; whether VAT own resources are still a useful part of the own resources system, with a view to reviewing all the compensatory mechanisms based on the guiding principles of the own resources system – justice, transparency, cost-effectiveness, simplicity and contribution capacity of each Member State. 29
30 THE WORK OF THE HOF IN 2007 AND HINAUS IN 2007 The Court shall present its future audit work annually in a work programme submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and available to the public on the Court's website.
The Court monitors the implementation of the work programme as a basis for improvements in subsequent years.
In 2007, the number of adopted special annual reports on European agencies and other decentralised bodies increased significantly.
The number of special reports and opinions was similar to that of previous years.
The annual reports on the general budget and the European Development Funds have been published as planned.
Results (number) 2004 2005 2006 2007 Special reports 10 6 11 9 Annual reports (including EDFs) 1 1 1 1 Special annual reports 23 20 23 29 Opinions 2 11 8 9 In 2007, the Court first applied its new assurance model (examination of audit reliability) to achieve sufficiently robust results in the most efficient way possible.
The Court also decided to provide more detailed information on the results of its Statement of Assurance, in particular on the results of the audit of individual operations.
The Court considers that this will provide useful information for monitoring purposes, together with a schematic presentation of the results of the system evaluations, which will make progress in the area of financial management measurable.
ACTION PLAN AND PEER-REVIEW PROCEDURE The Court constantly strives to improve all aspects of its work.
In 2005, the Court decided to submit to a peer review procedure.
In doing so, senior staff of a small number of Supreme Audit Institutions evaluate the organisation or results of a sister institution on the basis of professional standards and against the background of their respective professional experience.
As all Supreme Audit Institutions have similar tasks, peer review procedures can make a very valuable contribution to improving audit bodies.
In 2006, as part of the preparation for the peer review procedure, the Court carried out a self-assessment in which the institution was given the opportunity to explore its strengths and weaknesses.
In 2007, the Court adopted an action plan to address the weaknesses identified.
The plan comprised a total of 23 measures, six of which were the subject of task forces involving members of the Court and staff from various areas and hierarchy levels of the institution: 31 1. Mission statement, mandate, strategic objectives and planning 2. Management structure (management), structure and organisation 3. Internal performance indicators 4. Employees and internal communication 5. External stakeholders and communication approaches, external communication strategy 6. Improvement of report quality The results of these task forces presented in 2007 included new declarations on mission, mission statement and values as well as strategic objectives for the Court, a new strategy and guidelines for internal communication and a report on ways to improve report quality. The peer review procedure started at the end of 2007.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF AUDIT A number of the strategic objectives adopted concern the output of the institution.
The Court strives to make the impact of its audits more visible by selecting relevant topics, timeliness and a clearer and more reader-friendly presentation of its reports.
It has also started to increase the number of its audits and improve their quality.
In 2007, considerable efforts were made to further develop the methodological basis of the Court's work as an essential prerequisite for high-quality audit work.
A new handbook for auditing accounting and compliance audits has been developed with a high workload, which will be completed in 2008.
The new Court's audit manual was adopted at the end of 2006 and was thus available for the first time in 2007 as a guide to the auditors.
In order to further improve the quality of the Court's work in the field of economic impact assessment, additional guidelines were developed and several seminars and training sessions were held.
The Court also set new ambitious targets for the use of information technologies.
In the new IT strategy adopted in 2007, the Court expressed its intention to expand its capacity to carry out IT audits and to make the use of computer-aided audit techniques (CAATs) into common practice in accounting and audit audits.
It is important that the quantity and quality of the farm output can be properly assessed.
The Court is developing performance indicators which should enable it to provide a wide range of performance data in future annual activity reports.
For the future, the Court plans to develop a methodology for assessing the cost-effectiveness of the institution. 32
33 30th anniversary of the Court In 2007, the European Court of Auditors celebrated its 30th anniversary as an external audit body of the European Union.
The celebrations began with an increased presence of the Court (seminars, information stands, etc.) in most capitals of the European Union as part of the activities of the 2007 European Day.
In addition, an exhibition entitled "30 years of Court of Auditors" was opened on 17 October 2007 and included a series of thematic display boards, a sound picture show with more than 150 photos and video excerpts and numerous documents.
The Luxembourg Central Bank issued a silver commemorative coin for this occasion.
On 18 October 2007, the European Court of Auditors organised a seminar entitled "The future of public financial control in the EU", attended by a number of high-level experts from EU circles and the institution's executives.
IMPROVING UNaudit-related ASPECTS AT THE HOF Many of the tasks provided for in the Action Plan concern communication, to which increased efforts were devoted in 2007.
Among other things, a new website was put into operation and information material on the annual report was published in a more accessible format, and the Court agreed to a new procedure for presenting its special reports to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control.
Other developments, mostly directly or partly related to the Action Plan, concerned the modernisation of the Court's accounting system and new strategy documents in the areas of staff and IT.
The Court also began to modernise its information systems in the areas of audit, translation, knowledge and communication, management information and staff.
In addition, in 2007 the Court made progress in its preparations for a second extension of its main building, which is necessary due to the recent and planned increase in staff.
AUDIT WORK TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2008 7 As in previous years, the Court will present, in addition to its annual report on the EU general budget, an annual report on the European Development Funds and special annual reports on European agencies and other bodies.
The programming of expenditure under the EU's general budget takes place in seven-year cycles, so-called financial frameworks.
2007 was the first year of the new financial framework focusing on the implementation of policies.
The Court takes this opportunity to look more closely at an earlier innovation, namely the Commission's transition to activity-related budgeting and activity-related management, as well as the breakdown of the budget into 31 policy areas with around 220 activities.
The annual report for the financial year 2007 will be broken down into categories of policy areas, largely but not entirely in line with the new headings of the financial framework.
Box 5 provides a breakdown by audit group of the selected audit tasks that are completed or close to completion and on which special reports are expected to be published in 2008 or early 2009.
34 7 Fuller and more detailed information on the future work of the Court can be found in the Court's 2008 work programme on our website (www.eca.europa.eu).

36 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION COOPERATION WITH THE EU'S NATIONAL ACCOUNTING INSTITUTIONS Pursuant to the EC Treaty, the European Court of Auditors has carried out its audit in ‘ liaison with the Member States' Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCBs), while the Treaty of Amsterdam has later added: ‘The Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies are working together in confidence while respecting their independence.' This regulation has been extended in the Treaty of Nice by the fact that in the 18th Declaration of the Final Act, the Court of Auditors has been explicitly invited to establish a Committee for contacts with the national audit bodies in which all the Presidents of the SAIs and the Court meet annually to discuss matters of common interest.
The ongoing contacts are maintained by liaison officers appointed by the individual SAIs.
Working groups have been set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2007, a delegation from the Court attended the annual meeting of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the European Union SAIs held in Helsinki on 3 and 4 December by the Finnish Court of Auditors.
The meeting focused on risk management, acceptable risk and integrated internal control system for the management of EU funds, and discussed the role of SAIs in this area.
The Court will host the next meeting of the Contact Committee on 1 and 2 December 2008.
Two liaison officers meetings were held in 2007 to prepare the Contact Committee meeting.
The first meeting was held in The Hague on 23 and 24 April and the second on 11 and 12 October in Luxembourg, chaired by the European Court of Auditors.
The two meetings discussed recent developments in EU financial management and examined the work of the Task Force "Cooperation" dealing with the Contact Committee itself, its working methods and opportunities for improvement, in this context proposals for a more efficient organisation of work.
The meeting also dealt with the activities of the various working and expert groups set up by the Contact Committee to deal with specific issues of common interest.
The Court attended meetings of the network of candidate countries and candidate countries ‘in spe' (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey).
The Presidents of the SAIs of the candidate countries and candidate countries "in spe" and of the European Court of Auditors met in Skopje (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) on 11 and 12 June 2007.
An important aspect of all efforts to improve practical cooperation in the audit of EU funds concerns the audit principles used.
Against this background, in 2006 the Contact Committee decided to set up a working group chaired by one of the Court's members, Mr Josef Bonnici, "to develop common auditing standards and comparable auditing standards based on internationally recognised audit principles and adapted to the EU context."
The first meetings of the European Court of Auditors were held in Luxembourg in 2007.
In December 2007, a progress report was submitted to the Helsinki Contact Committee and a resolution was adopted.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The Court continued its active participation and participation in the improvement of international audit principles through its membership of European and international organisations for public financial control bodies, namely Eurosai and Intosai.
Within the framework of the Eurosai, the Court is represented in the Environmental Working Group and the IT Working Group and participates in the Eurosai Training Committee.
The Court hosted a seminar on "Analysis of the SAI's most common IT problems in Luxembourg on 17 and 18 April 2007 and a seminar entitled "Economic Audit – Where do we stand?" from 4 to 6 December 2007.
Since the Court became a full member of Intosai in 2004, it has been actively involved in the Subcommittee for Guidelines for Auditing Accounting (FAS), the Subcommittee for Auditing Compliance with Legal Standards (CAS) and the Subcommittee for Economic Audits (PAS).
The Court took part in all FAS meetings held in 2007 and made active contributions to the published and treated guidelines.
The FAS appointed the ERR representative (Mr Jesús Lázaro Cuenca) as one of the FAS representatives for the project of the Steering Committee of the Committee on Technical Standards on Quality of Examination. In addition, the Court took part in the CAS meeting in January 2007 in New Delhi.
In addition, the Directorate for Translation of the Court provided resources for the linguistic revision of a document in Spanish and German.
In addition, the Court took part in the XIX Intosai Congress (Incosai) in Mexico from 5 to 10 November 2007, where two main topics were discussed: "State debt, its administration, accountability and audit," and "Evaluation systems of economic efficiency based on generally accepted key indicators – targets and performance indicators."
In 2008, the Court will continue its active participation in the working groups, seminars and meetings of Eurosai and Intosai.

38 PERSONAL PERSONAL POLICY The Court's most important capital is its staff.
They have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
In its recent modernisation of personnel policy, the Court set priorities in the areas of recruitment, training, career development and improving working conditions.
SHARE OF MEN AND WOMEN As of 31 December 2007, the proportion of men and women in active employment (officials and temporary and contract staff, but without members, seconded national experts and trainees) was almost the same.
As shown in the graph below, the proportion of women employed by the Court has increased since 2001 as a result of the Court's efforts to achieve a gender balance.
Men and women among the Court's staff 46 % 12/2001 54 % WOMEN MEN 50 % 12/2007 50 %
The following graph presents an analysis of the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2007.
Like the other European bodies, the Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities in terms of human resources management and recruitment and recognises the need to more actively promote the promotion of a greater number of women to the higher management levels of the Court.
13 of the 56 directors and departmental/referee heads (23%) are women, an increase of 3% compared to 2006.
Most of them are employed in the Translation Directorate and in the Administrative Services.
12/2006 12/2006 M 67 % F 20 % 12/2006 12/2007 M 77 % 12/2006 M 80 % 12/2007 12/2007 M 64 % F 23 % 39 F 68% M 32 % M 62% W 68% F 68 % Councillors – Secretaries (AST-level) F 33 % F 36 % REPRESENTATIONS WOMEN MEN Councillors – Secretaries (AST-level) Financial Audit/Administrative Boards (AD-level) Directors and Head of Division/Head of Division Financial Audit/Administrative Boards (AD-level) Directors and Head of Division/Department The Court's recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and staff are both civil servants and temporary staff.
In 2007, the Court hired 179 employees: 117 officials, 35 temporary staff and 27 contract staff.
This high figure reflects the progress made in 2007 in filling vacancies.
The recruitment depends on the availability of reserve lists of EPSO competitions and on the availability of sufficient candidates; the procedure is sometimes rather lengthy and results in an exceptionally high number of vacancies.
The Court is constantly seeking to reduce the time limits in the recruitment procedure.
ALTERSPROFILE – CARRIER OPPORTUNITIES The following graph shows that the farm is a "young" organ (63% of employees are under 44 years of age).
Among the 102 court staff aged 55 or over, there are 27 of the 56 directors and head of department/office; this means that in the next five to ten years there will be extensive replacements at senior management levels.

Visits are usually made by central and local authorities involved in granting, managing and disbursing EU funds, as well as by the final beneficiaries concerned.
The audit teams typically consist of two to three examiners and the length of an examination trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and distance.
In 2007, travel expenses related to audit trips amounted to EUR 0.49 million (compared to EUR 0.43 million in 2006).
This represents a significant investment to ensure adequate audit coverage of all levels and locations of EU funds management.
The graphs below give an overview of the number of audit missions carried out by the Court in 2007 in the EU Member States and outside the Union.

In 2007 the staff of the Court completed on average 12 days of professional training.
The proportion of specialised training measures increased significantly compared to 2006.
The main developments in the area of training include the introduction of training courses on the Court's audit manual and related guidelines, on the Commission's accounting rules, on the use of accrual accounting (ABAC), on SAP financial systems, and on other IT and IT audit applications.
Language courses accounted for 52% of the total number of training days in 2007.
The Court has adopted for the years 2008-2011 a master plan for further training, which provides for the development of continuing vocational training in the coming years, one of the priorities being the implementation of personal development plans for the individual employees.
The Court also examines the possibility of introducing a European Public Sector Auditor Diploma (PSAD).
Box 6 provides a portrait of the staff of a selected unit or department within the Court in order to give the reader a picture of the work carried out, the staff involved and their background and professional experience. 42
43 BOX 6 – THE FISHERIES REPORT – RESULT OF A REGIONAL TEAM PERFORMANCE The Court's 2007 report on monitoring, inspection and sanctioning systems in the fisheries sector (Special Report No 7/2007) attracted considerable attention both among policy-makers and in the media.
Articles in numerous newspapers as well as the rapid response to both the Commission and the Council demonstrated the relevance and topicality of the report.
This success was based on a team of a dozen court examiners working closely with the rapporteur member, Mr Kikis Kazamias, and his cabinet.
Mr Emmanuel Rauch, a French examiner who has been working at the Court for several years, and his Spanish colleague Mr Alejandro Ballester were the team leaders of the audit during the preparatory phase in autumn 2005.
The audit included trips to six Member States, from Denmark to Italy, both to central administrative authorities to gain insight into control systems, and to major ports to assess how systems work in practice.
Insofar as the language skills of the team members were insufficient, translators from the language service of the Court provided assistance.
The audit team is very proud to have contributed to the gradual recognition by policy-makers of the serious consequences of the way in which the Community fisheries policy is implemented.
Other audit authorities have also shown interest in the audit, as it provides suggestions and know-how, for example, for an upcoming audit on a similar subject in the Baltic Sea countries.

44 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUDGET The Court's budget accounts for around 0.1% of the EU's total budget and 1.8% of the EU's institutions and bodies' administrative appropriations.
In the last three years there has been an increase of 17%.
This increase is primarily linked to the consequences of EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007.
A further significant increase can be observed in the Court's budget for construction activities (the budget for buildings virtually doubled between 2006 and 2008), as future new staff will be accommodated in a second extension building (K3 building), the completion of which is planned for 2013.
Staff resources account for around 72% of the total budget in 2007.

SERVICE INTERNE REVISION The Internal Audit Service of the Court is intended to assist the Court in the implementation of its objectives through a systematic, methodological evaluation of risk management, internal control and administrative procedures.
In addition, the Internal Audit Service makes proposals to increase the efficiency of the Court.
In general, the aim is to assess the performance of individual services in the implementation of strategies, programmes and measures with the aim of continuous improvement.
In 2007, the Court's Internal Audit Service focused on auditing the Court's accounts (including support for the Court's external auditor's work), audit of the ex ante audit, implementation of internal control standards, the Court's recent extension (the so-called K2 building) and the Court's recruitment procedures.
The Internal Audit Committee of the Court, composed of three members of the Court and one external expert, shall monitor the work of the Internal Auditor and ensure his independence.
It shall also examine and approve the work programme and the internal auditor's reports and, if necessary, entrust them with specific audit tasks.
The Committee met eight times in 2007.
EXTERNAL AUDIT OF THE HOFES The audit opinion of the Court's external auditor for the financial year 2006 presented on 28 September 2007 states: "We believe that the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2006 and of the economic result for the financial year ending that financial year in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and its implementing rules, the generally accepted accounting principles and the internal rules of the European Court of Auditors.

PREFACE OF THE PRESIDENT The Court of Auditors, as an independent audit body of the EU, makes a unique contribution to improving EU financial management and promoting transparency and accountability by providing audit services and acting as a role model.
2008 was marked by a significant number of significant progress and important developments in EU financial management for the Court, which will be discussed in more detail in this Annual Activity Report.
A major event was the peer review of the European Court of Auditors, which led to a positive conclusion on the suitability of the Court's audit management framework and on the independence and objectivity of its work.
In its 2007 annual report, published in November 2008, the Court issued for the first time a full audit opinion on the reliability of the EU's accounts.
As in previous years, however, it found too high a percentage of errors of legality and regularity in the areas of the EU budget, which accounts for most of the expenditure.
In 2008, the Court also recognised developments at EU and national level which are likely to lead to significant improvements in EU financial management in the future.
Two examples cited in this Annual Activity Report relate to the ongoing process of reviewing the EU budget, to which the Court has made an active contribution, and to the Commission's communication on the tolerable risk of error.
In the field of international relations, the Court took the lead in organising the discussions of the European Union's Presidents' Contact Committee on the EU budget reform and the revised Lisbon strategy, as well as hosting a recent workshop on the role of the EU's ORC in the context of action to address the current financial crisis.
As its audit environment is undergoing rapid change, the Court considers that internal reforms should be adapted in order to better fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to fulfil its mandate effectively.
A significant step taken by the Court in 2008 to implement its mission and mission statement was the development of an audit strategy for the period 2009-2012.
The audit strategy is based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of the audits and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will have a significant impact on the Court's work programmes over that period, as well as on its efforts to continually improve and exploit the key challenges and opportunities identified in the peer review process in terms of exploiting potential for improvement.
Due to its competence and commitment, the Court's staff play a central role in carrying out the audit work carried out by the Court as an independent guardian of the financial interests of citizens with a view to improving financial management.
On behalf of the Court and on my own behalf, I would like to thank all the staff for their commitment and professional work last year.
Special thanks are due to our former Secretary-General, Mr Michel Hervé, who resigned at the end of 2008.
I wish you a pleasant reading of this Annual Activity Report, which provides an insight into the Court and an overview of the activities carried out in 2008.
Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira President 5

Excellence and efficiency Recognition of the value of the individual, support in the further development of special skills and reward of performance.
ROLE AND WORK OF THE HOUSE IS THE EU BUDGET The budget of the European Union amounts to around EUR 120 billion, representing about 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of its 27 Member States.
However, for some Member States, EU funding plays an important role in the financing of public activities, and the overall budget is approximately equivalent to the GNI of some Member States.
The European Union's revenue consists mainly of contributions from Member States derived from their gross national income (GNI – 65.4%) or based on VAT collected by Member States (VAT – 16.9%).
Customs duties and agricultural duties (the so-called traditional own resources – 16.5%) also make up a substantial part of revenue.
The composition of the budget has changed over time, with agricultural and cohesion policy being the main areas of expenditure (see Box 1).
BOX 1 的 HOW DOES THE EU DISCOVER YOUR COUNTRY?
The EU budget is financed by financial contributions from Member States (mainly on the basis of national GNI) as well as from customs duties and agricultural duties.
The EU budget is largely used for purposes other than the national budget, partly due to the different areas of responsibility.
For example, the Union is not responsible for social security systems, which usually account for a substantial part of national expenditure.
Since the 1960s, agricultural expenditure, which is usually made in the form of payments to farmers throughout the Union, has been the main share of budgetary expenditure, albeit at present with a decreasing trend.
In 2009, 45.3% of the budget is earmarked for the conservation and management of natural resources, mainly for agriculture and rural development.
Since the 1980s, a significant proportion of cohesion spending has been spent, i.e. regional and social development, co-financing of a wide range of projects, from road construction projects in Poland to training for the unemployed in Spain.
For 2009, expenditure on sustainable growth is planned at 39.6% of the budget, of which the lion's share is cohesion.
This budget also covers most of the EU's research funding.
Moreover, EU funds will be used to a significant extent in development aid and humanitarian aid, as well as in countries that have close relations with the Union or are candidate countries.
6.7% of the budget is spent on the management of the Community institutions.

The budget shall be established annually by the Council, i.e. by representatives of the Member States, and by the directly elected European Parliament on a proposal from the European Commission, on the basis of seven-year financial frameworks.
The Commission shall draw up the budget and shall also be responsible for its implementation.
The bulk of the budget, in particular in the area of expenditure on agricultural and cohesion policy, will be implemented in cooperation with the Member States.
A particular feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments based on applications from beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers throughout the Union. 8
Democratic societies need complete and accurate publicly available information as a basis for discussion and decision-making, both with a view to improving financial management and ensuring accountability.
The EU and its Member States have an external audit body, which has the role of independent guardian of the financial interests of citizens.
In its role as external auditor of the EU, the European Court of Auditors ensures that the EU funds have been correctly accounted for regardless of their place of use and spent in accordance with the legislation, taking due account of the optimum use of funds.
The Court's audit work will be used by Parliament, the Council and the Commission as well as by Member States to improve EU financial management.
The Court's work is an important basis for the annual discharge procedure, during which Parliament, on the basis of Council recommendations, decides whether the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility for budget implementation in the previous year.
Despite its name, the Court has no judicial powers.
In the areas of shared management, Member States shall cooperate with the Commission in the establishment of monitoring and control systems – i.e. internal control – to ensure that the funds are used properly.
Internal control thus has a European as well as a national dimension.
In addition to the Court's work, many national control authorities are examining EU funds, provided they are managed and spent by public authorities in the Member States.

(Economic Audit) HOW does the COURT REPORT ON ITS RESULTS?
The Court publishes the results of its audit work in the following types of reports: Annual reports – with the results of the audit of the accounts in the form of a statement of assurance on the implementation of the general budget2 and on the activities of the European Development Funds3.
Special annual reports – with the results of the audit of the accounts of the agencies and bodies of the Communities.
Special reports – with the results of selected cost-effectiveness or compliance audits.
10 1 For more information on the Court's audit methods, see the manuals available on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
2 Under the EC Treaty, the Court is obliged to make such a statement – or an audit opinion – on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
In this context, the underlying transactions are usually payments to final beneficiaries to the EU budget.
The annual Statement of Assurance is generally known under the French acronym DAS (Déclaration d'Assurance).
In contrast to practice in the Member States, the Court makes such a statement on the EU budget as a whole.
3 The European Development Funds (EDFs) are based on international agreements concluded between the Community and its Member States and certain African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States)
The Court shall carry out its audit of the EU's annual accounts in accordance with International Audit Principles (ISAs), which shall apply in both the public and the private sectors.
However, the existing international auditing principles do not fully cover the Court's compliance audit.
The Court, together with the national control authorities, actively participates in the further development of international audit standards promoted by the standardisation bodies (INTOSAI, IFAC)4.
In order to ensure that payments are consistent with the legislation and frameworks, the Court relies on the results of both its study of the monitoring and control systems to prevent or detect errors of legality and regularity and to correct them, as well as a sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Where systems are reviewed and found to be reliable, the number of transactions to be audited by the Court will be reduced in order to arrive at a sound conclusion as to their legality and regularity.
Other sources, such as the work of other auditors, are also used to support the Court's conclusions.
In the case of economic audits, the Court uses a wide range of audit methods to assess the management and monitoring systems and to assess performance data on the basis of the criteria derived from the legislation with regard to the principles of sound financial management.
When selecting issues for its economic audits, the Court seeks to identify areas where the greatest impact can be expected in terms of the identified potential for improvement in terms of the economy, economic efficiency and effectiveness of EU expenditure. 11 were concluded, as well as decisions taken by the Council on the association of overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
The Commission manages most of the expenditure related to the ACP countries, partly through the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (see External Relations, Development and Enlargement) and partly through delegations in the beneficiary countries.
The EDF investment facilities are managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and are not subject to the Court's audit mandate.

12 BOX 2 会 THE PRESENTATION OF THE COURT IN RESPECT OF PAYMENTS RELATING TO THE EU'S BUDGET The Court does not have the necessary resources to examine in detail all the operations financed by the EU budget.
In connection with the preparation of the DAS, he therefore uses statistical sampling methods to obtain a result representative of the population as a whole.
The sample selection shall be carried out by random selection of a representative sample of the underlying transactions from all areas of the Union budget, such as agriculture, for detailed examination.
The Court follows these procedures up to the final beneficiary of the aid, such as a farmer in France.
The Court then carries out on-the-spot checks – e.g. measuring the size of the agricultural area – in order to determine whether the relevant information in the aid application corresponds to the actual circumstances.
By means of a statistical sample, the results can be extrapolated to the relevant population, i.e. a specific area of revenue or expenditure, and, together with information resulting from the system evaluation, can serve as a basis for an overall audit opinion.
In practice, the Court compares the results of its audits of statistical samples with a certain upper limit which it considers to be acceptable, the so-called materiality threshold, in order to determine how the audit judgment is to be rejected.

BUILDING THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS AND ORGANISATION The Court of Auditors acts as a collegial body of 27 members, each with one member per Member State.
All audit reports and opinions shall be adopted by the College.
The Court is divided into five audit groups to which individual members are assigned.
The organisational chart (see page 17) shows that there are four thematic audit groups covering different budgetary areas (preserving and managing natural resources – structural measures, transport, research and energy – external policies – revenue, banking activities, administrative expenditure, Community institutions and bodies and internal policies).
The fifth audit group (CEAD or coordination, communication, evaluation, quality assurance and development) is responsible for "horizontal issues such as the coordination in the field of statement of assurance, quality assurance, the development of the Court's audit methodology and the general dissemination of the Court's audit results and reports.
In addition, a Management Committee shall be responsible for the preparation of all administrative matters requiring a formal decision by the Court.
MEMBERS The members of the Court shall be appointed by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, for a term of six years in accordance with the proposals submitted by each Member State and shall be eligible for re-election.
Members shall perform their duties in full independence for the general good of the European Union.
In addition to its role within the College, which is responsible for final decision-making on audits and opinions, as well as on further strategic and administrative issues, each member is primarily responsible for his or her specific tasks in the audit area.
The actual examination work is usually the task of the examiners in the individual examination departments and is coordinated by the relevant member with the support of his cabinet.
The member shall then present the report to the audit group or to the Court and, after its adoption, to the European Parliament, the Council and other interested third parties.
On 1 January 2008, three new members – Mr Michel Cretin (France), Mr Harald Noack (Germany) and Mr Henri Grethen (Luxembourg) – replaced their respective predecessors at the end of their term of office.
The Council also extended the mandate of four members – Mr Hubert Weber (Austria), Mr Maarten B. Engwirda (Netherlands), Mr David Bostock (United Kingdom) and Mr Ioannis Sarmas (Greece) – for a period of six years.
THE PRESIDENT The European Court of Auditors will be headed by the President, who will be elected by the members from among them for a period of three years, with re-election allowed.
The President shall represent the Court in all its external relations, in particular in its relations with the discharge authority, with the other institutions of the European Union and with the supreme audit authorities of the Member States and beneficiary countries.
On 16 January 2008, the Portuguese member, Mr. Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, was elected tenth President of the Court. 14
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL The Secretary-General shall be the highest-ranking member of the institution and shall be appointed by the Court for a period of six years and may be re-elected.
The Secretary-General shall be responsible for the staff and material management of the Court, including continuing vocational training and the Translation Directorate, each with one unit per official language (22), except Irish.
The Secretary-General is also responsible for the Court's secretariat.
The former Secretary General, Mr Michel Hervé, left the Court on 31 October 2008.
On 9 October 2008, Mr John Speed was appointed Secretary General m.d.W.d.G.b.
On 10 March 2009, the Court appointed Mr Eduardo Ruiz García as the new Secretary-General with effect from 16 March 2009. THE HOFES PERSONAL OF THE HOFES The budget for the 2008 financial year provides for 858 posts for the European Court of Auditors (as at 31 December 2008).
The Court's auditors have a wide range of training profiles and relevant professional experience in both the public and private sectors, in particular in the fields of accounting, financial management, internal and external audit and legal and economic sciences.
Like the other EU institutions, the Court employs nationals from all Member States, and is subject to the EU Staff Regulations.

OVERVIEW OF AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINIONS5 ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET The annual accounts give an actual picture of the financial situation and the results of the EU in all essential respects.
The limitations set out in last year's annual report on the reliability of the accounts for the financial year 2006 are no longer valid due to the improvements that have been made for 2007.
In some areas, such as the Union's administrative expenditure, the Court gives full audit opinions on legality and regularity.
However, the Court cannot give an unqualified opinion on most areas of expenditure.
Although most of the Court's audited payments have been made in accordance with the legislation, the Court still considers the error rate in payments to final beneficiaries, such as farmers and promoters of projects financed from EU funds, to be too high.
With the exception of cohesion measures with an error rate of at least 11%, the Court estimates the error rate in these themes to be between 2% and 5%.
In some areas of expenditure, especially those previously covered by internal and external policies, the estimated error rate has fallen, but not so much that it would change the overall picture.
The result does not mean that these infringements of legislation are due to fraud or that most transactions in these areas are illegal and/or unlawful.
THE SITUATION IN CERTAIN FIELDS In three areas – administrative and other expenditure, economic and financial affairs and revenue – the Court's audits of representative samples of operations have revealed low estimated error rates.
In the Union's largest expenditure area – agriculture and natural resources – the estimated overall error rate remains significant.
Rural development, with its often complex rules, accounts for a disproportionate proportion of this error rate.
As regards expenditure under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the value of the error rate estimated by the Court is just below the materiality threshold of 2 %.
As in previous years, cohesion measures, which account for more than one third of the budget volume, are the most flawed area.
In view of the random estimate made by the Court of the proportion of the error-related transactions, it should not have been possible to make at least 11 % of the total amount of the refunds.
5 This section is intended to introduce the Court's reports and opinions, rather than its summary.
For more information, see the full text of the Court documents published on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) after their adoption.
19 WAGES TO IMPROVE MONITORING AND CONTROL The high error rate in areas such as cohesion is partly due to the inherent risk of the high number of beneficiaries applying for EU funding under complex regulations and legislation.
The shortcomings in the design and functioning of the systems also contribute to the identified shortcomings.
Most programmes financed by EU funds contain provisions on corrective measures which provide for the recovery of funds unduly disbursed due to errors on a multiannual basis.
However, no information is available on the impact of these measures.
This means that it is not possible to establish in concrete terms whether they effectively reduce the proportion of illegal and/or illegal expenditure.
Since 2000, the Commission has been working on a reform programme to improve the management of the EU budget, which includes an action plan from 2006.
By the end of 2007, the Commission had implemented two thirds of the sub-measures contained in the Action Plan.
However, it is too early to assess the impact of these measures.
Improved high-level controls – such as the Commission's monitoring of Member States' control activities – do not compensate for inadequate controls at a lower level, such as on-the-spot checks.
However, the benefits of increased on-the-spot checks should be weighed against costs.
The Court recommends that the Union's political authorities define the appropriate level of risk of error.
In order to reduce the error rate in EU payments, the Court recommends simplifying rules and legislation, streamlining internal control measures and improving monitoring and reporting.
20 BOX 3 你 SUMMARY OF THE LEGALITY AND ORDER ACTIVITY OF THE PROPOSALS SUBMITTED BY FIELD OF EXPENDITURE This table provides a summary of the overall assessment of the monitoring and control systems as set out in the respective chapters of the 2007 Annual Report and provides a rough overview of the Court's audit results in relation to representative samples of operations.
The systems Specific assessments in the annual report for 2007 Cohesion: 42 billion euros Agriculture and natural resources: 51 billion euros External aid, development and enlargement: 6 billion euros Research, energy and transport: 4.5 billion euros Education and citizenship: 1.5 billion euros Administrative and other expenditure: 8 MilliaSrdAePnAERuDro Economy and finance: 0.5 billion euros Revenues Evaluation of monitoring and control systems The range in which the error rate (FQ) lies is "partly satisfactory" when some control arrangements have been found to work properly, while others are not.
THE 2007 AUDIT AUTHORITY TO THE EDF The annual accounts of the European Development Funds (EDFs) provide a true and fair view of the financial situation and results of the EDFs in all essential respects.
The audit opinion on the legality and regularity of EDF operations is limited in terms of payments.
SPECIAL ANNUAL REPORTS In addition, a further 28 special annual reports on European agencies and other decentralised bodies were adopted in 2008.
21 QUEST 4. INTERPRETATION OF THE AUDIT AUTHORITIES An auditor may issue the following types of audit opinions: • full audit opinion if it is shown that the accounting is reliable or that the underlying transactions, i.e. payments, are lawful and correct in all essential respects; • negative audit opinion if the error rate in the underlying transactions is material and comprehensive or the accounting is not reliable; • refusal of audit opinion if the auditor cannot obtain sufficient and adequate audit evidence to support his audit opinion and the possible effects are both material and comprehensive; • limited audit opinion if an unqualified audit opinion cannot be delivered, but the effects of disagreements or limitations of the scope of the audit are not so material or comprehensive that they require a negative audit opinion or refusal of the audit opinion.
SPECIAL REPORTS PUBLISHED IN 2008 The Court published a total of twelve special reports in 2008.
In order to improve the readability and usability of its reports, the Court decided to publish its special reports in a new format and to make them available directly on its website (www.eca. europa.eu), with only a reference to their publication in the Official Journal.
As in previous years, the reports were based on investigations into financial management issues in many different areas and ranged from the efficiency of the European Solidarity Fund (No 3/2008) to the European Union's support measures for public cereals storage (No 11/2008).
The Court's audits revealed problems of various kinds with various consequences and resulted in recommendations to improve financial management as well as to increase profitability and effectiveness.
The selection of subjects for economic assessments and their design are at the Court's discretion and are based on criteria such as risk analysis, potential for improvement and public interest.
In its 2008 Special Reports, broken down by thematic area, the Court provided answers to the following questions: conservation and management of natural resources • Did the procedure for setting national milk quotas in the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 lead to the timely establishment of operational management and control systems as a sound basis for the application of the EU rules?
(No 3/2008) • Did the Commission plan, monitor and evaluate the Intelligent Energy – Europe programme (to promote energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and the diversification of energy supply), and did the executive agency responsible for implementing the programme have a positive impact on the management of the programme? (No 7/2008) • Has ISPA (structural instrument for preparing for accession, one of the instruments to assist the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe in their preparations for accession in the period 2000-2006) been properly prepared and a uniform strategy? Have the ISPA projects been implemented as planned and contributed to the compliance of the beneficiary countries with the EU environmental directives and to the improvement of the trans-European transport network?
External policies • Has the rehabilitation needs of those affected by the tsunami and hurricane Mitch been adequately identified by the Commission and has the aid been implemented in a timely and efficient manner? (No 6/2008) • Has EU support for the new neighbouring countries directly adjacent to the EU (Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) improved their administrative capacity in the areas of border control, migration and asylum management, the fight against organised crime and justice and good governance following the 2004 and 2007 enlargements?
What were the causes of below-average performance and to what extent did the Commission have a learning process to make use of lessons learned for further support in this area? (No 9/2008) • Was EC development aid effective for health care in sub-Saharan Africa (as part of the EC's commitment to poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals)?
If the financial and human resources allocated to the health sector were in line with the EC's political commitments, has the Commission been able to speed up the implementation of this aid and how effectively has the Commission used various instruments to support the health sector?
(No 10/2008) Revenue, banking activities, Community administrative expenditure, Community institutions and bodies and internal policies • Has the system of binding tariff information to promote the uniform application of customs policy and to ensure the correct level of customs duties been effectively applied (appropriate and in line with the legislation)? (No 2/2008) • Has EU regulatory agencies been able to implement the EU's main administrative and financial reforms to move towards results-oriented management?
If the agencies had sufficiently planned their actions, had they established reliable monitoring tools for their activities and adequately reported on their activities, and had they carried out sound assessments of their results? (No 5/2008) 24

OPINIONS PUBLISHED IN 2008 The Court also contributes to improving EU financial management by delivering opinions on proposals or budgetary management issues.
These opinions are required as part of the adoption procedure of financial rules7 or may be submitted at the request of one of the other institutions of the Community8.
Furthermore, the Court may submit opinions on its own initiative.
The Court's opinions may address issues relating to certain areas of EU expenditure, such as the revision of the Financial Regulation of the European Aviation Safety Agency (No 1/2008), or issues related to EU revenue, such as the amendment of the Regulation on the system of the Communities' own resources (No 2/2008).
Opinions are based on the Court's expertise in EU financial management over the years in the course of its audits, and in some cases reference is made to certain audits or opinions.
For example, in its opinion on the new Financial Regulation of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), the Court referred to its annual report on the financial year 2006, in which it had already drawn attention to high risks concerning the legality and regularity of payments for research aid.

CONTINUING AND EFFECTIVENESS Public financial control plays a key role in promoting accountability and contributes to public debate.
The audit activities will be held accountable to the addressees at the end of the information chain, in this case to European citizens, whether their taxpayers' money is spent in a proper and appropriate manner.
The Court's audits serve as a direct source of information for decision-makers in the institutions concerned, in the European context primarily to Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States.
On the basis of that information, they may take measures with or without reference to the examination conclusions.
Although the Court's audit activity has its main effect on the published reports, it has already had some effect throughout the whole process of the audit itself.
In the replies, the audited body often acknowledges the problems identified by the Court and sets out the steps it intends to take to remedy them.
After completion of the audit work and publication of a report, the audit results will be evaluated and used by Parliament and the Council to carry out their political task of monitoring the use of the budget.
In the context of the annual discharge procedure, the Court's reports form a basis for the Council's recommendation on this matter and for Parliament's decision.
29 Examples of this can be found in the 2007 discharge procedure, in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to make efforts to simplify and further clarify the rules in order to reduce the risks of error, streamline controls and reduce costs.
This applies to areas with shared management, such as expenditure on agricultural and cohesion measures, as well as to areas with direct management, such as expenditure on research or on culture and education.
The special reports will also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
However, due to the fact that they are published throughout the year, the presentation of the special reports and the debate on them have usually taken place at an earlier stage in the meetings of Parliament and the Council.
The impact of the audit reports can be increased by their thematicity in the relevant media, which brings greater attention and stimulates public debate.
Media coverage for the Court's annual report is usually quite comprehensive, but some special reports have also been followed with interest by the press.
An example of this is the special report on cross compliance (No 8/2008), which is currently being published on the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) health check.
Given the importance of cross-compliance and its central role within the CAP and the timing of its publication, the report received a broad response from the various media: television, newspapers, specialist press, Internet publications (press, agricultural associations, MEP websites, web blogs, etc.).
The report was also discussed in detail in the European Parliament, and almost all the Court's recommendations were taken up in the draft discharge report.
Further details on the follow-up to previous observations made by the Court are given in the respective chapters of its annual report.
The Court's most frequently commented in its last annual report is that, despite the measures taken, the shortcomings observed in the previous year have only been partially corrected.
The Court intends to analyse increasingly the long-term effects of its work, such as audits and opinions.
For example, the Court uses a Commission database with follow-up to its audit recommendations as a basis for assessing the impact of its audits.
The assessment may lead to separate in-depth audits leading to further findings and recommendations.
They may be included in a subsequent special report on the area concerned or recorded in a report on the follow-up and impact of recommendations on financial management.
VIEW OF THE HOFE THE CONCEPT OF THE TOLERABLE FEDERAL RISK In the context of the development of a Community internal control framework, the Court took the view in Opinion No 2/2004 that it is for the political authorities to decide when approving EU spending regimes on the level of risk they are willing to accept.
The Court proposed that Parliament and the Council agree on an appropriate balance between the costs and benefits of controls, in other words the tolerable residual risk of expenditure errors.
The costs of controls should be proportionate to the benefits they have provided in monetary and political terms.
Since the publication of this opinion, both the European Parliament and the Council have expressed their desire in their discharge resolutions to pursue the issue and to achieve a common understanding of the tolerable level of risk.
At the end of 2008, the Commission issued a Communication entitled Towards a common understanding of the concept of tolerable risk of error.
The Court welcomed this communication and sent the Commission a response in which it identified certain limits and highlighted the main aspects to be considered in the future follow-up to this issue.
In its Communication, the Commission states that any decision on a tolerable risk of error should be based, inter alia, on the potential for further simplifications.
The Court also stresses the importance and benefits of further simplifications and the potential impact on the reduction of errors or irregularities.
The concept of "tolerable risk of error" must be clearly separated from the concept of materiality threshold as defined and applied by the Court, which is the responsibility of the external auditor10.
The Court considers that the cost-benefit analysis of spending programmes could provide information not only for discussions on the tolerable risk but also for the review of the regulatory framework and management structure of the programmes concerned.
In this context, the relevant question may not be whether there is a tolerable risk of error, but whether the risk of error is so high that the scheme or programme in question should be abolished/set up or substantially modified.
Specific attention should also be given to the concept of tolerable risk in the design of spending (and revenue) schemes or programmes.
It would be useful if, at the time of adoption, sufficient information were available on the risks involved and the costs of the controls planned to reduce these risks to an acceptable level.
In this way decisions would be taken in the knowledge of the facts and taking explicit account of the risks and costs involved.
The budgetary reform process may provide an opportunity to reflect on this issue, as suggested by the Court in its response to the Commission Communication entitled "Reforming the budget, changing Europe"11.
31 10 The concept of "essentiality" is defined in the international audit principle ISA 320 as follows: "Informatians are essential if their omission or incorrect presentation could influence the economic decisions made by financial addressees on the basis of a financial statement.
Materiality depends on the size of the item or the error resulting from the special circumstances of omission or incorrect representation.
Thus, materiality is more of a threshold or a threshold and less of a primary qualitative requirement, which must have information in order to be useful.'11 See the European Court of Auditors' reply to the Commission's communication ‘Reforming the budget, changing Europe', April 2008.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT IN 2008 AND DANACH Every year, the Court presents its future audit work in a work programme submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and made available to the public on the Court's website.

AUDIT STRATEGY The audit strategy is based on the Court's strategic objectives.
33 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Professionalism Output Target group Further development and growth Consolidated audit methods, appropriate audit strategy, further development of audit practice in the public sector, development of common audit standards and comparable audit standards for EU funds, cooperation with the EU-ORCB, effective ‘Community control framework', selection of relevant audit topics, timeliness, clarity and legibility of reports, quality of economic assessments, increased impact of reports Deeper relations with the audited bodies, in order to improve understanding of the audit process and to achieve wider acceptance of audit results.
The Court's audits and reports aim to contribute to improving EU financial management and protecting the EU's financial interests for EU citizens.
The following key aspects are taken into account when formulating the strategy that is relevant to the Court's activities: EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCY Reports Audit work Work programme In 2008, the Court developed an audit strategy for the period 2009-2012 to implement its mission and mission statement.
A summary of this document is available on the Court's website.
The Court's strategy is based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of audits and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will be decisive for the Court's work programmes over that period as well as its efforts to improve continuously.
The Court seeks to maximise the overall impact of its audits over the period in question by: • selecting and designing audits focusing on issues from risk areas and of major interest to the Court's audience; • continuing to provide sound audit conclusions and useful suggestions for improvement and monitoring whether these proposals are being implemented; • carrying out a wider range of audits and presenting new types of audit products complementing the current annual and special reports; • producing a larger number of special reports and improving their timeliness and ease of use; • developing its relations with its main addressees, including the relevant parliamentary committees, as well as with the media and the general public.
These include: • better management; • an effective and dynamic personnel policy; • rationalisation of audit tasks; • improvement of IT tools; • enhancement of expertise; • strengthening relations with audited bodies. 34
AUDIT WORK TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 200912 As in previous years, the 2009 Work Programme comprises the preparation of annual reports setting out the results of the audits of the accounts to be carried out by the Court in accordance with the EC Treaty and other EU legislation.
For 2009, the Court identified a number of audit issues related to policy developments and EU financial management issues.
In terms of developments in EU policy areas, the following topics have been selected: • growth and employment; • climate change and sustainable development; • Europe as a global partner; • better regulation.
The Court also highlights the following issues in the area of EU financial management, which it believes deserve special attention: • Completion of expenditure programmes for the period 2000-2006, in particular in the area of the Structural Funds; • Accountability and reform of the EU; • Progress in the Commission's Action Plan for an Integrated Internal Control Framework, taking into account the concept of tolerable risk; • Administrative and control measures at Member State level.
The Court's objective is to address these issues from 2009 onwards in the context of its annual reports, special reports and some new types of reports (see comments below).
The Court intends to publish a series of special reports and related novel reports drawn up on the basis of the audit tasks it has selected.
The planning and implementation of these selected audit tasks and the reporting in this respect usually cover a period of more than one year.
Therefore, most reports published in a given year are based on audit work initiated in previous years.
Box 5 contains the selected audit tasks that are completed or are pending completion and the results of which are therefore expected to be published in special reports in 2009 or early 2010.
35 12 A more complete and detailed overview of the Court's future work can be found in the Court's 2009 Work Programme, which is available on its website (www.eca.europa.eu).
Follow-up to the recommendations is an important tool for the Court to actively contribute to improving financial management.
The report will include an analysis of the extent to which our recommendations have been followed and, where appropriate, an assessment of the effectiveness of the measures taken.
It is expected to be published at approximately the same time as the annual report. — The other new type of report that the Court intends to present is a report on high risk areas in the context of EU financial management.
The report is aimed at the new Commission, which will start work towards the end of the year, and will serve as a guide.
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF ACTION PLAN AND PEER'REVIEW PROCEDURES In 2006, the Court carried out a self-assessment in which its strengths and weaknesses were identified.
An action plan to address the weaknesses was subsequently prepared.
The Action Plan included a number of measures which led the Court to adopt • define its mission, mission, strategic objectives and strategic planning; • develop internal performance indicators which are gradually introduced (see section below); • adopt an internal communication strategy which is already being implemented and has opened up new channels for improving the dissemination of information within the institution; • take various measures to improve the quality of its reports, e.g. through a new graphic design to improve readability and external assessments; • adopt a progressive strategy to improve the Court's relations with its addressees, the press and the general public.
In the course of its efforts to improve, the Court will seek in 2009 to take up the comments and recommendations of the international peer review report on the European Court of Auditors, published in December 2008, which is an important stage in the Court's ongoing reform process.
The peer review was carried out by representatives of the national control authorities of Canada, Norway, Austria and Portugal.
The peers carried out their work in 2008 and in this context also contacted the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control.The final report was presented at the end of 2008.
The purpose of the peer review procedure was to assess the design and functioning of the framework set by the Court for the audits.
The audit covered the following areas: • planning and audit procedures for audit of the accounts and audits of the accounts; • reporting on audit results; • services supporting the Court in achieving its objectives.
The peer review team concluded that the design of the audit framework laid down by the Court is in line with international auditing principles and good practice for Supreme Audit Institutions.
In addition, the peers noted that • the Court carries out its activities independently and objectively; • the Court's audit reports were based on sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as provided for in the international audit principles; • the interested parties placed high confidence in the Court's reports and generally considered them fair, objective and objective.
The Court welcomes the constructive comments and recommendations made by peers, which highlight ways of further strengthening their role as the Supreme Audit Authority and the related challenges.
This includes, inter alia, the need to: • develop a culture that focuses on a consistent approach of the Court as an audit body; • strengthen quality assurance and quality control activities with a view to coherent interpretation and application of its audit strategies and methods; • develop risk-oriented audit strategies to make the best use of resources in view of the different needs of the recipients.
The peer review report acknowledges that most of the recommendations have already been anticipated in the pre-procedure action plan.
The Court intends to include the other recommendations in its 2009-2012 audit strategy after an exchange with its staff and addressees and will endeavour to implement them during that period.
EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS INTERNATIONAL PEER REVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS 38
CENTRAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS In 2008, the Court decided to introduce a system of key performance indicators (CLI) for its audit and non-audit activities in order to measure performance in achieving the Court's strategic objectives and objectives set out in the Annual Work Programme.
ZLI will strengthen internal and external accountability and improve work efficiency and quality. ZLI will be gradually introduced in 2009 and 2010.
• To inform management of the success of the Court as an institution in implementing what it has undertaken; • To support the decision-making process by focusing the institution's attention on efficiency issues and promoting improvements; • To provide the addressees with information on relevant aspects related to the Court's performance.
They are intended to provide information on the performance of the Court as a "company" and become an integral part of the Court's management system.
The volume and quality of audit work can also be improved by considering the impact of the Court's reports and opinions on financial management.
Four key performance indicators (1 to 4) are used to measure the impact of the Court's work.
They will be developed with a view to their inclusion in the Court's annual work programme for 2010.
The Court has measured the performance in 2008 on the basis of the ZLI 5 and 6.
ZLI 5 – Number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned In 2008, the Court adopted 79% of the planned number of reports.
The annual report and most specific annual reports were adopted as planned.
Of the 20 special reports planned, only twelve were adopted.
The remaining eight special reports were still in the drafting phase as at 31 December 2008.
ZLI 6 – Number of reports adopted on time In 2008, the Court adopted 73% of its reports on time.
The annual report and all specific annual reports were adopted on time, while further efforts are needed to improve compliance with the deadlines for the adoption of the special reports.
ZLI 7, which will measure the number of key audit notifications prepared on time, will provide useful performance information and will be prepared in 2009.
A CLI (8) covers aspects relating to the Court's financial management.
Two ZLI (9 and 10) will help to improve staff satisfaction and optimise the use of continuing vocational training as an instrument for ongoing updating of the state of knowledge on the latest testing methods and techniques.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION COOPERATION WITH THE EU'S NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF ACCOUNTS Pursuant to the EC Treaty, the ERH has carried out its audit in ‘Connection with the Member States' Supreme Audit Authorities (ORCBs), while the Treaty of Amsterdam has subsequently added: ‘The Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies are working together in confidence, while respecting their independence.' This regulation has been extended in the Treaty of Nice by the fact that the Court of Auditors was explicitly invited in the 18th Declaration of the Final Act to establish a Committee for contacts with the national audit bodies in which all the Presidents of the SAIs and the Court meet each year to discuss matters of common interest.
In December 2008, the Court hosted the annual meeting of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the EU-ORKB.
The main priorities of the meeting were the reform of the EU budget and the revised Lisbon Strategy for the period 2008-2011.
The Contact Committee shall seek to strengthen cooperation among its members in order to improve external audit and accountability in the EU.
The role of the Contact Committee has developed over the years in parallel with European integration.
In addition to facilitating the exchange of information between the SAIs and the ERA, this body has made significant progress in effective cooperation between the various control authorities.
At its meeting in Helsinki in 2007, the Contact Committee recognised the need to address emerging or new issues in a timely manner and agreed to provide a permanent agenda item for dealing with such current issues.
Accordingly, at its 2008 meeting, the Contact Committee discussed the economic and financial crisis and agreed to organise a workshop on the role of the EU ORCB in the context of the crisis.
A network to promote cooperation in audits of the Lisbon Strategy and EU crisis management measures was then established.
The Court attended meetings of the network of SAIs of candidate countries and candidate countries ‘in spe' (Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro).
These meetings were held at the same time as liaison officers' meetings in May and October.
A delegation from the Court also participated in a workshop organised by the Network on 8 and 9 July in Ankara, Turkey, on the audit/evaluation of systems of internal control of public finances.
Throughout 2008, the Court actively participated in the various working groups set up by the Contact Committee.
The Working Group on Common Audit Standards, whose objective is to develop common audit standards tailored to the EU environment and comparable audit standards based on internationally recognised audit principles, met four times in 2008 under the chairmanship of the Court.
With effect from December 2008, the Court took over the (rotating) chairmanship of the Working Group on Value Added Tax, and the network of experts in the field of agriculture resumed its work under the chairmanship of a member of the Court.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The Court continued its active participation and participation in the improvement of international audit principles and procedures through its membership of European and international organisations for public financial control bodies, namely EUROSAI and INTOSAI.
A delegation from the Court attended the VII EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Krakow (Poland) from 2 to 5 June.
Among the main topics of discussion were the introduction of quality management systems related to examinations in a SAIs, the examination of social programmes in the field of training and the vocational integration of disabled people.
The President of the Court presented a contribution to the role of management in the implementation of a quality management system for auditing.
Within the framework of EUROSAI, the Court is represented in the Environmental Working Group and in the IT Working Group and participates in the EUROSAI Training Committee.
It also participates in the working group set up at the VII EUROSAI Congress to develop a guide on best practices for achieving quality in SAIs.
The Court is also a member of the EUROSAI Task Force on Disaster Aid Assessment. 42
At the EUROSAI Congress, the European Court of Auditors, together with the Supreme Audit Authority of the Slovak Republic, was appointed as an auditor for the period 2009-2011.
Since the Court became a full member of INTOSAI in 2004, it has been actively involved in the Subcommittee for Guidelines for Auditing Accounting (FAS), the Subcommittee for Examination of Compliance with Legal Standards (CAS) and the Subcommittee for Economic Audits (PAS).
The Court contributed to the subcommittee to promote best practices and quality assurance through voluntary peer reviews.
Since 2008, the Court has chaired the Working Group on the Accountability and Audit of Disaster Assistance (subsequent INTOSAI Task Force Tsunami).
The first meeting of the working group was organised by the Court as host from 30 June to 2 July 2008.
The draft work programme for the period 2008-2010 was discussed and adopted at this meeting.
The main objective is to develop guidelines for accountability and audit in this area, with the aim of reaching all parties through the relevant certification body.
In addition to its coordinating role, the Court has assumed responsibility for a number of tasks, two of them in cooperation with the Norwegian Court of Auditors.
The chair of this working group also requires the Court to be represented in the meetings of the INTOSAI Bureau. 43
Of the 857 staff (officials, temporary and contract staff, but without members, seconded national experts and trainees) who were in active employment as of 31 December 2008, 501 were employed as examiners and examination assistants, 163 as translators and 173 as administrative assistants and 20 were employed in the President's services.
They have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
For human resources, the Court set out the assessment of the level of satisfaction of the Court's staff as a key performance indicator (ZLI 9).
A satisfaction survey has been conducted to provide information on this issue and to support the decision-making process in this area.
MEN WOMEN 54 % 46 % 12.2001 12.2008 51 % 49 %
The graph below shows the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2008.
14 of the 59 directors and heads of unit (24%) are women, representing a slight increase in the proportion of women since 2007.

ALTERSPROFILE The following graph shows that the Court is a ‘young' organ (62% of its employees are under 44 years of age).
Among the 98 Court staff aged 55 or over, there are 27 of the 59 directors and head of unit, which means that there will be extensive replacements at senior management levels over the next five to ten years.
Age profile 46 33 2 65 148 148 123 101 62 3 172 20-24 25-29 30–34 35–39 40–44 45–49 50–54 55–59 60–64 >64 TERMINATION The Court's recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and staff consists of both officials and temporary staff.
In 2008, the Court hired 97 employees: 48 officials, 18 temporary staff and 31 contract staff.
The recruitment depends on whether reserve lists of EPSO competitions are available.
Due to the lack of suitable candidates, the Court was not able to recruit as many new staff in many papers as planned, so the total number of vacancies (69) was higher at the end of 2008 than at the end of 2007.
However, it should be noted that a significant number of recruitments were underway towards the end of the year and that the employees concerned are expected to start their service during the first quarter of 2009.
The Court is currently seeking to reduce the time limits for its recruitment procedures.
TRANSLATION Translation is an important administrative task that allows the Court to achieve its communication objectives and fulfil its legal obligation to publish in 22 languages.
The volume of translation increased by 17% in 2008, mainly due to the adoption of a higher number of special reports.
The vast majority of translations are done internally and in peak times when the normal capacity of translation departments is exceeded, translation orders are placed with the Translation Centre (CTOU) or with external translation agencies.
In addition, translators take part in audit trips and support the auditors before, during and after audit trips, including in the subsequent stages of drafting audit reports.
The translators shall provide constant support in the ongoing updating of the contents of the intranet and the website in English and French.
They also support INTOSAI working groups and meet other specific needs related to the Court's activities.
The Court's Translation Directorate is actively involved in the work of the Interinstitutional Translation and Interpretation Committee (CITI), is a member of international committees and participates in international conferences related to the development of electronic translation and documentation tools.
TESTS In the course of the Court's audit work, auditors must travel to Member States and other recipient countries from EU funds in order to obtain adequate audit evidence.
The visits are usually carried out by central and local authorities involved in granting, managing and disbursing EU funds, as well as by the final beneficiaries concerned.
The audit teams usually consist of two to three examiners and the length of an audit trip may be up to two weeks depending on the type of examination and the distance.
Within the EU, audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member State visited, which provide useful logistical and practical support. 47
In 2008, costs of 3.29 million euros were incurred in connection with audit trips.
This substantial investment is necessary to ensure adequate audit coverage of all levels and locations of EU funds management.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING The occupation of the examiner requires continuous training.
In 2008, the Court's employees completed on average ten days of professional training.
The number of technical training measures increased considerably compared to 2007.
In 2008, the Court increased its support for the participation of its staff in ongoing programmes to acquire or maintain professional qualifications and qualifications in the areas of external audit, internal audit and IT audit.
Language courses accounted for 48% of the total number of training days in 2008 (compared to 52% in 2007).
Without taking into account the language courses, the examiners completed seven days of professional training in 2008.
On the basis of the long-term strategic objective of "Development and Growth" and of the 2008-2011 Curriculum for Continuing Training and the continuing training pathways adopted in 2008, the Professional Training Unit has improved the content of the training activities and has developed new training courses in line with the priorities decided by the Court.
In addition, cooperation with the other institutions and interinstitutional bodies such as the European School of Administration has been successfully continued.
Box 6 presents a portrait of the staff of a selected unit or department within the Court in order to give the reader a picture of the work carried out, the staff involved and their background and work experience. 49
50 BOX 6 The Report on the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme 2003-2006 (Special Report No 7/2008) adopted by the Court in 2008 provided an insight into the functioning of an aid scheme to improve the use of energy-efficient technologies.
It covered the procedures for allocating funds for individual projects, monitoring and evaluation procedures, administrative costs and the impact of the establishment of an executive agency.
The team responsible for conducting the audit worked closely with the rapporteur, Mr David Bostock.
The Head of Division responsible for monitoring the audit was Hendrik Fehr, the team leader was Peggy Vercauteren.
The examiners involved were Oliver Müller, Peter Zsapka, Zoltán Giday and Carl-Christian Buhr, with Gerhard Ross, Thomas af Hällström and Peter Welch from the cabinet of Mr. David Bostock also playing an important role.
The audit included a survey to obtain information from a broad group of participants.
Various cost accounting techniques have been used to complete and supplement the information available to the Commission.
The audit found that the programme was managed in accordance with the Commission's usual approaches and guidelines.
However, the expenditure pattern was little targeted and the overall quality of the programme could not be assessed on the basis of monitoring and evaluation.
During the duration of the programme, relatively high administrative costs (for the Commission, the Agency and the participants) were incurred, about the same amount as the amount paid to the participants during the same period.
The creation of the Executive Agency had improved the satisfaction of the participants with the programme.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUDGET The Court's 2009 budget accounts for around 0.16% of the EU's total budget, or 2.4% of the EU's institutions and bodies' administrative appropriations.
Compared with 2008, there was an increase of 41 %, mainly due to the Court's budget for construction work, because after further staff increases, employees will be accommodated in a second extension building (K3 building), which is scheduled to be completed in 2013.
Negotiations on the financing arrangements were opened with the budgetary authority in February 2008.
As a result, the construction project, whose total cost is estimated at EUR 79 million, is financed by four consecutive annual budgets.
In October 2008, the budgetary authority approved a tranche of EUR 55 million for the 2009 budget.
Staff resources account for around 52% of the total budget in 2009.

In general, it is a question of assessing the performance of individual services in the implementation of strategies, programmes and measures with the aim of continuous improvement.
In 2008, the Court's Internal Audit Service focused on auditing the accounts (audit of accounting records), reviewing the ex-ante audit, recruitment procedures, aid and staff recruitment allowances, building maintenance, expenditure on utilities and services, implementation of the IT strategy and a review of the IT control framework.
Most of the audit recommendations issued by the internal auditor in 2008 were accepted by the audited bodies and included in corrective action plans.
The Internal Audit Committee met six times in 2008 and focused on follow-up to the Internal Auditor's recommendations.
Other topics included the Committee's own 2007 activity report and the Court's 2007 report to the discharge authority on the Office of the Internal Auditor.
The Internal Audit Committee held two meetings with the Court's independent auditor to discuss the status of the audit for the financial year 2007.
EXTERNAL AUDIT OF THE COURT In its opinion on the 2007 financial year (OJ C 318, 12.12.2008), the Court's independent auditor drew the following conclusions: ‘As regards the annual accounts, we believe that the annual accounts give a true picture of the European Court of Auditors' assets and financial position as at 31 December 2007 and of the profitability and cash flows for the year ending on that reporting date, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for implementing the Council Regulation and the European Court of Auditors' accounting rules.' As regards the use of resources and the control procedures: ‘(...) we (we) do not encounter any circumstances from which we would have to conclude that the appropriations allocated to the Court were not used for the intended purposes in all essential respects and taking account of the aforementioned criteria of assessment (a) and (b) the control procedures set up do not provide the necessary assurance that the financial operations were carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

4 PREFACE OF THE PRESIDENT 4 Welcome to reading the Annual Activity Report of the European Court of Auditors for 2009.
The aim of this report is to provide readers with an overview of the main results and progress achieved by the Court during this year and to inform them of the main developments in its audit environment and internal organisation.
2009 was an important year of renewal for the EU, marked by the election of a new European Parliament, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the launch of the process of selecting a new European Commission.
The new Treaty confirms the role and mandate of the Court and its status as an EU institution and introduces changes in the management and control of EU funds, strengthening the role of the European Parliament and underlining the responsibility of Member States for the implementation of the budget.
The Court expects these developments to provide good opportunities to improve EU financial management.
The section entitled ‘The Court's point of view' contains a summary of our opinion on the risks and challenges that the new Commission will face.
It places a high priority on improving the quality of EU expenditure.
During this year, we have made considerable progress in implementing our 2009-2012 audit strategy and on the way to achieving our objectives – increasing the impact of our work and making better use of our resources.
A decisive step was our decision to submit to the Council of the European Union a new Rules of Procedure for approval aimed at streamlining our procedures for the adoption of reports and opinions.
In addition, the number of reports prepared by the Court increased from 42 in 2008 to 57 in 2009.
I am also pleased to report that our core product, the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget, once again received a positive response from our main institutional addressees, who agreed with many of our recommendations.
During 2009, the Court continued its active cooperation with Member States' Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCs) to develop common approaches for assessing EU funds and to consider how SAIs can support governments in managing the financial and economic crisis.
The Court's achievements depend on the competence and motivation of its 880 employees.
Their satisfaction is a key factor in the success of the Court and is estimated for the first time in this report.
I would like to thank the Court's staff for their tireless and dedicated work to enable the Court to carry out its mission.

8 ROLE AND WORK OF THE HOFE 8 ASSESSMENT OF THE HOFE'S WORK IS THE EU BUDGET The European Union's budget (2010) amounts to around EUR 123 billion, representing about 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of its 27 Member States.
However, for some Member States, EU funds play an important role in the financing of public activities, and the overall budget is considerable compared to the GNI of several Member States.
The revenue of the European Union consists mainly of contributions from the Member States derived from their gross national income (GNI – 76%), from customs duties and agricultural duties (the so-called traditional own resources – 12%) and from a contribution based on VAT collected by the Member States (VAT – 11%).
BOX 1 – WHAT IS THE EU GOVERNING?
The EU budget is financed by Member States' financial contributions (mainly on the basis of national GNI), customs duties and agricultural duties, and VAT contributions.
The EU budget is largely used for purposes other than national budgetary resources, partly because of the different areas of responsibility.
Citizenship, freedom, security and justice 1, 1% Conservation and management of natural resources (mainly agriculture) 47.3% The EU's largest single area of expenditure is agriculture and rural development, mainly in the form of payments to farmers, accounting for almost half of the budget expenditure.
Cohesion measures – regional and social development – also account for a significant proportion of the funding for a wide range of projects, from road construction projects in Latvia to training for the unemployed in the Netherlands.
This sector accounts for about one third of budget expenditure.
The European Union as a global player EU expenditure Source: General budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010. Administration 6.4% 6.3 % Sustainable growth (mainly cohesion) 38.8%
The budget is established annually, on the basis of the seven-year financial framework, by the Council, i.e. by representatives of the Member States, and by the directly elected European Parliament.
The European Commission shall draw up the budget and shall also be responsible for its implementation.
The bulk of the budget, in particular in the area of expenditure on agricultural and cohesion policy, is implemented in cooperation with the Member States.
A particular feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments based on applications from beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers throughout the Union. 9
10 WHAT ROLE HAS THE HOF?
Democratic societies need proper, publicly available information as a basis for discussion and decision-making, both with a view to improving financial management and ensuring accountability.
In its role as external auditor of the EU, the European Court of Auditors ensures that the EU funds have been correctly accounted for regardless of their place of use and spent in accordance with the relevant legislation and taking due account of the need for optimal use of funds.
The Court's audit work results are used by the Commission, Parliament and the Council as well as by Member States to improve EU financial management.
In addition to the Court's work, many national control authorities are examining EU funds, provided they are managed and spent by public authorities in the Member States.

(ACCOUNT OF ACCOUNTS) 2. Are financial transactions in all essential respects in line with the relevant legal and other regulatory framework?
(COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION) 3. Is financial management sound, i.e. has the use of resources been kept to a minimum (sparability), has the results been achieved with the lowest possible use of resources (economic efficiency) and has the objectives been achieved (effectiveness)?
The Court shall publish the results of its audit work in the following types of reports: Annual reports – with the results of the audit of the accounts in the form of a statement of assurance concerning the implementation of the general budget2 and the activities of the European Development Funds3.
Specific annual reports – with the results of the audit of the accounts of the Union's agencies and decentralised bodies.
11 1 For more information on the Court's audit methods, see the manuals available on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
2 According to the TFEU, the Court is obliged to make such a statement – or an audit opinion – on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The annual Statement of Assurance is generally known under the French acronym DAS (Déclaration d'Assurance).
12 HOW DOES THE HOF PRESENT IN HIS TESTS?
The Court shall carry out its audit of the annual accounts of the EU in accordance with international auditing principles that apply in both the public and the private sectors.
However, the existing international auditing principles do not cover the Court's compliance audit.
The Court, together with the national control authorities, actively participates in the further development of international auditing standards promoted by the standard-setting organisations (INTOSAI, IFAC)4.
In order to ensure that payments are consistent with the legal and other regulatory frameworks, the Court relies on the results of both its investigation of monitoring and control systems to prevent or detect and correct errors of legality and regularity, as well as a sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Other sources, such as the statements by the management of the audited bodies in the form of the annual activity reports of the Commission's Directors-General and the work of other auditors, are also used to support the Court's conclusions.
In the case of economic audits, the Court uses a wide range of audit methods to assess the management and monitoring systems and to assess performance data on the basis of the criteria derived from the legislation and with a view to the principles of sound financial management.
When selecting issues for its economic audits, the Court is seeking to identify areas where the greatest impact is to be expected in terms of the potential for improvement identified in terms of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of EU expenditure.
3 The European Development Funds (EDFs) are based on international agreements concluded between the Community and its Member States and certain African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) as well as on Council decisions on the association of overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
The Commission manages most of the expenditure related to the ACP countries, partly through the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (see External Relations, Development and Enlargement) and partly through delegations in the beneficiary countries.
4 INTOSAI (International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions) – International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions; IFAC (International Federation of Accountants) – International Auditing Association.
BOX 2 – EXAMINATION OF A SAMPLE OF PAYMENTS FROM THE EU BUDGET BY THE HOF 13 The Court does not have the necessary resources to examine in detail all transactions relating to the EU budget.
It therefore uses statistical sampling techniques to provide a representative result for the populations concerned.
The Court monitors these operations until the final beneficiary of the grant, for example a promoter in Italy.
The Court then checks – often on the spot – whether the application is in line with the actual circumstances.
By being a representative sample, the results may be extrapolated to the relevant population, i.e. a specific revenue or expenditure area, and may serve as the basis for an overall audit opinion, together with information resulting from the assessment of management and control systems and other sources.
SELECTION OF A SAMPLE OF PROPOSALS Random selection of a representative sample Population of Cohesion payments Payment to a promoter in Italy
14 TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES5 14 RESPONSIBILITY AND ORGANISATION The Court of Auditors acts as a collegial body of 27 members, each with one member per Member State, appointed by the Council after consulting the European Parliament for a term of six years.
Members shall elect a President from among their number for three years, with the possibility of re-election.
Five audit groups to which individual members of the Court are assigned prepare the reports and opinions for adoption by the Court.
The organizational chart shows that there are four thematic audit groups covering different budgetary areas, as well as another audit group dealing with "horizontal" issues.
In addition, a Management Committee composed of members of the Court is responsible for preparing the Court's administrative decisions.
At the end of 2009, the Court submitted to the Council a proposal to amend its Rules of Procedure in order to allow certain categories of Court opinions and reports to be adopted instead of the entire College of Chambers.
These changes will streamline and make the Court's decision-making more efficient, including by reducing the time needed to adopt decisions.
Each Chamber has two areas of competence: the first is the adoption of special reports, special annual reports and opinions; the second is the preparation of draft comments for the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds; and draft opinions for adoption by the College.
As with the Court, decisions are taken by a majority of the members of the Board.
Members may attend meetings of all chambers, but may vote only in the chamber to which they have been assigned by the Court.
Of course, the whole College will continue to meet to discuss and adopt those documents for which the Court alone is responsible, such as the annual reports on the EU's general budget and the European Development Funds.
The role of the Management Committee will be strengthened.
The Committee shall be composed of the President of the Court of the Presidency and the Doyens of the Chambers.
Administrative matters requiring a Court decision, as well as decisions on procedural, principle or strategic issues, shall be prepared by the Committee before being submitted to the Court for adoption.
The Member shall then present the report to the audit group and to the Court and, after adoption of the report, shall also present it to the European Parliament, to the Council and to other interested third parties.
5 Further details are available on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
THE HOFE'S PERSONNEL The budget for the financial year 2009 provides for 880 posts for the European Court of Auditors (as at 31 December 2009).
The Court's staff in the audit area shall be responsible for the planning and carrying out of audits and the preparation of the resulting draft reports.
The auditors work in teams of different sizes: for some specific audits, a team includes four or five auditors, while some of the Court's broader audits (e.g. accounting audits/compliance audits in the field of agricultural and cohesion expenditures with a view to drawing up the annual statement of assurance) involve 20 or more auditors.
As a rule, examiners must obtain audit evidence by means of various procedures: file audits in Luxembourg, visits to the European Commission and "on-the-spot" audit visits in the Member States, where the revenue received from the EU budget is generated and the actions financed from the EU budget are carried out.
The Court's reports and opinions must be accessible to readers throughout the Union, and the Court must also maintain contacts with authorities and other bodies throughout the Union in the course of its audit work.
This would not be possible without the Court's translators translating his (in almost all cases in English or French) reports and opinions into 22 of the official languages of the Union.
They shall also translate correspondence between the Court and other bodies as required and, in some cases, assist the auditors in carrying out verification visits in the Member States.
The Court's administrative staff are responsible for a large number of support tasks carried out in a multinational body operating in the EU context.
This concerns the areas of finance, accounting, budget, buildings, information technologies, transport, security, etc. The Secretary-General is the highest-ranking employee of the Court and is responsible for staff management and the management of the Court. 15

6 This section is intended to introduce the Court's reports and opinions, rather than its summary.
For more information, see the full text of the documents adopted by the Court, which is published on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET: SIX KERNAUSSAGEN • The European Union's annual accounts give a true picture of the financial situation and results. • As regards the legality and regularity of transactions, the overall results for 2008 reflect the improvements in budgetary management made in recent years. • The overall progress achieved in 2008 is mainly due to the better results in the main theme, "Agriculture and natural resources".
In the field of rural development, the estimated error rate is lower than in previous years, but still essential.
For the first time, the Court does not give a negative opinion on the subject of 'Agriculture and natural resources' as a whole. • The second issue, 'Cohesion', which accounts for nearly a third of the budget, remains problematic as the most flawed budgetary area.
According to the Court's estimate, at least 11 % of the total amount of the reimbursement should not have been paid. • The recommendations made by the Court in the past to improve monitoring and control systems remain valid.
They must be considered as part of an ongoing process in which the relevant measures can only be considered effective after some time. • In addition, particular attention should be paid to those areas of expenditure in which the Court continues to complain of a high error rate.
In many cases, errors are a result of overly complex regulations and regulations.
Simplification therefore remains a priority objective. 19
20 Unrestricted audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts The Court concluded that the annual accounts of the European Communities for 2008 give a true and fair view of the financial situation of the European Communities and of the results of its operations and cash flows in all essential respects.
Unrestricted audit opinions In 2008, the Court issued full audit opinions on ‘revenues', commitments in all themes and payments in the ‘education and citizenship' and ‘administrative and other expenditure' themes.
Limited audit opinions Payments in the theme 'Agriculture and natural resources', with the exception of rural development, were lawful and proper in all essential respects.
Payments in the theme 'Economy and finance', with the exception of expenditure for the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6) falling within this theme, were legal and correct in all essential respects.
Negative audit opinions The Court gave negative audit opinions on "Cohesion", "Research, energy and transport", as well as "External assistance, development and enlargement".
Payments in these themes were largely, albeit with varying degrees of error.
The need for improvement of monitoring and control systems Monitoring and control systems in the areas of research, energy and transport, external assistance, development and enlargement, education and citizenship, were effective in preventing or detecting and correcting the reimbursement of excessive or non-refundable costs.
In the case of the ‘Agriculture and natural resources' theme, the Court also concluded that the monitoring and control systems were partially effective.
However, he pointed out that the Integrated Management and Control System (IACS) in general continues to be an effective control system.
However, improvements are needed in some areas, in particular rural development, where shortcomings exist.
In the case of the theme 'Economy and finance', monitoring and control systems were found to be effective in two of the three areas examined.
In the third area, "Companies", the systems were considered to be only partially effective, mainly due to shortcomings in FP6.
In the case of the ‘Cohesion' theme, the Court found that, in most cases, the Member State systems devoted to the correction of errors detected in national controls were at least partially effective.
The Commission, Member States and other beneficiary countries need to continue their efforts to implement the necessary improvements in these themes in order to adequately manage the risk of irregular expenditure.
BOX 3 – INTERPRETATION OF AUDIT CASES 21 An auditor may issue the following types of audit opinions: • full audit opinion if it is proven that the accounting is reliable or that the underlying transactions, i.e. payments, are lawful and correct in all essential respects; • negative audit opinion if the error rate in the underlying transactions is material and comprehensive or the accounting is not reliable; • refusal of the audit opinion if the auditor cannot obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support his audit opinion and the possible effects are both material and comprehensive; limited audit opinion if no full audit opinion can be delivered, but the impact of disagreements or limitations on the scope of the audit are not so substantial or comprehensive that they require a negative audit opinion or refusal of the audit opinion.
22 BOX 4 – SUMMARY OVERVIEW OF LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ORDER ACTIVITY OF THE PROPOSALS SUBMITTED BY FIELD OF EXPENDITURE The following table summarises the overall assessment of the monitoring and control systems as set out in the respective chapters of the 2008 Annual Report and gives a rough overview of the results of the Court's audits of representative samples of operations.
The table provides the key messages, but not all relevant details (in particular the shortcomings of the monitoring and control systems and the types of errors), which are given in the main part of the report.
SYSTEM ASSESSMENT SPANNE OF THE FISHER QUOTE Revenues Agriculture and natural resources: EUR 55 billion Cohesion: EUR 36.6 billion Research, energy and transport: EUR 7.5 billion External aid, development and enlargement: EUR 6.2 billion Education and citizenship: EUR 1.7 billion Economy and finance: EUR 0.6 billion Administrative and other expenditure: EUR 8.5 billion Evaluation of monitoring and control systems Ineffective Conditionally effective Effective Margin in which the estimated FQ > 5 % 2 % ≤ FQ ≤ 5 % FQ < 2 % (below the error rate (FQ) is materiality threshold)
THE 2008 AUDIT AUTHORITY TO THE EDF The Court concluded that the 2008 EDF financial statements give a true and fair view of the EDF's financial position in all essential respects.
With regard to the legality and regularity of operations, the Court gave a full opinion on EDF revenue and commitments.
The Court also concluded that EDF payments were substantially affected by errors.
The Court assessed the monitoring and control systems for the EDFs as conditionally effective.
SPECIFIC ANNUAL REPORTS A further 37 special annual reports on the agencies and other decentralised bodies of the European Union for the financial year 2008 were also adopted in 2009.
The Union agencies shall perform a wide range of tasks at different locations within the Union.
Each agency has a specific mission and manages its own budget.
The audits of the Union agencies and other decentralised bodies shall be the subject of specific annual reports, which shall be published separately.
With the exception of the European Police College, the Court gave full audit opinions to all agencies on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 23
24 SPECIAL REPORTS7 The selection of topics for economic and compliance audits and their design is based on criteria such as risk in terms of the profitability of certain revenues and expenditures or their compliance with legislation, expenditure volume, timing of the last audit, upcoming developments in the regulatory or operational framework, and political and public interest.
Since cost-effectiveness and compliance audits are complex and require a lot of detailed work, their full implementation from the preliminary study to the final reporting usually takes more than a year.
The Court adopted a total of 18 special reports in 2009.
The special reports are available directly on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) and a reference to their publication appears in the Official Journal.
As in previous years, the reports related to investigations into financial management issues in many different areas and ranged, for example, from EU food aid for the needy (No 6/2009) to cash management at the Commission (No 5/2009).
In addition to the 18 special reports, the Court analysed the use of EU funds in 2009 with a view to turning the Chernobyl site into an environmentally safe state.
Recommendations on how to improve the management of EU funds made available through the EBRD were sent to the President of the Commission in a (unpublished) letter from the President of the Court.
The special reports adopted by the Court in 2009 are listed below by thematic area.
A brief report on each subject will be presented to illustrate the nature of the issues addressed and the conclusions drawn.
7 special reports are available on the Court's website or can be obtained with an electronic order form from the EU Bookshop.
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH • No 3/2009 "Efficiency of expenditure under structural measures for waste water treatment during the 1994-1999 and 2000-2006 programming periods" • No 7/2009 "Management of the development and validation phase of the Galileo programme" • No 8/2009 "Excellence networks and integrated projects in Community research policy: have the objectives been achieved?" • No 13/2009 "Has the transfer of implementation tasks to executive agencies proved to be an appropriate instrument?" • No 17/2009 "Vocational training measures for women co-financed by the European Social Fund" 25 "Managing the development and validation phase of the Galileo programme" The Court examined the development and validation phase of the Galileo programme, which was launched with the aim of creating a European Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS), and explained the causes of the misdevelopments identified.
It concluded that the development and validation phase was inadequately managed.
If the reorientation of the EGNOS (European geostationary navigation complement service) and Galileo programmes carried out in mid-2007 is to be successful, the Commission must significantly improve its programme management.
The report contains a number of recommendations designed to facilitate this task for the Commission.
Finally, in the event that the EU decides to engage in other major infrastructure programmes, the Commission must ensure that appropriate administrative instruments are available to it.
CURRENCY AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES • No 6/2009 "European Union food aid for the most deprived: assessment of objectives, resources and methods employed" • No 10/2009 "Information and promotion measures for agricultural products" • No 11/2009 "Sustainability of LIFE-Nature projects and their management by the Commission" • No 14/2009 "Have the market management instruments for the market in milk and milk products achieved their main objectives?"
26 Have the market management instruments for the market in milk and milk products achieved their main objectives?
The Court took stock of the functioning of the market in milk and milk products since the introduction of milk quotas in 1984 and examined the Commission's approach to managing the gradual deregulation of the milk sector, which began in 2003.
The situation at the end of 2008 forms the basis for the Court's recommendations to the Commission: preventing new overproduction, monitoring the price formation process in the food chain, deepening reflection on the future of producers in less-favoured areas and on the impact of the geographical concentration of milk production on the environment, continuing the focus of milk production on meeting the needs of the European internal market and on milk products with high added value, which are exportable without budget support to the world market.
EU CITIZENSHIP, FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE • No 2/2009 ‘The European Union Public Health Programme (2003-2007): an effective way to improve health?' The European Union Public Health Programme (2003-2007): an effective way to improve health?
The Court analysed the European Union Public Health Programme (PHP) for the period 2003-2007.
The Court's audit was intended to assess whether the framework conditions for projects financed by the EU budget were defined in such a way as to effectively complement Member States' action to protect and improve public health.
The report shall contain detailed conclusions and recommendations on the design, implementation and management of the programme.
Based on its findings, the Court calls into question the benefits of certain programme components of European public health programmes such as PHP.
The Commission and the Member States are invited to reconsider the EU's public health funding approach.
THE EU AS GLOBALER PARTNER • No 1/2009 ‘Banking activities in the Mediterranean under the MEDA programme and the previous protocols' • No 4/2009 ‘The Commission's management of non-state actors' involvement in Community development cooperation' • No 12/2009 ‘The effectiveness of Commission projects in the field of justice and home affairs for the Western Balkans' • No 15/2009 ‘The EU's assistance provided through United Nations organisations: decision-making and control' • No 16/2009 ‘The European Commission's management of pre-accession assistance for Turkey' • No 18/2009 ‘The effectiveness of EDF assistance for regional economic integration in East Africa and West Africa' 27 The European Commission's management of pre-accession assistance for Turkey The Court examined the management of pre-accession assistance for Turkey by the European Commission.
In particular, the first period of implementation of pre-accession assistance (2002-2006) was characterised by many weaknesses that had already occurred in previous pre-accession programmes.
The objectives set by the Commission with regard to grants were not sufficiently concrete to enable an assessment of the impact of the project and the Commission did not have the necessary information to demonstrate the effectiveness of pre-accession assistance.
Nevertheless, the projects examined have yielded the planned outputs and the project results are likely to be sustainable.
The Commission has already made some significant improvements, but the Court makes recommendations for further corrective action.
Areas where improvements are most necessary include the definition of strategic objectives for financial assistance, the setting of more realistic deadlines for achievement of objectives, and the monitoring of actual project performance and results on the basis of clear objectives and appropriate indicators.
28 MANAGEMENT • No 5/2009 ‘Commission's Cash Administration' • No 9/2009 ‘Economy and effectiveness of the staff selection activities of the European Personnel Selection Office' Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the staff selection activities of the European Personnel Selection Office' The Court focused on how the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) managed the sharp increase in the number of competitions resulting from the enlargement of the European Union and whether it provided timely aptitude lists containing the required number of successful candidates and were geographically balanced.
It concluded that EPSO had successfully managed the increase in the number of competitions resulting from the enlargement of the European Union.
However, the following weaknesses had to be addressed: the staff needs of the institutions were not notified to the EPSO in time, the selection process took too long, the selection procedures produced on average only two-thirds of the planned number of successful candidates (which were included in the aptitude list) and the management information was not consistently reliable or complete.
OPINIONS The Court's further contribution to improving EU financial management is to deliver opinions on proposals or budgetary management issues.
These opinions are required as part of the procedure for the adoption of financial rules8 or may be submitted at the request of one of the other institutions of the Union9.
In 2009, the Court adopted an opinion on the proposal to amend the Regulation of the Budget Committee of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market on the Office's financial rules (the Financial Regulation).

29 CONTINUING AND EFFECTIVENESS The Court's audits serve as a direct source of information for decision-makers in the institutions concerned, primarily the Commission, Parliament, the Council and the Member States, in the European context.
On the basis of this information, they may take measures with or without reference to the Court's audit conclusions.
Although the Court's audit activities have their main impact on the reports and opinions published, they have already had some effect throughout the course of the audits.
The replies of the audited body, namely the Commission, will sum up 29 Examples of the impact of the Court's work can be found in the measures taken by the Commission in response to the 2007 discharge resolution (and its impact mainly in 2009): in the area of agricultural expenditure The management and control system for expenditure under the newly created European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) has been aligned with the EAGF guarantee system, so that the largely recognised benefits of this system will also apply to EAFRD expenditure (see point 5.54 of the 2004 annual report and point 5.57 of the 2007 annual report).
In the area of cohesion The Commission is continuing to work on a revision of the rules applicable for 2007-2013 in order to simplify the system for reporting irregularities, and committed to prepare a report in early 2010 on the measures implemented in 2009 and the initial impact of all the measures in its Action Plan to strengthen the Commission's supervisory role in the management of structural measures (see points 1.53 and 6.36(a) of the 2007 Annual Report).
In the field of external policies In order to strengthen controls at the level of implementing organisations, the Commission is planning to develop a specific instrument to better assist these organisations in the management of EU funds and compliance with EU rules (see point 8.33(a) of the 2007 Annual Report).
In the field of internal policies, including research The Commission has developed a multi-annual control strategy for the Sixth Framework Programme based on detection and correction of errors that could not be detected by file checks prior to payment.
In order to simplify the procedures of the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission introduced a Participant Guarantee Fund, which significantly reduced the number of ex ante financial controls and the safeguards to be provided (see points 7.43(b), 10.34 and 2.42(a) of the 2007 annual report).
Source: Commission report to the European Parliament on the follow-up to the 2007 discharge decisions.
The special reports will also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
Given the fact that they will be published throughout the year, the presentation of the special reports and the debate on them have usually taken place at an earlier stage in the meetings of Parliament and the Council.
The impact of the audit reports can be enhanced by their thematicisation in the relevant media, which will attract greater attention and stimulate public debate.
As a rule, media coverage of the Court's annual report is quite comprehensive.
This was also the case in 2009, with media focus primarily on improvements in agricultural spending.
Several special reports were also followed with interest by the press.
For example, the special report on the milk market (No 14/2009) assessing the extent to which the management instruments for the market in milk and milk products have achieved their main objectives was the subject of intensive discussions in the Council and Parliament. It also triggered a broad response in the media and in the professions concerned at a time when the sector is facing a variety of problems.
The Court is working to further analyse the impact of its activity.
In 2009, it started to develop a systematic follow-up procedure for its special reports to identify and document the progress made by the audited bodies in addressing identified weaknesses and implementing the recommendations made.
This procedure will provide the Court, as well as Parliament and other interested parties, with additional feedback on the impact of its activities.
31 POSITION OF THE COURT OPINION No 1/2010 – IMPROVEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: RISKS AND CHALLENGES In February 2010, the Court first issued an opinion on measures to reduce the level of irregular payments at EU budget level and to improve the quality of expenditure (sparability, efficiency and effectiveness).
The Court concluded that, in order to strengthen recent progress in reducing the level of irregular payments, legislation in high-risk areas should be simplified and more cost-effective control systems established.
Such reforms should be undertaken in the context of the ongoing broader review of EU spending regimes.
The Court considers that the improvement of the quality of expenditure is of high priority, which can be achieved by applying the concept of European added value in the definition of expenditure priorities and by addressing the specific problems identified by the Court in the selection, design and implementation of expenditure programmes and grant schemes.
OBJECTIVES ON THE FIELDS CONCERNED IN THE STRENGTH OF SPECIFIC PAYMENTS Although the level of irregular payments from the EU budget as a whole has fallen, it remains high in the areas of cohesion and external aid, development and enlargement, as well as in the framework programme for research and technological development and rural development.
Most irregularities are due to the notification of ineligible expenditure by beneficiaries, the notification of excessive eligible expenditure and the non-compliance with payment conditions, for example in the area of public procurement rules.
They are primarily due to the complexity of the rules and payment terms and to shortcomings in the systems for controlling risks at the level of the final beneficiaries.
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SIMPLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENT OF MONITORING AND CONTROL The Commission should remove the specific system deficiencies identified by the Court in the high-risk areas and improve its oversight.
However, with an increasing number of controls and correspondingly decreasing error rates, the point at which control costs are no longer proportionate to the benefits achieved is at some point reached.
Simplification should therefore remain a priority objective.
Clearly interpretable and easy-to-use rules and legislation can reduce not only the risk of errors but also control costs. 31
32 IMPROVING THE CONCEPT OF EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES In addition to simplification, the Commission should ensure that clear objectives are set in the revision of existing and new measures.
Often more sense of reality, greater transparency and accountability are needed.
To this end, the Commission could further strengthen existing procedures for developing future strategies, in particular ex ante evaluation and impact assessment.
The Court proposes to clarify the concept of European added value in an appropriate political declaration or in EU legislation in order to provide guidance to EU policy-makers in defining expenditure priorities.
The Court considers that the Commission should complete the budget review as soon as possible and take account of the results obtained in the preparation of the financial framework starting in 2014.
Improving the quality of expenditure should be a high priority for the institutions of the European Union and thus constitute the main objective of the new Commission.
33 WORKING PLAN FOR 201010 The Court shall present its future audit work annually in a work programme submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and available to the public on the Court's website.
The work programme shall provide interested parties with information on new and ongoing audits and on planned reports.
The Court developed an audit strategy for the period 2009-2012 based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of the audits and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will have a significant impact on the Court's 2010 work programme and on its efforts to achieve continuous improvement.
The Court aims to maximise the overall impact of its audits over the period in question by: • selecting and designing audits that focus on issues from risk areas and are of utmost interest to the Court's audience; • continuing to provide sound audit conclusions and useful suggestions for improvements and monitoring whether these proposals are being implemented; • carrying out a wider range of audits and presenting new types of audit products that complement the current annual and special reports; • producing a larger number of special reports and improving their timeliness and ease of use; • developing its relations with its main addressees, including the relevant parliamentary committees, as well as with the media and the general public.
This includes: • better management; • an effective and dynamic staff policy; • rationalisation of audit tasks; • improvement of IT tools; • strengthening of expertise; • strengthening relations with audited bodies.
33 10 A more complete and detailed overview of the Court's future work can be found in the Court's 2010 work programme, which is available on its website (www.eca.europa.eu).
34 The Court has selected certain audit priorities for the 2010 work programme, including: • multi-annual character of a large proportion of Community expenditure, including flat-rate corrections and recoveries; • innovation and internal market; • human capital; • sustainable energy; • Commission strategy to simplify the legal framework for businesses and citizens.
FOURTH PRINCIPLE FOR A NEW BUILDING On 1 July 2009, the foundation stone for a new building, the second enlargement of the European Court of Auditors, was laid in Luxembourg.
Vítor Caldeira, President of the European Court of Auditors, Claude Wiseler, Minister of Buildings in Luxembourg, Patrick Gillen, President of the Fonds d'urbanisation et d'aménagement du Kirchberg, and Eduardo Ruiz García, General Secretary of the Court, signalled the start of the construction work with the symbolic groundbreaking ceremony.
This extension of the European Court of Auditors' two-building complex will make it possible to accommodate the staff employed in the course of successive Union enlargements.
The Court will endeavour to expand its range of audit-related reporting types in 2009-2012.
To this end, it will coordinate with its main external users to ensure that it has a clear understanding of their different needs and of how best to meet their expectations in the context of the fulfilment of its mandate under the Treaty.
A significant proportion of the resources available to the Court will be used to audit the accounts with a view to drawing up a statement of assurance (the so-called "DAS").
This will require the examination and audit of the accounts and operations of the general budget of the EU for each financial year.
The European Development Funds and each of the 40 European agencies and bodies shall be subject to separate declarations of assurance.
The audit work covers the period from June of year n to June of year n+1, so that the annual reports can be published in accordance with the Financial Regulation in November of year n+1.
The Statement of Assurance for the financial year 2009 will therefore be drawn up and published in 2010 and the Statement of Assurance for the financial year 2010 will start at the same time11.
The Court's work aims at presenting clear conclusions on the level of accounting and budgetary management in the various areas of the general budget and at providing appropriate and cost-effective recommendations where improvements are possible.
The Court's annual report on the general budget for 2009 will continue to be in line with the structure established in 2007 and taking into account the reclassification of the budget12.
The findings are presented under chapters relating to coherent groups of policy areas (thematics), which largely, but not entirely, correspond to the headings of the new financial framework.
Furthermore, the Court will be particularly concerned to present its findings and conclusions even more clearly and coherently in order to make them more comprehensible and readable and to simplify the comparison within and between the themes and between them and between the financial years.
35 11 Further information on the DAS approach is available on the Court's website at www.eca.europa.eu.
12 The Court has set up a DAS think tank to consider various aspects of the DAS test approach. In this context, consideration is also given to redefining the areas of specific assessments.
36 36 MEASUREMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF CENTRAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS In 2008, the Court decided to establish a system of key performance indicators (CLI) for its audit and non-audit activities in order to measure performance in achieving the Court's strategic objectives and objectives set out in the annual work programmes.
ZLI serves to strengthen internal and external accountability and to increase work efficiency and quality. WOZU CENTRAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS? • To inform management of how successful the Court as an institution implements what it has undertaken; • To support the decision-making process by focusing the institution's attention on efficiency issues and promoting improvements; • To provide information to the audience on relevant aspects related to the Court's performance.
The CSOs are primarily concerned with the achievement of the Court's strategic objectives, since they cover quality of audit, output, impact and economic management of the Court's resources.
They provide information on the Court's performance as a "company" and are an integral part of the Court's management system.
THE CENTRAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OF THE COURT 37 ZLI 1 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the main addressees of the Court's reports ZLI 2 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audited body ZLI 3 Assessment of the content and presentation of the Court's reports by a panel of external experts ZLI 4 Percentage of audit recommendations accepted by the audited body b) Implemented by the audited body within a certain number of years ZLI 5 Number of reports accepted compared to the number of planned reports ZLI 6 Number of reports accepted on time ZLI 7 Percentage of audit reports issued on time ZLI 8 External assessment of the Court's financial management: a) Audit opinion of the independent auditor b) Decision of the discharge authority ZLI 9 Degree of satisfaction of the Court's staff ZLI 10 Average number of training days per person Quantity and quality of audit work can also be improved by considering the impact of the Court's reports and opinions on financial management.
Four key performance indicators (1 to 4) are used to measure the impact of the Court's work.
They were included in the Court's 2010 annual work programme.
38 Number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned In 2009, the Court adopted 91% of the planned number of reports.
The annual report and all specific annual reports were adopted as planned.
Of the planned 24 special reports, only 18 were adopted.
The remaining six special reports were still in the final drafting phase as at 31 December 2009.
Number of reports adopted on time In 2009, the Court adopted 67% of its reports within the specified timeframe.
The annual report and all specific annual reports were adopted on time.
Due to delays in the special reports, the Court failed to set the target for the CLI 6. Further efforts are needed to improve compliance with the deadlines for the adoption of the special reports.
Measurement of the number of key audit notices prepared on time The Court shall submit its preliminary audit results to the audited body in an audit report.
It seeks to increase the proportion of audit communications submitted on time by 10 % per year, the long-term objective being to produce 80 % of the audit communications within the given time frame (two months after the final audit visit).
In 2009, the number of audit notifications issued on time increased by 16% compared to 2008.
External assessment of the Court's financial management: a) Audit opinion of the independent auditor, b) Decision of the discharge authority The independent auditor of the Court gave an unqualified audit opinion on the annual accounts and the use of resources, and the European Parliament, following a positive recommendation from the Council, gave discharge.
Degree of satisfaction of the Court's staff In an internal employee satisfaction survey conducted in 2009, 86% of the Court's staff were generally satisfied with their work (target: 80 %), while the overall level of employee satisfaction was 2.8 on a scale of 4 (target: 2.5).
Average number of training days for examiners (excluding language courses) In accordance with guidelines published by IFAC (International Federation of Accountants), the Court strives to provide examiners with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training.
In 2009, the average was four days.
39 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The Court has actively and fully continued its international cooperation within the framework of the following fora: • in the Contact Committee, composed of the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the EU Member States and the Court, • in the Network of Supreme Audit Institutions of the Countries applying for EU membership, • in the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) and • in the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The Court contributed to the annual meetings of these organisations and to the improvement of international audit principles and procedures and was also actively involved in the committees and working groups set up by these organisations.
In particular, he was responsible for: • Chairing the Working Groups on Common Audit Standards and Value Added Tax set up by the Contact Committee; • Participation in the Working Groups on "Reports of National SAIs" and "Structural Funds"; • Participation in the EUROSAI Environmental Working Group and the IT Working Group, the EUROSAI Group, which prepares a guide to best practices for achieving quality, the EUROSAI Training Committee and the EUROSAI Task Force on the Audit of Disaster Aid Funds; • Chairing the INTOSAI Working Group on the Accountability and Audit of Disaster Aid; • Participation in the INTOSAI Sub-Committees on Guidelines for Auditing Accounting, Auditing Compliance with Legal Standards and Economic Audits, as well as in the Task Force on the Global Financial Crisis.
40 40 PERSONAL AND SUPPORT SERVICES The Court's most important capital is its employees.
As at 31 December 2009, the Court's staff amounted to 880 staff (officials and temporary staff, but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of the staff, 525 (including 115 in the members' cabinets) were audit-related; 163 were translators, 171 were administrative assistants, and 21 were presidents.
The Court's employees have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
SELECTION OF THE HOPHEN'S PLANNING BOARDS TO THE 31 DECEMBER (occupied and vacant posts) Translation Administrative Support The Court has committed itself to achieving its strategic goal of improving efficiency through the best possible use of resources.
Therefore, in 2009, he continued to explore and exploit the potential for efficiency gains in all of his activities by simplifying procedures and streamlining services.
In particular, the resources of the support services made available through efficiency gains have been deducted from these services as far as possible and made available for audit-related tasks.
This process has not yet been completed and its impact will be even more evident in 2010.
For human resources, the Court has defined the assessment of the level of satisfaction of the Court's staff as a key performance indicator (ZLI 9) (see page 37).
A satisfaction survey has been carried out to provide information on this issue and to support the decision-making process in this area.
The Court is implementing measures to ensure that opportunities are fully used to deliver better results in the coming years.

SHARE OF MEN AND WOMEN The proportion of men and women was almost the same.
12.2001 12.2009 The graphs below show the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2009.
Like the other European institutions, the Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities in terms of human resources management and recruitment and recognises the need to promote equal treatment between men and women in recruitment to higher management levels more actively.
17 of the 64 directors and departmental/referee heads (26.5%) are women, representing a slight increase in the proportion of women since 2008 (24%).
However, most of them work in the Directorate for Translation and the Administrative Services.
The increase in the number of women in functional group AD reflects the results of the recent recruitment wave.
43% of employees in grades AD5 to AD8 are female.

Of the 99 Court staff aged 55 or over, 24 of the 64 Directors and Head of Division/Head of Unit are present, which means that in the next five to ten years, there will be extensive replacements at senior management levels.

TERMINATION The Court's recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and staff is composed of both officials and temporary staff.
General selection procedures for Court posts are organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
The Court also provides internships for a limited number of university graduates for periods of three to five months.
In 2009, the Court hired 112 employees: 69 officials, 14 temporary staff and 29 contract staff.
The recruitment depends on whether reserve lists of EPSO competitions are available and sufficient.
In 2009, the Court succeeded in recruiting an adequate number of new staff.
73 vacant posts at 31 December 2009 were reduced by 33% to 49 by 26 January 2010. The number of vacant posts will continue to fall sharply in the coming months, as the latest recruitment wave will result in further audit staff entering service.
At 31 December 2008, 68 posts were not filled.
The reserve list for recruitment on the basis of the EPSO AD/126/08 selection procedure was published in August and the first successful candidates entered the Court at the beginning of November, i.e. only three months later.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING The occupation of the examiner requires continuous training.
In addition, due to the specific circumstances of the Court's audit environment, auditors need good knowledge of foreign languages.
In 2009, the staff of the Court completed an average of nine days of professional training.
Language courses accounted for 64% of the total number of training days in 2009 (compared to 48% in 2008).
Without taking into account the language courses, the examiners completed four days of professional training in 2009 (see ZLI 10 on page 38).
This figure is expected to increase in 2010 as new staff are required to undergo a mandatory training programme.
On the basis of the long-term strategic goal of "Development and Growth" and the 2008-2011 Curriculum for Training as well as the continuing training pathways adopted in 2009, the Unit "Vocational Training" has improved the content of the training activities and has developed new training courses in line with the priorities decided by the Court.
Cooperation with the other institutions and with interinstitutional bodies such as the European School of Administration has also been successfully pursued.
Box 5 provides a portrait of the staff of an examination department within the Court in order to give the reader a picture of the works carried out and the persons involved. 43
44 BOX 5 – THE TEAM COMPETENT TO THE TESTING ON "JUSTICE AND INNER IN ESTIMAL BALKAN" The Western Balkans had been marked by violence in the past.
The European Union's interest in this region is to promote security and long-term stability.
The rule of law, border security and the fight against corruption are essential prerequisites for EU accession and are a major challenge in the Western Balkans.
The European Commission is the main donor of funding in the region.
The Court's 2009 report on the effectiveness of Commission projects in the field of justice and home affairs for the Western Balkans (Special Report No 12/2009) provided an insight into the situation in this particularly important area.
The audit covered investment projects as well as institution-building projects in the four areas of asylum, integrated border management, justice and police.
33 completed projects were assessed on the spot, including an asylum centre, a prison in Albania and a court in Bosnia and Herzegovina responsible for human rights and war crimes.
In addition, several EU-funded border crossing points in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia were visited to assess whether EU action has led to improvements.
The team responsible for conducting the audit worked closely with the rapporteur, Maarten B. Engwirda.
The head of the audit unit was Raija Peltonen and Ossi Louko, and the team leader was Jussi Bright.
The examiners involved were Enrico Grassi and Miroslav Matej, with Horst Fischer and Jan Pieter Lingen from the cabinet of Maarten B. Engwirda also playing an important role.

TRANSLATION Translation is an important activity of audit support which enables the Court to fulfil its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2009, the total volume of translation increased by 5.2% compared to 2008.
The proportion of translation services provided on time was over 95 %.
The language support of examiners in connection with audit visits as well as in the drafting of reports has been increased.
The Directorate for Translation also supported INTOSAI working groups and met other specific needs related to the audit activities of the Court.
In January 2010, a new computerised application (Artemis) was introduced to better manage translation work.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology provides the examiners with essential tools and services.
The main developments in 2009 were as follows: • Simplification of processes and continuation of the transition to a paperless office by applying automated permits (visibility notes) and electronic forms, introduction of electronic signatures and launching work to set up an archive database; • Improvement of the security of the Court's IT infrastructure by establishing a data recovery centre and launching an enhanced version of the Lotus Note platform, the basic framework for the Court's news and audit documentation/archiving systems; • Adoption of a long-term IT plan for the period 2010-2012 to align information technology with the Court's main audit strategic objectives and pursue efforts to deliver high-quality services. 45
46 MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE The Directorate "Finance and support services" is responsible for administrative services and infrastructure.
This includes internal controls and accounting as well as administrative and logistical services.
In 2009, the Directorate focused on reorganising its services to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to release staff for redeployment in favour of audit services.
This reorganisation resulted in a reduction in the number of units belonging to the Directorate (from five to three) and the implementation of several posts in audit services.
An important activity of the Directorate concerned the construction of a new courtyard building (the K3 building).
In 2009, a project manager was appointed after a call for tenders.
Construction will begin in March 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2013.
The time and cost framework set for the project will continue to be respected.
TESTS In the course of the Court's audit work, auditors must travel to Member States and other recipient countries from EU funds in order to obtain adequate audit evidence.
The visits are usually carried out by central and local authorities involved in granting, managing and disbursing EU funds, as well as by their final beneficiaries.
The audit teams usually consist of two to three examiners and the duration of an audit trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of audit and the distance.
Within the EU, audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member State visited, which provide useful logistical and practical support.
The graph below gives an overview of the number of audits carried out by the Court in 2009 in the EU Member States (300).
In addition, 36 verification visits took place outside the Union in 2009.

In 2009, the overall budget implementation rate was more than 92 %.
For Title 1 (members and staff of the institution), this rate is 88%, the lowest in Chapter 14 (other staff and external services) (82%), mainly due to the non-or underemployment of posts and the savings achieved.
For Title 2 (buildings, furniture, equipment and miscellaneous operating expenditure), the average execution rate is almost 100%.
The amount of payments charged to Chapter 20 (buildings) is dependent on the work on the construction of the second extension of the courtyard (K3 building).
The first tranche of funding for this project, amounting to EUR 55 million, was approved for the 2009 budget, which was committed and partly paid in 2009.
The remaining funds for the K3 building were transferred to 2010 and are intended to cover the costs resulting from contracts with construction companies concluded by the project manager on behalf of the Court.
The appropriations will be used in the manner set out in the Court's request to the European Parliament and the Council at the end of 2008.

BUDGET 2010 The Court's 2010 budget accounts for around 0.1% of the EU's total budget, or 1.87 % of the EU's institutions and bodies' administrative appropriations.
The table below shows the breakdown of appropriations by budget line.
Staff resources account for around 76% of the total budget in 2010.
The 2010 budget was reduced by 21% compared to 2009, mainly due to a reduction in funding for the new farm building (C3).
Construction costs for the K3 building are estimated at a total of EUR 79 million, to be financed in four consecutive years: EUR 55 million in 2009, EUR 11 million in 2010, EUR 7 million in 2011 and EUR 6 million in 2012.

50 SERVICE "INTERNE REVISION" The "Internal Audit" department of the Court is intended to assist the Court in the implementation of its objectives through a systematic, methodological evaluation of risk management, internal control and administrative procedures.
The Internal Audit Service also makes proposals to increase the efficiency of the Court.
This requires a continuous evaluation of internal control systems within the Court to assess their effectiveness.
In 2009, the Court's Internal Audit department focused its work on auditing accounting (audit of accounts), checking ex ante controls, auditing the payroll and deposit accounts, monitoring public procurement contracts and procedures, and analysing the promotion process.
Most of the audit recommendations issued by the Internal Auditor in 2009 were accepted by the audited bodies and included in corrective action plans.
The Court's Internal Audit Committee shall monitor and ensure the independence of the Internal Auditor.
It shall also examine and approve the work programme and the internal auditor's reports and, if necessary, entrust them with specific audit tasks.
In 2009, the Internal Audit Service was audited and certified by an independent auditor, Deloitte S.A.
EXTERNAL AUDIT OF THE HOFES The report of the independent auditor on the Court of Auditors' annual accounts for the financial year 2008 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 23 October 2009 (OJ L 347, 12.12.2009, p.
In its opinion, the Court's independent auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers SARL) concluded: ‘As regards the annual accounts, we believe that the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the European Court of Auditors' assets and financial position as at 31 December 2008 and of the profitability and cash flows for the year ending on that date in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down implementing rules for the above-mentioned Council Regulation and the accounting rules of the European Court of Auditors.' As regards the use of resources and the control procedures: ‘Based on our steps described in this report, we have not encountered any facts which we would have to conclude that in all essential respects and taking into account the above-mentioned criteria, a) the resources allocated to the Court were not used for the intended purposes and b) the control procedures established did not provide the requisite assurance that the financial operations were carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.
52 52 DECLARATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO IN THE VOLUME The undersigned, Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, hereby declares in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation, • that the information provided to the Court for the preparation of this report is accurate and accurate13, and • confirms with reasonable certainty that – the resources provided for the activities described in this report have been used for the intended purposes and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and – the control procedures set up provide the necessary assurance of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions14.
This sufficient security is based on the assessment of the undersigned and the information available to him, such as the results of ex post controls, the internal auditor's reports and the independent auditor's reports on previous financial years.
The undersigned confirms that he has no knowledge of any unreported circumstance which could harm the interests of the institution.

4 PRESIDENCY OF THE PRESIDENT Welcome to reading the fourth edition of the Annual Activity Report of the European Court of Auditors. This year we took the opportunity to regroup the contents, namely the two main sections "Our Activities" and "Our Management" and for the first time provide an overview of all performance indicators.
In 2010, the Court of Auditors provided two important opportunities to participate in the debate on the reform of EU financial management.
At the beginning of the year, the Court presented an opinion to the new Commission on the main risks and challenges of improving EU financial management, and at the end of the year an opinion on the Commission's proposals for amending the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the EU.
With a view to 2011, the Court will continue to implement its values and further expand the performance and earnings achieved.
We will once again present high-quality, independent and objective reports and opinions that contribute to improving EU financial management and promote accountability and transparency. In particular, the Court will continue to closely monitor developments in EU economic governance and address the new legislative proposals affecting EU financial management after 2013.
We plan to publish 45 annual reports, i.e. the annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget and on the European Development Funds, as well as the special annual reports on agencies, institutions and other bodies.
Special reports provide an important opportunity to achieve added value by focusing on areas at high risk and on issues of particular relevance to the target groups.The Court intends, in particular, to report on the quality of EU expenditure in a wide range of areas ranging from financial instruments and the SME Guarantee Facility to projects financed by the EU in the field of eGovernment and the single payment scheme in agriculture.
In further implementing its strategy for 2009-2012, the Court hopes to fully exploit the benefits of its recent reforms, including streamlined decision-making procedures. The Court will continue its efforts to recruit appropriate staff, to limit vacancy to a minimum and to promote the professional development of its staff.
Without the commitment and professionalism of all the Court's staff, we would not have achieved what we have achieved in 2010.

9 OUR ACTIVITIES AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINIONS The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are the following: o Annual reports – with the results of its audits of the accounts and compliance audits on specific financial years (including the separate published special annual reports to the agencies, bodies and other bodies of the European Union); o Special reports – which can be published at any time during the year, with the results of its selected audits, mainly economic audits for the assessment of the economy, economic efficiency and effectiveness of selected EU revenue and expenditure sectors; o Opinions on draft legislative acts with financial implications.
Number of reports and opinions 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Annual reports (EU general budget and EDF) 2 2 2 2 2 Special annual reports (EU agencies, bodies and other bodies) 23 29 29 37 40 Special reports 11 9 12 18 14 Opinions 8 9 5 1 6 The full version of each report and opinion is available on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
1 OJ C 303, 9.11.2010. The key messages of the annual report were as follows: • The annual accounts of the European Union reflect the financial situation and the results of transactions and cash flows in all essential respects. • With the exception of two areas of expenditure (Economy and Finance), and ‘Administrative and other expenditure', payments from the budget continue to be substantially affected by errors. • The Court estimates that the most likely error rate in cohesion expenditure was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the error rate estimated by the Court has declined in recent years. • The Commission has improved its data on recoveries of unduly paid amounts and other corrections.
However, this information is not yet fully reliable, and the Commission's information on corrective measures does not allow a meaningful comparison to the error rate estimated by the Court. In the report, the Court makes recommendations on how financial management could be improved by strengthening administrative systems and simplifying regulations and regulations.
The Annual Report on the European Development Funds for 2009 The Court published its Annual Report on the European Development Funds (EDF) for the financial year 2009 on 9 November 2010, together with the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for 2009.
The special annual reports on EU agencies, bodies and bodies for 2009 In December 2010, the Court published 40 special annual reports on EU agencies, bodies and bodies for the financial year 20092.
The Court concluded that the monitoring and control systems ensure the regularity of payments in a conditional manner.In the report, the Court recommended improvements to certain aspects of EDF financial management, including the cost efficiency of expenditure controls, checks on the annual audit of completed projects and controls on the use and monitoring of budget support.
12 Special reports adopted in 2010 When selecting and designing its tasks for economic and compliance audits, the Court is always concerned with achieving the greatest possible effect and with the best possible use of the resources provided for these tasks.
In selecting the topics, the Court shall take into account the following factors: • the risks to economic viability or compliance with legal standards in the area of revenue or expenditure concerned; • the level of revenue or expenditure concerned; • the time elapsed since any previous examination; • future developments within the relevant legal or operational framework; • the political and public interest.
In order to obtain the necessary audit evidence, the selected economic and compliance audits must be carefully planned and carried out. In addition, the Court gives the audited bodies the opportunity to comment on its findings and the formulation of replies prior to publication of the report.
As a result, these examinations usually take more than one year.
EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS EN IMPROVING TRANSPORT PERFORMANCE ON TRANS-EUROPEAN RAIL AXES: HAVE EU RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BEEN EFFECTIVE?
Special Report No 8 2010 ISSN XXXXX-XXX
13 THE MAIN APPS OF A SELECTED ECONOMIC AFFAIRS OR COMPLIANCE TEST Preliminary study to determine the feasibility of the test with detailed details.
Detailed planning with definition of objectives and scope, as well as the approach and methods to be used.
Analysis of the findings and confirmation of the facts by the body examined.
Preparation of the draft special report.
Contradictory procedure with the examined EU institution.
3 The figures reflect the latest changes to the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework and current prices (source: European Commission).
In 2010, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: • Effectiveness of the support measures ‘Design studies' and ‘Development of new infrastructures' in the Sixth Research Framework Programme (Special Report No 2/2010) – "Design studies" are designed to examine feasibility aspects of potential future research institutions and the measure ‘Development of new infrastructures' is intended to support the development of new or improved existing infrastructures.
During the audit, the Court examined whether the two measures have effectively contributed to achieving the objectives of the 6th Framework Programme for Research Infrastructures for 2002-2006. • Impact assessments in the EU institutions: do they help in decision-making?
(Special Report No 3/2010) – Impact assessments are one of the cornerstones of better regulation policy in order to improve and simplify EU legislative proposals. During the audit, it was analysed whether the Commission's impact assessments have effectively supported decision-making in the EU institutions. The comments in this report are also relevant for other budgetary areas.
• Are the Leonardo da Vinci programme's design and management of mobility measures likely to produce effective results?
(Special Report No 4/2010) – The mobility projects of the Leonardo da Vinci programme enable organisations active in the field of vocational training to provide participants with study visits in another European country. The measures are part of the integrated lifelong learning programme. In the course of the review, an evaluation of the design and management of the Commission and the national agencies has been carried out to assess whether the measures are likely to achieve their objectives. • Improving transport performance on the trans-European rail axes: Did the EU's investment in railway infrastructure work effectively?
(Special Report No 8/2010) (see box ‘Beginning an economic impact assessment'). • Is EU expenditure on structural measures in the field of water supply for households being used in an optimal way?
(Special Report No 9/2010) – The Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund have allocated more than EUR 4 billion over the 2000-2006 programming period to support projects in the area of water supply infrastructure for households.The Court examined whether these funds have been used effectively to address a number of needs such as increasing water availability, extending geographical coverage, improving the cost-effectiveness of water supply systems and improving the quality of services. 15
16 EXAMINATION OF AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IMPROVEMENT OF TRANS-EUROPEAN RAILWAY SERVICES: ARE EU INVESTMENTS EFFECTIVE IN THE RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE? (SPECIFIC REPORT NO. 8/2010) The review focused on EU co-financing of rail infrastructure, examining whether an effective contribution has been made to improving the performance of the trans-European axes.
In view of the revision of the TEN-T Guidelines due to take place in 2011, the Court's report was presented at a particularly favourable time.The Court recommended that the Commission: • cooperate with Member States and the railway authorities to identify the trans-European corridors in which there is a significant need and, where necessary, to develop knowledge and improve analytical bases; • place greater emphasis on reducing the practical constraints on cross-border rail transport; • promote and facilitate cooperation between Member States' bodies responsible for the rail sector in order to plan developments together and to achieve common solutions to practical problems.
17 "The test presented the team with some challenges," reports Gareth Roberts, head of the audit team. "We had to familiarize ourselves very quickly with the realities of European rail transport and got to see some examples of success of fantastic modern railways, but also some network sections that seemed to come from another age.
We wanted to explore the extent to which the European rail system is gradually developing from a patchwork to a network.
Up to 10 examiners were involved in the work on site, as we had to cover many different languages. "I really enjoyed working on this test.
Since then I have become something of a railway fan!), says Andrej Minarovič, the examiner responsible for the work in Germany and Austria.
At the end of the test, Fernando Pascual Gil was nicknamed "Mulwurf" within the team because he had spent some time in rail tunnels in the Alps and the Pyrenees. The audit team visited eight Member States and investigated the impact of 21 rail projects co-financed by the European Union under the trans-European transport networks and cohesion policy on trans-European rail transport.
To this end, the team members travelled by freight trains across and through the Alps and visited major tunnel construction sites.
These visits were a valuable addition to the findings gained by the auditors from the review of reports, surveys of railway workers and the usual financial analyses.
18 Conservation and management of natural resources With a budget of EUR 413 billion for the period 2007-2013, the EU has extensive powers and political responsibility in the fields of agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment. Three quarters of the funds will be spent on agricultural markets and direct payments to farmers, financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the "first pillar" of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
More than one fifth of the expenditure is devoted to support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second "pillar of the CAP".
Agriculture and rural development are subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States.
In 2010, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: • Implementation of the Leader approach to rural development (Special Report No 5/2010) – Leader is a bottom-up approach based on local partnerships to promote rural development. The audit examined whether the Leader approach has been implemented in such a way that additional benefits have been achieved compared to the traditional top-down approach while minimising the risks of sound financial management. • Has the sugar market reform achieved its main objectives?
(Special Report No 6/2010) – The EU carried out a profound reform of its sugar sector in 2006 with the aim of ensuring the competitiveness of the EU sugar industry, stabilising markets and ensuring supply and ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural population.
This was followed by the transition to greater regional participation and more flexible decision-making. In the course of the review, the effectiveness of the special measures following the reform was examined.The EU as a global partner In addition to enlargement, the EU has three main objectives in the field of external relations: to achieve stability, security and prosperity in its neighbourhood ("the EU and its neighbourhood policy"); to actively support sustainable development at international level ("the EU as a partner for sustainable development"); to promote global political governance and to ensure strategic and civil security ("the EU as a global player").
Expenditure is largely managed directly by the Commission through its central services or delegations.
• Commission management of the veterinary control system for meat imports following the 2004 health legislation reform (Special Report No 14/2010) – Veterinary controls on imports are an essential part of EU food safety policy and contribute to reducing the risk of outbreaks of diseases and health crises, which may entail high costs to the EU budget. The review looked at how the Commission monitors the EU veterinary control system at border inspection posts introduced in 2006 in the context of the reform of food hygiene legislation.
In 2010, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: • Commission management of general budget support in ACP countries, Latin American and Asian countries (Special Report No 11/2010) – General budget support is generally considered by many donors, including the European Commission, to be the most effective way to provide development aid.
The review examined whether the Commission effectively managed its budget support programmes in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, Latin America and Asia. 19
20 • EU development assistance for basic education in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (Special Report No 12/2010) – Through the "Education for All" and the Millennium Development Goals initiative, the EU and the international donor community have committed themselves to ensuring primary education for all children, eliminating gender inequalities and improving education quality. The audit examined whether EU development assistance has contributed to these goals in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and whether the Commission has managed its interventions satisfactorily.
Revenue The European Union budget is primarily financed by own resources and other revenue. Traditional own resources – mainly customs duties – account for around 12% and VAT own resources for a further 12% of total revenue. The majority of EU own resources (70%) come from own resources derived from gross national income, which ensure that the budget is always balanced. • Has the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument been successfully launched in the Southern Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) and achieves results?
(Special Report No 13/2010) – The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) provides a framework for the planning and management of assistance to partner countries and regions.
Since 2007, more than 311 million euros have been allocated to three countries in the southern Caucasus. In the course of the review, it was examined whether the ENPI was successfully launched there and whether it achieved results.
In 2010, the Court adopted a special report on • Simplified customs procedures (No 1/2010) – In the case of simplified customs procedures, authorised economic operators benefit from accelerated customs clearance and a simplified system for paying the EU's revenue.
The audit assessed the effectiveness of the legal framework and the control approach of the Commission and the Member States.Opinions delivered in 2010 The Court also contributed to improving EU financial management through its opinions on proposals for new or amended acts with financial implications.
21 22 The revision of the Financial Regulation from the perspective of the Court of Auditors Opinion No 6/2010 concerns an important proposal by the Commission for a revision of the Financial Regulation, which regulates how the EU's budget is collected, spent and recorded.
Based on its statements in opinion 1/2010 (see above), the Court also points out that to improve the quality of EU expenditure in certain areas of the EU budget, simpler and better legislation, as well as other measures to support, promote and require economic action by managers at the Commission, the other institutions and Member States.
The ongoing contacts are maintained by liaison officers appointed by the individual SAIs.
The pilot project will be completed in 2011. 24 Network of the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries The Court actively participated in meetings of the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries (Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia)4, which took place in parallel with the meetings of the Contact Committee.
4 as at February 2011. Other forms of cooperation The Court continued its active participation and participation in improving international auditing principles and procedures through its membership of European and international organisations for public financial control bodies, including INTOSAI5 and its European regional group EUROSAI.
A delegation of the Court took part in the XXth INCOSAI Congress, which took place in South Africa from 22 to 27 November 2010.
Since 2004, when the Court became a full member of INTOSAI, it has actively participated in the subcommittees on the various types of examination. In addition, the Court contributed to the Subcommittee "Promoting Best Practices and Quality Assurance through Voluntary Peer Reviews" and supported the increased activities in the area of the development of expertise of INTOSAI members.
Since 2008, the Court has chaired the Working Group on Accountability and the Audit of Disaster Relief.
An important objective of this work group is to develop guidelines in the area of accountability for disaster relief and to identify and disseminate best practices, focusing on activities aimed at actors (multilateral agencies, relief organisations, governments, private auditors). The interim report of the working group was submitted to the INTOSAI Congress in November 2010.
In 2010, the Court also participated in the INTOSAI Task Force "Global Financial Crisis." Within the framework of EUROSAI, the Court is represented in the Environmental Working Group and in the IT Working Group and participates in the EUROSAI Training Committee.
The Court also participated in the working group set up at the 7th EUROSAI Congress in 2008 to draw up a guide on best practices for achieving quality within an SAI. In addition, the Court is one of the auditors of EUROSAI. 25
26 OUR MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY FOR 2009-2012 In recent years, the Court has initiated an internal reform process following a self-assessment and peer review procedure (2008) on the framework conditions for its audit management.
A strategy for the period 2009-20126 was developed to address the identified weaknesses, and the overarching objectives for the period are: o maximising the overall impact of the audits; o improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
Many of the priority actions foreseen in the strategy have already been completed, and the remaining measures will be implemented in 2011 and 2012. Key achievements achieved in 2010 include: o the achievement of the target of presenting 12 to 15 annual reports on economic audits; o the development of new products – a document on risks and challenges for the new Commission (Opinion No 1/2010) and the establishment of a new system for reporting on the follow-up to the Court's recommendations from 2012; o the revision of the Court's rules of procedure for streamlining decision-making procedures through the introduction of chambers and strengthening the governance structure; o the preparation of an overview of all performance indicators; o the further development of the approach for the annual audit of the EU budget (declaration of reliability) on the basis of recommendations from an internal panel of experts supported by external experts; o the redeployment of a number of posts from support services in favour of audit services.
6 The audit strategy 2009-2012 is available on the Court's website.
27 INTRODUCTION OF COMMITMENTS ON THE NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE One of the main recommendations arising from the Court's reform process was that the Court should make use of the possibility provided for in Article 287(4) of the Treaty of allowing certain categories of reports and opinions of chambers to be adopted while maintaining the principle of collegiality.
Following the adoption by the Council of the necessary amendments to the Court's Rules of Procedure, Chambers were established on 1 June 2010, composed of members of the Court and adopting special reports, special annual reports and opinions on draft acts. Prior to that, all these reports and opinions were adopted by the entire College, and this is still the case with the annual reports on the EU budget and the EDFs.
Although most of the Court's reports are now accepted by the Chambers, the Chambers have the opportunity to transfer their documents to the Court for adoption.
All members may attend meetings of chambers to which they are not members without voting rights.
The members of the Court
28 MEASUREMENT DATA ON THE HOUSE'S PERFORMANCE IN 2010 Since 2008, the Court has gradually developed a set of key performance indicators (ZLIs) to inform o management of progress made in implementing the 2009-2012 objectives; o support the decision-making process; o provide performance-related information to the Court's audience.
Since for the first time an overview of all indicators is available for 2010, this year serves as a reference year for future assessments of progress. The Court is very pleased with the results it achieved in 2010 in its key performance indicators, in particular on the quality and impact of its work.
More important, however, is the fact that the indicators clearly show the areas in which progress is needed and the problems to be addressed in order to achieve a future performance increase.
29 Quality and impact of the Court's work The Court assesses the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of assessments by the addressees, as well as expert reviews and follow-up to its recommendations.
Assessment by addressees By means of a survey, the Court asked the main addressees of its reports (the Budget Control Committee of the European Parliament and the Budget Committee of the Council) and the main audited bodies (mainly European Commission staff) to assess the quality and impact of the annual reports published in 2009 (the general budget and the EDF) and special reports.
The assessment should be based on a five-stage scale (1 – very bad, 2 – bad, 3 – appropriate, 4 – good, 5 – very good).
2010 Objective Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's reports by a main addressee 4.2 ≥4 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audited body The results show that the main addressees of the Court's reports find these on average for ‘good'.
The Court strives to maintain or improve this level of performance.
Experts' reviews Two external bodies have reviewed the content and presentation of a sample of the Court's reports published in 2009 and 2010. e reviewers have evaluated eight special reports and the annual report on the general budget and the EDF for both years and assessed the quality of different aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale from ‘significantly impaired' (1) to ‘high quality' (4).
2010 target 3.0 ≥ 3 3.7 ≥4 Audits of the Court's content and presentation of reports by external experts The result shows that the reviewers consider the quality of the Court's reports to be "satisfactory".
The reviews have provided valuable insights and the resulting recommendations will be used to improve the quality of future reports.
30 Follow-up of recommendations The Court uses its audit experience primarily in the form of recommendations to contribute to improving financial management.To make changes, the Court's recommendations must first be accepted by the audited bodies and subsequently implemented.The indicator is based on the recommendations published in 2009, i.e. the latest available annual and special reports.
2010 target 90 % ≥ 90 % Percentage of audit recommendations accepted by the audited body The Court strives to maintain or even improve this high level of acceptance in its recommendations.
In 2010, the Court established a system for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations by the audited bodies.
In the coming years, this system will serve as a basis for a further indicator of the extent to which recommendations are implemented in practice and will lead to improvements.
It will also provide the Court with valuable insights into improving the quality of its recommendations and thus increasing their acceptance by the audited bodies.
31 Efficiency and effectiveness of resource use The Court assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of its resource use according to its ability to present reports and audit findings on time, to fulfil its financial management obligations and to ensure the well-being and expertise of its employees. Timeliness of reports The Court strives to adopt all planned reports within the specified deadlines.
The publication of the annual reports and the specific annual reports shall be subject to deadlines laid down in legislation.
In the case of special reports where there is no publication date laid down in legislation, the scheduled date of acceptance shall be deemed to be the date.
2010 target Number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned 90% 100% Percentage of reports adopted on time 80% 100% Overall, the Court failed to meet the target in 2010.
The Court adopted fewer reports in 2010 than planned, comparable to the previous year's performance (91% in 2009), and although the proportion of reports adopted on schedule increased in 2010 (80% compared with 67% in 2009), there is still a need for further improvement.
While all annual reports and all special annual reports were adopted and published on schedule except for one, this was only the case with three special reports.
Six special reports delayed adoption until 2011.
The Court aims to achieve the targets by introducing further measures to improve the governance of the procedures for special reports by the end of 2012.
2010 Target percentage of audit communications prepared on time 54% 80% by 2012 The performance achieved in 2010 is not yet at the required level, but significant progress has been made over the past two years to achieve the target (43% in 2009 and 27% in 2008).
The Court will continue its efforts to achieve the target.External assessment of financial management The Court seeks to obtain a full audit opinion from its independent auditor on the annual accounts and the use of resources, as well as discharge from the European Parliament following a favourable Council recommendation.
2010 target Yes Yes Unlimited audit opinion of the independent auditor and discharge
Professional Training In accordance with guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Court seeks to provide auditors with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training.
2010 target Average number of training days per person 5.7 days ≥ 5 days 33 In 2010, the required level of performance was achieved, which means an improvement compared to 2009 (average of 4 days).
Staff satisfaction level In an internal employee satisfaction survey conducted in 2009, 86% of the Court's employees were generally satisfied with their work, with a total staff satisfaction level of 2.8 on a scale of 1 to 4. Each value above 2.5 indicates general satisfaction. The Court strives to maintain or improve this result when a similar survey is conducted at the end of 2012.
34 SUPPORT FOR AUDIT The success of the Court's audit activities depends to a large extent on the quality of the support provided by its specialised departments. These services provide the logistical and technical and technical know-how which enables the Court to o recruit, maintain and motivate its staff and develop its professional skills; o disseminate the audit results in all the official languages of the EU; o make the best use of information technologies; o manage its budget and maintain its infrastructure; o carry out audit visits to all countries where EU funds are spent.
Staff Personnel allocation The Court's main capital is its staff. At 31 December 2010, the Court's staff was 889 (officials and temporary staff, but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of these, 557 work in audit chambers (including 123 staff in members' cabinets), 151 in the Translation Directorate, 157 in administrative support services and 24 in the President's services. In 2010, with a view to achieving the best possible use of resources, opportunities to improve efficiency were once again explored and implemented in all activities by simplifying procedures and streamlining services.
Where possible, the number of posts released outside the audit area has been transferred to the audit service, thereby increasing the number of posts used for audit tasks by 6%. This process will continue in 2011.
Breakdown of Court posts as at 31 December 2008 2009 2010 Examination chambers 501 525 557 Translation 163 163 151 Support 173 171 157 Presidential services 20 21 24 Total 857 880 889
35 men women The following graphs show the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2010; like the other EU institutions, the Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities within the framework of its human resources policy and in recruitment.
20 of the 67 directors and heads of units (30%) are women, which represents a steady increase over previous years.
However, most of them work in the Translation Directorate and in the Administrative Services.
2001 2010 54% 46% 50% 50%

After the last wave of recruitment, 45% of employees in grades AD5 to AD8 are women.
74% 26% 70% 30% The age profile of the staff in active employment on 31 December 2010 shows that 62% of the Court's staff are 44 years of age or younger. Age 20-24 0% 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 24 of the 67 Directors and Head of Unit are 55 years of age or older.
4% 18% 20% 20% 15% 12% 7% 4%
37 Professional training The profession of the examiner requires continuous training in order to keep pace with new developments and acquire new skills.
Efforts were made in 2010 to implement the staff redeployment plan adopted by the Secretary-General to move posts and staff from the translation service to the audit service in 2011. On the basis of the 2008-2011 master plan for training and the training pathways adopted in 2009, the "Vocational Training" Unit carried out improvements in the content of training activities in 2010 and developed new training courses in line with the priorities decided by the Court.
In addition, the Court's Translation Directorate provided valuable linguistic support to examiners on missions and in the subsequent stages of drafting audit reports.
The Directorate of Translation also supported INTOSAI working groups and met other specific needs related to the audit activities of the Court.
Work on the Artemis project to improve the functions of this important IT application for translators continued in 2010. Furthermore, the Directorate "Translation" of the Court was actively involved in interinstitutional and international specialised bodies.
38 Information Technology Information Technology (IT) plays a key role in implementing the overarching objectives of the Court's 2009-2012 strategy. The following developments have been recorded in 2010: • the establishment of a cooperation platform in line with the Strategic IT Plan 2010-2012 to support knowledge exchange, in particular in the audit area; • the continuation of efforts to optimise and simplify internal procedures through electronic workflows to increase efficiency and effectiveness; management and infrastructure The role of the Financial and Support Services Directorate is to provide the Court's auditors with efficient, effective and timely adequate support services and to ensure that the necessary financial, internal control and accounting mechanisms are available to support all of the Court's activities.
In 2010, the Directorate continued its efforts to further improve efficiency and effectiveness in order to release resources for relocation to the audit service. • Use of smart phones and laptop com-puters to enable efficient audit work to be carried out at any location and at any time, including in the context of the Court's contingency plan.
Following an agreement reached at the end of 2008 with the budgetary authority on the financing of the K3 building, a key activity in 2010 was the preparation of tenders for construction and ancillary services and their publication by the project manager.
A large part of the contracts for this project were awarded during the year. The time and budget framework of the construction project is being complied with. Completion is scheduled at the end of 2012.
39 Audit visits During the audit work of the Court, auditors must travel to Member States and other recipients of EU funds as well as to the headquarters of international organisations such as the United Nations.
TESTS IN 2010 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Visits are usually made by central and local authorities involved in granting, managing and disbursing EU funds, as well as by the respective final beneficiaries.
Within the EU, audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Authorities of the Member State visited, which provide useful logistical and practical support.

41 In 2010, the overall budget implementation rate was 93 %.
42 2011 budget The 2011 budget was reduced by 2.44 % compared with 2010, mainly due to a reduction in the budget for the new courtyard building (K3). Construction costs for the K3 building are estimated at a total of 79 million euros, to be financed in five consecutive years: 55 million euros in 2009, 11 million euros in 2010, 7 million euros in 2011 and 3 million euros each in 2012 and 2013.

4 PRESIDENCY OF THE PRESIDENT Welcome to reading the Annual Activity Report 2011 of the European Court of Auditors.
In 2011, the economic and financial crisis led to significant developments in the EU's economic governance, which have a significant impact on the future use of public funding.
Against this background, the Court published a position paper in May, highlighting the impact of the measures taken to deal with the financial and economic crisis on accountability, transparency and public financial control.
Later in the year, the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCBs) of the EU Member States and the European Court of Auditors called on EU decision-makers to ensure that the principles of accountability, transparency and public financial control are properly observed whenever public funds are used.
In particular, the euro area SAIs requested appropriate arrangements for public external financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
This resulted in a decision to set up an Audit Committee for the Stability Mechanism, to which a member proposed by the Court will be a member.
Also in 2011 the results of our key performance indicators are encouraging, especially with regard to the follow-up to the recommendations accepted by our audited bodies as well as to the assessment of our audit work by addressees and external experts.
We have been able to increase our output in terms of the number of audit reports and opinions adopted in 2011, but we have failed to achieve the ambitious targets we set ourselves in terms of reporting punctuality.
Our annual reports now contained more detailed information and a new chapter on performance aspects. We also produced 42 special annual reports and 16 special reports along with seven opinions and a position paper.
The scope of our institution's audit powers in respect of Union revenue and expenditure, particularly as regards VAT own resources in the Member States, was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in November 2011.
From 2012 onwards, we will be able to report on the extent to which our recommendations are being followed up in practice.
We will also review our methods of impact assessment with a view to continuing to improve the process of producing our special reports.
In 2011, we published ethical guidelines to further strengthen the Court's audit management framework, and revised the Court's audit strategies and audit guidelines to streamline the audit process and reporting process.
We will also launch a new employee satisfaction survey in 2012.
Looking ahead, in 2012 we will complete the preparation of our strategy for the period 2013-2017.
Some of the most important challenges are already clear: the EU's regulatory framework will continue to develop and we must continue to insist on proper compliance with the principles of accountability, transparency and public financial control.
The need for a high-quality and timely guarantee for the use of EU funds is constantly increasing, and we need to further develop our audits and reports accordingly.
As the EU is subject to a continuous process of change, we will also endeavour to make the best possible use of our audit experience to help policy-makers improve financial management.
Strengthening the EU's financial accountability is an objective that we have in common with other actors and we will try to pool our efforts by entering into strategic partnerships.
Finally, like the other EU institutions and bodies, we need to be prepared to do less to improve the efficiency of our organisation.
Meeting these challenges will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of all the Court's staff.
The development of the excellence of our employees – a fundamental value of our institution – is and remains an important concern for us.
With regard to the professionalism, commitment and results achieved by our employees in the past, I am confident that the Court will be able to achieve these future goals.
Mr Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President 5
7 2011 AT A GLANCE OF OUR ACTIVITIES o Annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund (EDF) for the financial year 2010 with more detailed information o 42 special annual reports on the various agencies, decentralised bodies and other bodies of the EU for the financial year 2010 o 16 special reports on certain budgetary areas or management issues o 7 opinions with contributions to budgetary reform, such as on the modernisation of public procurement policy and on the Commission's legislative proposal on rules for cohesion expenditure after 2013 o Position paper on the consequences of the current financial and economic crisis for public accountability and financial control within the EU and on the role of the Court of OUR MANAGEMENT o continues to be encouraged by the results of our key performance indicators, in particular on the quality and impact of our work o adoption of ethical guidelines for further strengthening the audit management framework o revision of audit strategies and audit guidelines of the Court with the aim of streamlining the audit process and reporting process o implementation of administrative staff in the audit area, which contributed to further strengthening the audit staff's scope in the field of construction in 2008 o
Number of reports and opinions 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Annual reports (EU general budget and EDF) 2 2 2 2 2 Special annual reports on EU agencies and decentralised bodies 29 29 37 40 42 Special reports 9 12 18 14 16 Opinions and other statements 9 5 1 6 8 The full version of each report and opinion is available on the Court's website www.eca.europa.eu in 22 EU official languages.
This led to the publication of the 2010 Annual Report, including the seventeenth Statement of Assurance (DAS), on 10 November 2011.
The 2010 Annual Report presented some changes to improve clarity and information.
These include the transformation of the themes (and the related annual chapters) among which the Court groups expenditure, the publication of estimated error rates by policy area (see below), increased attention to recommendations to improve financial management and a new chapter on performance aspects.
The Court for the first time published estimated error rates for both the EU budget as a whole and for individual themes.
The error rates are calculated by summing up the quantifiable errors detected in the samples of operations examined.
The Court compares the estimated error rate with a materiality threshold of 2 % to determine whether the error is material, taking into account further evidence.
Error rates are not a measure of fraud but reflect the Court's estimate of the breach of the rules governing expenditure.
This includes non-compliance with public procurement rules, non-eligible or incorrectly calculated costs claimed by EU co-financed projects or excessive area information provided by farmers.
The key statements of the 2010 annual report were as follows: o The annual accounts for the financial year 2010 represent the financial situation of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year as a whole.
On the other hand, the payments underlying this annual accounts are substantially affected by errors; the estimated error rate for the EU budget as a whole is 3.7%.
The control systems were partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments as a whole. o The Court's estimate of the error rate for cohesion, energy and transport expenditure (the EU's most error-free area of expenditure) was 7.7% higher than in 2009. o The error rate remained relatively stable in the other areas of expenditure in the EU.
In the field of agriculture and natural resources, the estimated error rate was 2.3%, higher than the materiality threshold.
However, direct payments to farmers did not show significant errors. o The proportion of advance payments – pre-financing – within the EU budget has increased significantly.
The accounting rules and supervisory arrangements have not been adapted accordingly. o When planning EU spending programmes, the Commission and the Member States should pay more attention to defining SMART objectives, i.e. concrete, measurable, achievable, appropriate and dated targets, but also to identifying and mitigating potential risks during implementation.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR 2010 In its Annual Report on the European Development Funds (EDF) for the financial year 2010 (published on 10 November 2011), the Court concluded that the financial statements of the EDFs in 2010 reflect the financial situation of the EDFs and the results of their operations and cash flows in accordance with the financial rules in all material respects.
EDF revenue is not subject to substantial errors.
EDF commitments were lawful and proper, despite the non-quantifiable errors detected in the procurement sector.
However, EDF payments for projects were substantially affected by errors, with an estimated error rate of 3.4%.
The errors identified concerned non-compliance with eligibility requirements.
The Court assessed that the control systems established by the EDF only partially guarantee the regularity of payments as a whole.
SPECIAL ANNUAL REPORTS ON AGENCIES, DECENTRAL BODIES AND OTHER EU INSTITUTIONS FOR 2010 In December 2011, the Court published special annual reports on the financial year 2010 for all 42 agencies, decentralised bodies (e.g. Joint Undertakings) and other EU bodies (in particular the efficiency of the management of the European Central Bank).
The Court gave an unqualified opinion on all audited entities except the European GNSS Agency, as certain assets were not included in the accounts, and the ENIAC Joint Undertaking, because the statement of financial results was not included in the annual accounts.
The EU agencies and decentralised bodies have been set up by the EU legislator to carry out specific tasks.
Each Agency shall have a mandate, a Management Board, a Director, staff and a budget.
The agencies are active in many areas, such as safety, health, research, finance, migration and travel.

12 SPECIAL REPORTS ADOPTED IN 2011 In addition to its annual reports, the Court shall, during the year, publish special reports containing the results of the Court's economic and compliance audits on specific budgetary areas or management issues of its choice.
In selecting and designing these audit tasks, the Court is committed to achieving maximum impact and making the best use of its resources.
When selecting topics, the Court shall take into account the following factors: (i) the risks to economic viability or compliance with legal standards in the area of revenue or expenditure concerned; (ii) the level of revenue or expenditure concerned; (iii) the time elapsed since any prior examination; (iv) the future developments within the relevant legal framework; (iv) the political and public interest.
In 2011, the Court adopted 16 special reports on a number of topics, an increase on the 14 special reports adopted in 2010.
These special reports are presented below in a concise form under the corresponding headings of the financial framework – the EU's multiannual budget.
The special reports are available in 22 EU languages on the Court's website www.eca.europa.eu in full length or from the EU Bookshop.
Sustainable growth focuses on growth and employment, and covers two themes: competitiveness involves promoting research and technological development, networking Europe, education and training, promoting competitiveness in a fully integrated internal market, the social agenda and the dismantling of nuclear installations.
EU expenditure on growth and employment for the period 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 89.4 billion, i.e. 9.2% of the total budget, of which nearly two thirds are devoted to research and development. Cohesion for growth and employment mainly concerns cohesion policy, which is implemented in the form of European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funds for specific areas of activity.
The appropriations will be spent by shared management by the Commission and the Member States.
The EU budget for cohesion for the period 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 348.4 billion (35.7% of the total EU budget).
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o The effectiveness of the SME Guarantee Facility (Special Report No 4/2011) from the point of view of its design and planning, as well as the management of its related operations and achievement of its objectives.
The SME Guarantee Facility (SMEG) is a financial instrument managed on behalf of the European Commission by the European Investment Fund. It provides financial intermediaries with guarantees or back-guarantees for loans granted to SMEs by financial institutions, thereby increasing the availability of debt financing. o Effectiveness of projects in the field of tourism co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (Special Report No 6/2011) in terms of expected results, sustainability, European added value and project design.
The audit was based on a broad survey of projects in new Member States and 26 regions.
During the period 2000-2006, the ERDF provided EUR 4.6 billion of EU funding for tangible investments in tourism projects, selected and managed by managing authorities in the Member States.
14 o The effectiveness of the eGovernment projects supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (Special Report No 9/2011) with a focus on the 2000-2006 programming period and the four Member States, Spain, France, Italy and Poland.
The audit assessed whether the co-financed projects were selected on the basis of the identified needs, whether they were carried out as planned and whether they were appropriate and sustainable.
The ERDF's €6.7 billion funding for the information society should help to develop new safe technologies, develop infrastructure and link regions with broadband. o Effectiveness of Commission management of State aid control (Special Report No 15/2011).
The audit examined whether the procedures and systems ensure that the Commission deals with all the relevant aid cases, that the cases are handled effectively and within the deadlines laid down, and that the Commission is able to monitor the effects of its State aid control.
It is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that State aid granted by Member States is compatible with the internal market of the European Union.
Member States must notify aid measures to the Commission and seek the approval of the Commission before granting State aid. o Implement EU financial support for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia (Special Report No 16/2011) to assess whether the measures of nuclear decommissioning programmes have been adequately designed, whether they have been implemented as planned, and whether the structures for accountability and administration have been designed to ensure the effective use of EU funds.
Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia committed themselves to early shutdown and subsequent decommissioning of eight non-refitable nuclear reactors in the framework of their EU accession negotiations.
In view of the exceptional burden, the EU provided EUR 2.9 billion of financial assistance for the three country programmes for the period 1999-2013.
The EU has a high political responsibility in the fields of agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 413.1 billion, i.e. 42.3% of the total budget.
Three-quarters of expenditure concerns direct payments to farmers and support to agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) – the ‘first pillar' of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
More than one fifth of the expenditure is allocated to EU support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second "pillar of the CAP".
Agriculture and rural development are subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o Single payment scheme under the Common Agricultural Policy (Special Report No 5/2011) – See box: ‘Completing an economic audit' o How good is the design and management of the agri-environmental measures supported? (Special Report No 7/2011).
This report assesses whether agri-environmental policy is designed and accompanied in such a way that there is a tangible environmental benefit, whether farmers are adequately supported by appropriate guidance and correctly set amounts of aid, and whether specific environmental needs are taken into account in the management of agri-environmental policy.
The aim of agri-environment policy is to meet the growing social demand for environmental services by encouraging farmers to introduce or maintain production processes compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment.
This area is subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States. o Recovery of unduly paid payments under the common agricultural policy (Special Report No 8/2011) to assess the effectiveness of the recovery schemes established and operated by the Member States.
The audit has examined whether Member States properly collect and process claims, whether Member States' measures to recover identified undue payments, whether Member States take appropriate action in derecognition of irrecoverable claims, and whether the Commission's supervision and supervision are effective.
The European Union spends around EUR 55 billion a year on agriculture and rural development, and some of the funds are wrongly paid out because of illegal or incorrect applications. 15
16 o The effectiveness of the school milk and school fruit programmes (Special Report No 10/2011) to assess whether EU aid has a direct impact on consumption by beneficiaries and whether the programmes are capable of having the educational impact envisaged and of affecting future eating habits.
These EU programmes are designed to encourage children to eat healthy food through the consumption of milk products and fruit and vegetables, and to contribute to improving the market conditions for these products.
The EU is currently providing an annual budget of EUR 180 million for these two programmes. o Allow the design and management of the geographical indications scheme to be effective? (Special Report No 11/2011).
The audit assessed the reliability of the control system, the attractiveness of the scheme for producers and its awareness among consumers.
The objective of the EU scheme for geographical indications is to protect the names of products which have a link between their characteristics and the geographical area from which they originate.
The scheme has economic potential for farmers and food producers and can have a positive impact on the rural economy in the regions of the EU. o Effectiveness of EU measures to adapt fishing fleets' fishing capacity to existing fishing opportunities (Special Report No 12/2011).
The audit examined whether there was a clear framework for reducing fleet capacity and whether the specific measures were clearly defined and implemented.
The investigation was carried out by the Commission and in Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
The EU's common fisheries policy aims to promote sustainable fisheries by achieving a balance between fish stocks and the fishing fleet in order to avoid overfishing.
For many years, the overcapacity of the fishing fleet has been a problem, endangering both the sustainability of fish stocks and the long-term viability of the fisheries sector.
The European Fisheries Fund will provide EUR 4.3 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period.
17 ACCOUNTING AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT SPECIAL REPORT No 5/2011 OPERATING PREMIUM REGULATION: QUESTIONS WITH A BETTER FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT This audit covered the sound financial management of payments under the Single Payment Scheme, which is currently being applied in 17 of the 27 EU Member States.
Expenditure related to this scheme amounted to around 28.8 billion euros in 2009.
The introduction of the single payment scheme was a key element of the 2003 reform of the EU's common agricultural policy.
The aim of this scheme was to encourage farmers to respond better to market demand and to provide income support.
In the course of the reform, the link between support and production was dissolved ("decoupling").
Instead, farmers must have eligible agricultural land and ‘payment entitlements'.
From 2006 onwards, the Court carried out a series of audits of the procedures established by the Commission and the Member States to ensure the accuracy of payment entitlements and the accuracy of payments to farmers.
These audits covered all 17 Member States applying the scheme and the results of these audits were included in the 2006 and 2007 annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget.
The Court decided to carry out, on the basis of these findings, an economic assessment focusing on the following aspects: (i) beneficiaries of the scheme, access to single payments and the definition of eligible land; (ii) the contribution of the scheme to the objectives of income support for farmers and the preservation of agricultural land in good agricultural and environmental condition; and (iii) the specific consequences of the application of the different models for implementing the scheme.
Verification visits took place at the Commission, France, Italy and the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010.
The conclusion of the resulting Special Report No 5/2011 was that the single payment scheme contributed to the achievement of the two main objectives of the common agricultural policy: farmers were encouraged to respond better to market demand and the income of the agricultural sector as a whole was supported.
However, in general terms, the implementation of the scheme has resulted in several questionable characteristics relating to the definition of the beneficiaries of this policy, the nature of the eligible parcels and activities, the environmental impact of the scheme, the distribution of aid from Member State to Member State and within Member States and the specific effects of the historical and regional model.
18 The Court recommends in the report that it is better for the single farm payment to flow to active farmers and exclude non-agricultural parcels and activities that do not contribute to increasing agricultural productivity or to maintaining the ecological value of the land.
The Court also recommends that the level of the single payment should take into account the costs of environmental and other externalities and that a more balanced distribution of the aid among farmers be sought.
The calculation of the single payment should be based on the current management conditions.
The examination was carried out by a multidisciplinary team of eight examiners from Chamber I. The examination work provided not only further information on the concept of the decoupled single payment, but also on the impact of the conversion process from the previous coupled support scheme on the current scheme.
According to team leader Sven Kölling, the examination of the wide range of models and variants existing under the single payment scheme for the implementation of the scheme together with the coexistence of national and regional administrative strategies and their impact on the profitability and effectiveness of the premium was a particular challenge.
Test visits to final beneficiaries and on-the-spot checks at the premises have proved indispensable in order to obtain the verification evidence to support the findings and conclusions.
Many of the Court's recommendations were reflected in the Commission's proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy after 2013 (at the time of the preparation of this report in the discussion), including the definition of an ‘active farmer' and of minimum activities on certain areas, the distribution of premium payments among beneficiaries, the reduction of the number of implementation models for the single payment scheme and the better consideration of environmental external effects in the calculation of single payments.

EU AS GLOBALER PARTNER 19 The EU's external relations activities focus on: enlargement, achieving stability, security and prosperity in its neighbourhood, active support for sustainable development at international level, promoting global political governance and ensuring strategic and civil security.
The EU has allocated EUR 55.9 billion, i.e. 5.7% of its planned total expenditure, to these objectives, for the period 2007-2013.
Expenditure is mainly managed directly by the Commission through its central services or delegations.
Some support measures are also managed together with international organisations.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o Has the deconcentration of the management of external assistance from the Commission's central services to its delegations led to a better provision of assistance?
(Special Report No 1/2011).
The audit looked at administrative arrangements and their impact on faster delivery and improved quality of assistance and the creation of stable financial procedures.
The EU is the world's largest donor of development assistance, with a large part of this assistance (EUR 8.4 billion in 2009) being managed by the Commission as part of its administrative system, with powers transferred from 2002 onwards to the Commission's external offices in partner countries. o Economic efficiency and effectiveness of EU contributions made through United Nations agencies in conflict-affected countries (Special Report No 3/2011) focusing on projects in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan over the period 2006-2008.
EuropeAid provided around EUR 4 billion through UN organisations in the period 2005-2009.
The EU may provide funds as the sole donor or together with other donors, as contributions to trust funds without providing the funds for certain activities or objectives, or as a contribution to the general budget of a UN organisation. o Effectiveness of EU assistance in enhancing Croatia's ability to manage post-accession funding (Special Report No 14/2011) to assess the Commission's planning of assistance and whether the envisaged results of projects financed from EU funds have been achieved.
The aim of EU pre-accession assistance is to assist the candidate countries in building up their administrative capacity to prepare them for the management of the larger EU aid to which they will be entitled as Member States.
EU pre-accession assistance to Croatia has been worth EUR 150 million annually since 2007.
The budget of the European Union is primarily financed from own resources and other revenue.
Traditional own resources – mainly customs duties – represent around 12% of total revenue and VAT-based own resources represent an additional 12% of total revenue.
The bulk of the EU's own resources (70%) comes from own resources derived from gross national income, which ensure that the budget is always balanced.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this field: o Administration of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (Special Report No 2/2011) to assess the measures taken to implement the recommendations of the Court's previous Special Report No 1/2005 on the subject.
The starting point for the investigation was the question whether OLAF has now shifted the focus of its activities to its investigative function and is more efficient in its investigations, as evidenced by the effectiveness of its investigation work and whether the role of the Supervisory Committee has been clarified.
OLAF's role is to combat fraud and other illegal activities to the detriment of the EU budget.
The Office is affiliated to the Commission, but has full independence in carrying out its investigations and employs around 500 staff, with an annual expenditure of around EUR 50 million.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special report in this area: o Is it possible to prevent and detect VAT evasion through the control of customs procedure 42? (Special Report No 13/2011) In the course of this audit, the Court examined whether there is a sound legal framework for combating VAT evasion under customs procedure 42.
Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Austria, Slovenia and Sweden have been tested.
Customs procedure 42 is a mechanism used by an EU importer to obtain a VAT exemption.
The procedure applies when goods imported from outside the EU into one Member State are transported to another Member State.
In such cases, VAT shall be due in the Member State of destination.
OPINIONS AND POSITION PAPERS PRODUCED IN 2011 The Court also contributes to the improvement of EU financial management through its opinions on proposals for new or amended acts with financial implications.
These opinions will be delivered at the request of the other EU institutions and used by the legislative authorities – the European Parliament and the Council – in their work.
The Court may also, on its own initiative, issue position papers on other issues.
In 2011, the Court adopted seven opinions: o 1/2011: Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 215/2008 on the financial regulation applicable to the 10th European Development Fund as regards the European External Action Service o 2/2011: Financial Regulation of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking o 3/2011: Proposal amending the Financial Regulation of the European Schools o 4/2011: Commission Green Paper on the modernisation of European public procurement policy o 5/2011: Proposal for a Council Regulation (Euratom) laying down the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in indirect actions under the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community and for the dissemination of research results (2012-2013) o 6/2011: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 on investigations carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 Opinion 7/2011 concerned proposals for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on cohesion expenditure, which could cover up to 45 % of total EU expenditure for the period 2014-2020.
The contribution from the EU budget to achieving the Europe 2020 objectives is therefore highly dependent on the economical, efficient and effective use of these funds.
This will also affect the credibility and legitimacy of EU action.
The EU continues to face the challenge of achieving good quality results through a system in which the funds are allocated beforehand to the Member States and the use of these funds is an implicit objective.
Effective monitoring and accountability by the Commission would help Member States to use the funds successfully.
The opinions are available in full on the Court's website www.eca.europa.eu in all the official languages of the EU. 21
22 HOFE'S POSITION PAPER: CONTENT OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITHIN THE EU AND THE ROLE OF THE HOFE The ongoing global financial and economic crisis had far-reaching consequences for the European Union.
To address the crisis, the EU took measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of the financial sector, to promote economic recovery and growth, to provide financial assistance to Member States and to strengthen financial and economic coordination between Member States.
Moreover, these measures have a decisive influence on how public funds, i.e. EU citizens' taxpayers' money, are used in the Union.
These changes to the Union's regulatory structure pose new challenges in terms of accountability, transparency and public financial control.
The Court considers that the implementation of these new measures should be based on the principle that appropriate arrangements for transparency, public accountability and public financial control should be laid down whenever public funding is involved.
The Court therefore adopted a position paper on 19 May 2011 on the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on public accountability and control in the EU and on the role of the Court.
In this position paper, the Court concluded that it would include the new supervisory authorities, the support mechanisms with EU budget guarantees and, where possible, the Commission's activities under the European Semester in its audits.
In the Court's view, the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism should provide for a form of external public financial control.
Finally, the Court notes that, in a number of cases, accountability and transparency issues need to be considered by the relevant EU institutions, in particular by the European Parliament and the Council.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER SAIs The Court cooperates with other Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCBs) mainly in the following bodies: o Contact Committee of the SAIs of EU Member States; o Network of the SAIs of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; o International organisations for public financial control bodies, in particular the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
CONTACT COMMITTEE In accordance with the Treaty on European Union, the Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies shall cooperate in a trusting manner, while respecting their independence.
The Court actively cooperates with the SAIs of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee.
The Contact Committee shall meet once a year with the Presidents of the EU-ORKB and the Court.
The Contact Committee shall provide a forum for cooperation and the exchange of expertise and experience in the field of the examination of EU funds and other EU issues.
Working groups have been set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2011, the Court was acting Chairman of the Contact Committee, continued to provide administrative support to the Committee and actively participated in the various working groups and networks.
The annual meeting of the Contact Committee in 2011 took place on 13 and 14 October 2011 at the Court's premises.
The meeting focused on a seminar on the impact of the European Semester and other recent developments in EU economic governance on the EU's ORCB and the Court.
In this context, attention has been paid, inter alia, to the regulation and supervision of financial systems and financial institutions, state aid to the financial sector and the review of the mechanisms to deal with the euro crisis.
The Contact Committee adopted a declaration addressed to the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission, as well as to the parliaments and governments of the EU Member States.
In addition, the Contact Committee adopted a resolution to take into account the reputation of the SAIs of euro area countries for adequate external financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
Declaration and resolution are available on the website of the Contact Committee (www.contactcommitte.eu).
23 Key speakers of the 2011 Contact Committee meeting: Commissioner Olli Rehn, Luxembourg's Finance Minister Luc Frieden and ECB Vice-President Vítor Constâncio, together with President of the Court of Auditors Vítor Caldeira (third from the left).
24 DECLARATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER AND OTHER JUDGMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC TAXATION OF THE EU TO THE BORROWTH ACCOUNTS OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS. IN THIS DECLARATION DECLARED BY THE CONTACT COMMITTEE ON 14 OCTOBER 2011 THE PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATIONS REFERRED TO IN THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC APPROACH AND THE PRINCIPLES OF FUTURE COOPERATION SHALL BE ENCOURAGED IN ACCORDANCE with appropriate public financial control The Contact Committee is convinced that, whenever public resources are used, the following principles should be observed: o "sufficient transparency in the form of reliable and timely information (including national statistics) on the ongoing or planned use of public funds and the associated risks; o adequate accountability, whereby the decision-makers and the administrators are required to contribute to the management of the funds and the associated procedures for public control;
With a view to an effective response to the economic and financial crisis and its consequences in the field of public financial control, the EU and the Court of Auditors will consider, as far as possible and within the framework of their respective mandates, how to adapt their audit work to the new framework conditions.
In some cases, this process has already begun by introducing new and updated audit tasks.
25 Further development of cooperation between the EU SAIs and the Court The growing interdependence of economic systems in the EU underlines the value of a common approach, which can be gained through close cooperation within the Contact Committee.
This includes: o "joint learning from recent audit results and their impact as a way of collecting and sharing knowledge; o identifying and disseminating current best practices in examining new (and existing) regimes; o identifying gaps in public financial control and possible new audit tasks, as well as new partnerships and considering how best to proceed in this context; o considering the development of specific audit methods and techniques for the SAIs and tools and guidance for their application.
Contact Committee meeting in Luxembourg on 13 and 14 October 2011
26 NETWORK OF THE SAIs OF THE SECTOR COUNTRIES AND THE POTENCIAL COUNTRIES The Court took an active part in the activities of the SAIs network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries1.
The network's organisational structure is comparable to that of the Contact Committee and includes regular meetings of the presidents of the SAIs and liaison officers, as well as working groups, seminars, workshops and parallel audits.
The main objective is to promote the use of audit methods and procedures that are consistent with international standards and good EU practices.
A meeting of the network presidents took place in Istanbul on 8 and 9 March 2011.
The Turkish Court of Auditors and the European Court of Auditors held the joint chair at this meeting, which led to the adoption of the Istanbul Agreement, including a work programme for future activities to be implemented with active support from the European Court of Auditors, SIGMA and representatives of the EU ORCB.
OTHER COOPERATION FORMS In 2011, the European Court of Auditors carried out a peer review of the Norwegian Court of Auditors with the participation of the SAIs of Austria and Finland.
The report was published in June 2011.
The Court continued its active participation and participation in the activities of INTOSAI and EUROSAI.
Since 2004, when the Court became a full member of INTOSAI, he has actively participated in the subcommittees on the technical standards for the various types of examination.
In the course of 2011, these subcommittees began to implement their new work plans, focusing on the harmonisation of the ISSAI framework and the dissemination of standards and guidelines, following confirmation by the XXth INCOSAI Congress in November 2010.
In addition, the Court contributed to the Sub-Committee "Promoting best practices and quality assurance through voluntary peer reviews" and the Sub-Committee "Strengthening support for measures for the development of expertise of INTOSAI members" and the INTOSAI Working Group on Environmental Assessment.
Since 2008, the Court has also chaired the INTOSAI working group on the accountability and audit of disaster relief.
An important objective of this working group is to develop guidelines on disaster response accountability and to identify and disseminate best practice, focusing on activities aimed at stakeholders (multilateral bodies, aid organisations, governments, private auditors).
1 In February 2012, the network included five candidate countries (Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey) and three potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia).
With regard to EUROSAI, the Court is now more involved as it will become a member of the Bureau for the next six years.
The Court took an active part in the VIII EUROSAI Congress (30 May to 2 June 2011), which focused on the challenges, requirements and responsibilities of public administrations and the role of SAIs and the SAIs' audit of independent regulatory agencies.
A declaration was adopted to strengthen the independence of the SAIs.
In December 2011, the joint efforts of the INTOSAI community and its regional working groups to strengthen the independence of the SAIs and to recognise the declarations of Lima and Mexico culminated with the adoption of the resolution "Promoting an efficient, accountable, effective and transparent public administration by strengthening the Supreme Audit Authorities" by the United Nations General Assembly. 27
28 OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS CONCERNING VAT OWN RESOURCES On 15 November 2011, the Court of Justice delivered its judgment in Case C-539/09 Commission v Federal Republic of Germany on the audit powers of the European Court of Auditors in the field of own resources derived from value added tax (VAT).
The case was based on the refusal by the German Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006 to allow the European Court of Auditors to carry out audits of the administrative cooperation of the Member States in the field of value added tax in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 in Germany.
In preparing its Special Report No 8/2007, the Court decided to carry out audits in eight Member States, including Germany.
The German authorities objected to the Court's right to carry out the examination in question.
The German Government argued that the cooperation between the managing authorities of the Member States under Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 was not directly linked to the revenue of the EU, as VAT was to be distinguished from the VAT own resources.
The latter are determined on the basis of a series of calculations and represent a relatively small proportion of the amounts collected by the Member States as VAT.
The Court rejected the argument of the German Government, which was based on a strict distinction between the VAT revenues of the Member States and the Union's own resources.
On the basis of the arguments put forward by the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Auditors, the Court stressed the dependence of VAT own resources on the VAT revenues of the Member States.
The Court reaffirmed that the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax covered the definition of mechanisms of cooperation between Member States which would enable them to combat VAT evasion more effectively and to levy VAT more effectively.
This also affects the availability of VAT own resources for the EU budget.
If cooperation between national authorities is carried out effectively and in accordance with the Regulation, it may contribute to reducing fraud and effectively collecting VAT in the Member States, and to keeping VAT own resources at the level required by the various relevant EU acts, and thereby maintaining the overall balance of own resources.
The Court of Justice concluded that the Court of Auditors had the power to carry out the planned examination in connection with administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax, since it referred to EU revenue from the point of view of its legality and sound financial management and was therefore directly related to the powers conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.
In Case C-539/09, the Court of Justice had to decide explicitly for the first time on the scope of the Court's powers of scrutiny.
The Court's judgment is valuable and encouraging because it clarifies and underpins the institution's powers of scrutiny vis-à-vis the Member States.
The LÁZARO Prize for SCIENTIFIC WORK IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 2010 awarded for the first time the prize for scientific work in the field of public sector audit with the aim of establishing contacts with universities and promoting the development of public financial control in Europe.
This first award was dedicated to the memory of Jesús Lázaro Cuenca, a former director of the Court, who for many years had contributed to the development of the examination methods and approaches of the institution.
The awards were presented to the Lázaro winners Sara Belleil and José Antonio Fernández Ajenjo by the President of the Court of Auditors Vítor Caldeira and the Selection Committee in a public ceremony held at the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg on 5 July 2011.
Both winners presented their scientific contributions at an academic meeting: Ms Sara Belleil: "Contribution à une sociologie des pratiques managériales dans les politiques européennes. L
Mr José Antonio Fernández Ajenjo: "The control of public administration and the fight against corruption: Special reference to the Court of Audit and General audit of the state administration.
29 The European Court of Auditors was deeply concerned by the news of the premature death of Sara Belleil on 30 November 2011 and wishes to pay tribute to the quality and importance of her work. President Caldeira with the Lázaro Prize winners Sara Belleil and José Antonio Fernández Ajenjo
31 OUR MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGY FOR 2009-2012 In recent years, the Court has initiated an internal reform process.
This included the development of its first strategy for the period 2009-20122 with the following overarching objectives: o maximising the overall impact of the audits; o improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
Many of the priority measures foreseen in the strategy have already been completed; the remaining measures will be launched in 2012 in 2 The Audit Strategy 2009-2012 is available at www.eca.europa.eu. The main achievements achieved in 2011 are: o an increase in the number of special reports; in the period 2009-2011, an average of 16 special reports were published per year, exceeding the target of 12-15 reports per year; o important contributions to the reform of the EU budget; o prompting the preparation of regular follow-up reports on previous findings, including an overall follow-up report to be prepared for the first time in 2012; o revised audit strategies and audit directives; o increasing emphasis on core activities by transferring staff from support services to the audit service; o publishing a position paper on the consequences of the current financial and economic crisis on public accountability and public financial control within the EU and on the role of the Court.
ETHIC GUIDELINES FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS Following the recommendation of a peer review conducted by an international panel of experts in 2008, the Court strengthened the framework of its audit management by adopting ethical guidelines based on the INTOSAI's obligations and code of conduct and the International Standards for Quality Control within the SAIs3.
In this context, the Court has established a procedure to provide sufficient assurance, on an annual basis, that its auditors comply with the relevant ethical requirements.
Respect for the values set out in the ethical guidelines, such as impartiality, objectivity, loyalty and professional secrecy, ensures that the Court's employees act in the public interest, unimpeded by external pressure and unaffected by personal or financial interests.
The Court's framework for professional behaviour promotes the credibility of the information submitted to its addressees.
3 ISSAI 30 and ISSAI 40.
32 ON THE WAY TO A NEW STRATEGY OF THE HOFE FOR THE PERIOD 2013-2017 In 2011, the development of the next strategy was launched, based on the achievements of the current strategy ending in 2012.
The Court takes the opportunity to make adjustments to developments in the EU and audit and to take account of the needs and expectations of its addressees.
Members of the European Court of Auditors
MEASUREMENT DATA ON THE HOF'S PERFORMANCE IN 2011 33 Since 2008, the Court has gradually developed a set of key performance indicators (CPIs) to inform o management of progress made in implementing the 2009-2012 targets; o support the decision-making process; o provide performance-related information to the audience.
The indicators are used to measure core parameters of the quality and impact of the Court's work, taking into account the position of key stakeholders and the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of resources.
2011 is the second year in which all indicators were available.
The Court continues to consider the results of its key performance indicators to be encouraging, in particular with regard to the quality and impact of its audit work.
In addition, the indicators show clearly the areas in which progress needs to be made and the problems to be addressed in order to achieve a future performance increase.
2010 2011 4.2 4.0 ≥ 4.2 3.7 3.7 ≥ 3.7 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's reports by the main addressees Target for 2011 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audited bodies The result shows that the main addressees of the Court's reports are on average "good".
In particular, the clarity and usefulness of the reports and the professionalism of the Court's auditors are appreciated.
34 EXPERTS' REVIEWS Two external bodies have reviewed the content and presentation of a sample of Court reports published in 2011.
The auditors evaluated four special reports and the 2010 annual reports on the general budget and EDFs.
They assessed the quality of various aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale from "significantly impaired" (1) to "high-quality" (4).
2010 2011 3.0 2.8 ≥ 3.0 Target for 2011 Audits of the Court's reports by external experts The result shows that the reviewers consider the quality of the Court's reports to be "satisfactory".
The reviews have provided valuable insights and the resulting recommendations will be used to improve the quality of future reports.
CONTINUING RECOMMENDATIONS With its recommendations, the Court contributes to improving financial management.
The indicator is based on the recommendations in the annual and special reports published in 2011.
2010 2011 90 % 93 % ≥ 90 % target for 2011 Percentage of audit recommendations accepted by the audited body In 2011, the Court began to systematically monitor the implementation of the recommendations by the audited bodies.
From 2012 onwards, the Court will be able to report on the implementation of the recommendations in practice and the impact of improvements.
EFFICIENCY AND EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCES The Court assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of its resource use according to its ability to present reports and audit findings on time, to fulfil its financial management obligations and to ensure the well-being and expertise of its staff.
The Court shall endeavour to adopt all the audit reports within the specified time limits.
The annual reports and special annual reports shall be subject to compliance with the dates laid down in the legislation.
In the case of special reports where there is no publication date laid down in legislation, the planned date of acceptance shall be considered as a punctuality benchmark.
35 4 2010 90% Number of reports adopted on time 80% 2011 83% 90% 75% 90% Overall, the Court did not fully meet its targets in 2011.
The very high target for the number of reports was not met, but exceeded the overall target of 12-15 special reports per year, and output was higher than 2010.
All annual reports and, with the exception of all special annual reports, were adopted on schedule and published on time.
4 The targets for these indicators have been modified from 100% (2008-2010) to 90% to take account of unexpected events.
The verification reports shall contain details of the specific verification findings and shall be drawn up after verification visits to Member States or to the Commission.
The Court uses them to confirm the factual accuracy of its findings by the audited bodies. Examination reports therefore constitute an important stage in the examination process.
The Court has previously established that there is a considerable need for improvement in the preparation of the audit reports in terms of punctuality.The target to be achieved by the end of 2012 is: to produce 80% of the audit reports within two months of the relevant audit visit.
2010 2011 Percentage of audit notices issued on time 54% 58% target for 20114 Number of reports adopted compared with the number of planned reports 80% target for 2011 to 2012 The Court improved the punctuality of audit communications in 2011, but the target has not yet been achieved.
Significant progress has been made over the past three years (only 27% of audit reports were drawn up on time in 2008) and the Court will continue its efforts to improve its performance.
36 EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Court seeks to obtain from its independent auditor a full audit opinion on the annual accounts and the use of resources, as well as discharge from the European Parliament in accordance with a favourable Council recommendation.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING In accordance with guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Court strives to provide auditors with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training (without language courses).
GRAD TO SAFETY OF THE PERSONAL In an internal employee satisfaction survey conducted in 2009, 86% of the Court's employees were generally satisfied with their work, with a total of 2.8 on a scale of 1 to 4. Each figure above 2.5 suggests general satisfaction.
The Court strives to maintain or improve this result when a similar survey is conducted in 2012.
SUPPORT FOR AUDIT ACTIVITIES The success of the Court's audit activities depends to a large extent on the quality of the support provided by its departments.
These services provide logistical and technical know-how enabling the Court to o recruit, maintain and motivate its staff and further develop its professional skills; o disseminate the results of the examinations in all the official languages of the EU; o make the best use of information technology; o manage its budget and maintain its infrastructure; o carry out audit visits in order to obtain evidence on the spot in the countries where EU funds are collected and spent.
37 PERSONAL PERSONAL ASSESSMENT The Court's most important capital is its employees.
As at 31 December 2010, the staff of the Court amounted to 887 staff (officials and temporary staff, but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of these, 564 are in examination chambers (including 123 staff in members' cabinets), 148 in the Translation Directorate, 148 in administrative support services and 27 in the President's services.
In 2011, with a view to achieving the best possible use of resources, all services once again explored and implemented ways of improving efficiency by simplifying procedures.
Where possible, efficiency gains from unaudited posts were transferred to the audit service, which has contributed more than half to the 12.6% increase in audit posts since 2008.

38 INSTRUMENTS The Court's employees have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
The Court's recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and the staff consists of both officials and temporary staff.
General selection procedures for Court posts are organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In addition, the Court places a limited share of men and women as well as the other EU institutions, the Court operates an equal opportunities policy within the framework of its human resources policy and in recruitment.
After a continuous increase in the proportion of women over the years, the Court has now reached a balanced proportion of men and women among its employees.
In 2011, the Court hired 75 employees: 23 officials, 24 temporary staff and 28 contract staff.
The Court was particularly successful in recruiting new staff to examiners.
On 31 December 2011, 25 posts were vacant – significantly less than in 2010 (44).
Thus for the first time, the number of vacant posts fell below 3%.
2001 2011 Men 54% 50% Women 46% 50% The following chart shows the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2011.
Of the 65 directors and heads of units, 18 (28%) are women, corresponding to the development in recent years.
Most of them are, however, in the Directorate for Translation and Administration.
According to the latest recruitment waves, 45% of employees in grades AD5 to AD8 are women.
ALTERSPROFILE The age profile of the staff in active employment on 31 December 2010 shows that 60% of the Court's staff are 44 years old or younger.
Age 20-24 0.0 % 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 23 of the 65 directors and heads of unit are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, there will be a major renewal in senior management positions over the next five to ten years.
39 3.8% 16.3% 20.7% 19.2% 17.5% 11.5% 7.6% 3.4% VOCATIONAL TRAINING The occupation of the examiner requires continuous training to keep pace with new developments and acquire new skills.
In 2011, the Court's employees completed an average of 9.3 days of professional training.
Language courses accounted for 54% of the total number of training days (compared to 57% in 2010).
In addition to language courses, the examiners completed 6.1 days of professional training in 2011 and fulfilled an important goal of the institution.
In 2011, improvements in the content of training were made and new courses were developed to meet the audit priorities.
The Court also streamlined the administrative system for training.
TRANSLATION Translation is an important activity of audit support that allows the Court to fulfil its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2011, the volume of translation was comparable to the volume of work in 2010.
Over 99% of the translation services were provided on time.
In 2011, additional posts and staff from the Translation Directorate were transferred to the Audit Service.
The Court's Translation Directorate also provided valuable linguistic support to examiners on missions as well as to the subsequent stages of drafting audit reports.
In addition, the Translation Directorate supported the Contact Committee, INTOSAI working groups and met other specific needs related to the audit activities of the Court.
In addition, the Directorate "Translation" of the Court was actively involved in interinstitutional and international specialist bodies.
40 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology (IT) plays a key role in implementing the overarching objectives of the Court's 2009-2012 strategy.
In 2011, the Court took the following measures: o to strengthen its investment in knowledge management by launching the development of a new version of the Prüfungssupportinstrument (project called ‘Assyst2') on the basis of the recently established cooperation platform; o to actively pursue its efforts to streamline internal processes through electronic workflows in areas such as the management of missions and training activities; and electronic archiving of personnel files to continuously increase efficiency and effectiveness; o to continue support for mobility through the use of smartphones and laptop computers; and to launch an Extranet project, which will also play a central role in simplifying electronic exchange with a wide range of Court partners (including audited bodies, budgetary authority, newly recruited staff, suppliers).
These developments were carried out while strengthening operational security and emergency arrangements to ensure the necessary availability and quality of all the Court's IT services.
MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE The role of the Financial and Support Services Directorate is to provide the Court's auditors with efficient, effective and timely adequate support and to ensure that the necessary financial, internal control and accounting mechanisms are available to support all of the Court's activities.
In 2011, the Directorate continued its efforts to further improve efficiency and effectiveness in order to release resources for relocation to the audit service.
Following an agreement reached at the end of 2008 with the budgetary authority (Parliament and Council) on the financing of the K3 building, the focus in 2011 was on the construction of the second extension building to the Court's main building.
Construction work was completed in the course of 2011, and the shell construction was weatherproof at the end of the year.
Great progress has been made in interior design.
The time and budget framework of the construction project is respected.
The yard is expected to take possession of the building at the end of 2012 and the relocations are expected to take place in the first quarter of 2013.
Analysis carried out in 2009 and 2010 led the Court to conclude that its safety objectives could be best achieved and that the most efficient and cost-effective management of the risks could be achieved if the reception and security services were provided internally.
This was achieved in April 2011 by replacing the external contractor for security services with a small team of contract staff.
The annual costs will be more than 0.5 million euros lower in 2012 than in 2009.
TESTS As part of the Court's audit work, auditors must travel to Member States and other recipients of EU funds as well as to the headquarters of international organisations such as the United Nations.
The purpose of these verification visits is to obtain direct proof of examination.
The visits are usually carried out by central and local authorities involved in granting, managing and disbursing EU funds, as well as by the respective final beneficiaries.
Within the EU, audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Authorities of the Member State visited.
The audit teams usually consist of two to three examiners, and the duration of an audit trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of audit and the distance.
INJURY IN 2011 34 33 32 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 In 2011, the Court carried out a total of 379 audit visits5 – 343 to Member States and 36 outside the EU – in connection with audits of annual reports and special annual reports and selected audit tasks.
A similar number of audit visits were made to the EU institutions and bodies in Brussels and Luxembourg.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION The Court is financed by the general budget of the EU.
Its budget accounts for around 0.1% of total EU expenditure and less than 2% of total administrative expenditure.

44 In 2011, the overall budget implementation rate was 93 %.
For Title 1, this rate is 92%, the lowest in Chapter 16 (Other expenditure for members and staff of the institution) (85%).
For Title 2, the average execution rate is 97%.
The amount of payments charged to Chapter 20 (buildings) depends on the construction of the K3 building.
The third tranche of EUR 7 million for this project was entered in the 2011 budget, which was committed and partially paid out in 2011.
The remaining amount of funds for the K3 building was transferred to 2012 and is intended to finance the contracts awarded by the project manager on behalf of the Court to construction companies.
The appropriations will be used in the manner set out by the Court in its 2008 request to the European Parliament and the Council.
Construction costs for the K3 building are estimated at a total of 79 million euros, to be financed in five consecutive years: 55 million euros in 2009; 11 million euros in 2010; 7 million euros in 2011 and 3 million euros each in 2012 and 2013.
2012 BUDGET The 2012 budget appropriations decreased by 1.28 % compared to 2011, mainly due to a reduction in the allocation of funds for the K3 building.

46 AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS INTERNAL VERIFICATION The role of the Internal Audit Service is to provide independent and objective assurance and advisory services designed to increase and improve the value added of the Court's activities.
It assists the Court in achieving the institution's objectives by applying a systematic and rigorous approach to the assessment and delivery of recommendations to improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.
In carrying out its task, the Internal Audit Service shall act in accordance with the EU Financial Regulation, the legislation applicable to EU officials and the International Standards for Professional Practice of Internal Audit.
In 2009, the Internal Audit Service was audited and certified in accordance with the internationally recognised standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors.
EXTERNAL AUDIT OF THE HOFES The annual accounts of the European Court of Auditors are audited by an independent auditor.
This is a key element of the Court's efforts to ensure that it applies the same transparency and accountability principles to itself as to its audited bodies.
In 2011, the Court's Internal Audit Service presented reports on the implementation of the Court's 2009-2012 strategy; implementation of key performance indicators; establishment of the Court's new K3 building; use of the trust account for payments to eligible beneficiaries; follow-up to previous recommendations.
The Internal Audit Service assisted the Court's independent auditor in all aspects in its audit, with a view to certifying the Court's annual accounts and the effectiveness of its internal control procedures.
The Court's Internal Audit Committee shall advise on internal audit matters and monitor the internal control environment associated with it in the context of the institution's risk management procedures.
In 2011, the Internal Audit Committee and the Internal Auditor analysed the results of the Internal Audit Service's audits, the implementation of the Action Plans with an impact on the internal control environment and the risks to the governance of the institution.
The auditor's audit report – PricewaterhouseCoopers SARL – on the Court of Auditors' annual accounts for the financial year 2010 was published in September 20116.
47 AUDIT AUTHORITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT FINAL AUDIT AVERAGE 2010 TO THE ANNUAL FINAL YEAR 2010: "We are convinced that the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the European Court of Auditors' financial and financial situation as at 31 December 2010 and of the cash flows for the year ending on that reporting date in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down implementing provisions for the above Council Regulation and the accounting rules of the European Union.
48 DECLARATION OF THE PROVIDED INSTRUMENT The undersigned, Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, hereby declares in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation that the information contained in this report is accurate and accurate, and o confirms with reasonable certainty that the funds provided for the activities described in this report have been used for the intended purposes and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and that the control procedures established provide the necessary assurance for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the annual accounts and for the proper management of fraud or suspected fraud.
This sufficient security is based on the assessment of the undersigned and on the information available to him, such as the results of ex post controls, the internal auditor's reports and the independent auditor's audit reports on previous financial years.

In 2012, an important focus of the Court's work was to prepare the Union for the key financial management challenges after 2013.
At the beginning of the year, the Court adopted its opinion on some proposals for regulations concerning the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), probably the most well-known EU policy.
The draft regulation was part of the package of legislative proposals related to the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.
With a number of opinions and reports published in 2012, the Court actively helped to strengthen the new arrangements to which EU revenue and expenditure will be subject during this period.
In 2012, the Court continued to monitor closely the impact of developments in EU economic governance on public accountability and financial control.
This year the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism entered into force and the Audit Committee of this new institution, which also includes a representative of the Court, met for its first meeting.
In December 2012, the Council of the European Union adopted its position on the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism to ensure supervision of euro area credit institutions and the Court announced its position on public accountability and financial control to EU policy-makers.
Many changes in economic governance and the EU budget result from the need to achieve better political outcomes with lower public resources while strengthening democratic legitimacy and accountability.
The Court is well positioned to support the EU in addressing these challenges, given its unique powers and perspective on the one hand, and the audit experience gained over the course of its 35-year history and the partnerships it has established.
Based on its achievements in recent years, the Court's objective is to maximise the Court's contribution to improving EU accountability in the period 2013-2017.
The court is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary.
Europe has changed fundamentally since the Court began its work in 1977.
The structure of the Court and the way in which it carries out its tests reflect these changes.
The Court's audit field has expanded with the accession of new Member States, the transfer of competences to the Union and the establishment of numerous bodies at EU level.
The Court has also grown as an institution, from nine members and 120 employees in 1977 to 27 members and nearly 900 employees in 2012.
This growth enabled the farm to build up a professional, committed and experienced workforce.
2012 was the last year to be covered by the Court's 2009-2012 strategy.
The Court has shown encouraging results over the course of this period.
As this Annual Activity Report shows, output has been increased, external experts consider the quality of our reports to be good, and the main institutional users find it useful.
The level of acceptance of the Court's recommendations by the Commission is consistently high and the Court's new follow-up report highlights the positive impact of the recommendations.
The Court can also demonstrate efficiency gains in the area of administration and translation, resulting in 40 additional staff being employed in the audit area at the end of the period.
In order to achieve the targets for the 2013-2017 period, the Court will prioritise products to improve the EU's accountability obligation, and will enhance and expand its partnerships, professionalism and efficiency.
In 2013, an international peer review team will investigate the Court's audit practice and follow up on the results of the previous 2008 peer review process.
Other key actions launched in 2013 include streamlining the Court's reporting procedures and making even better use of our shared knowledge, expertise and expertise.
With these and other initiatives, the Court intends to support the EU in the coming years in addressing its growing challenges in the field of public accountability and financial control.
Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira President 7
8 2012 AT A LIGHT OF OUR ACTIVITIES o Annual reports on the general budget of the EU and on the European Development Funds for the financial year 2011, improving clarity and information. o 50 special annual reports on the various agencies, decentralised bodies and other bodies of the EU for the financial year 2011. o 25 special reports on certain budgetary areas or management issues. o 9 opinions with contributions to budget reform such as the reform of the common agricultural policy and a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the fight against fraud directed against the financial interests of the European Union.
OUR MANAGEMENT o Adoption of a new strategy for 2013-2017, which will guide the Court's activity during this period, with the aim of maximising the value of the Court's contribution to the EU's public accountability. o Our key performance indicators for the period 2008-2012 show an improved performance; for the first time they measure the proportion of our recommendations that has been implemented. o The further development of personnel policy and the continuation of the transfer of posts to the audit service through efficiency gains in the administrative and translation fields have increased the Court's ability to meet its mission. o Construction work on the K3 building – the Court's second extension building – has been completed so that all the Court's staff can be accommodated at one location.
9 OUR ACTIVITIES AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINIONS The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are: o Annual reports – with the results of its audits of the accounts and compliance audits on the budget of the European Union and the European Development Funds (EDF); in addition, special annual reports on the agencies, decentralised bodies and other bodies of the EU are published separately; o Special reports – which can be published at any time during the year, with the results of its selected audits on certain budgetary or management areas; these are mainly economic audits; o Opinions on draft legislative acts affecting financial management and statements and position papers on other issues at the Court's own initiative.
Since 2008, the number of Court's special annual reports and special reports has increased considerably.
The annual reports have also been further developed: more analytical information is now available, the presentation of the data has been more harmonised to facilitate comparison between areas and over time, and a new chapter on performance-related issues has been added.
The significant increase in the opinions issued is due to the fact that the Court has been consulted on the wide-ranging legislative proposals related to the new financial framework (2014-2020).

10 TEST VISIT IN 2012 While the vast majority of the audit work is carried out at the Court's premises in Luxembourg, the auditors also make visits to the EU institutions, agencies and decentralised bodies, the authorities of the Member States and other beneficiaries of EU funds (including the headquarters of international organisations such as the United Nations in Switzerland).
The audit visits are normally conducted by central and local authorities involved in the authorisation, management and disbursement of EU funds, as well as by the respective final beneficiaries.
Within the EU, audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Authorities of the Member States visited.
The audit teams typically consist of two to three auditors, and the duration of an audit trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of audit and the distance.
In 2012, the Court's auditors spent 6 816 days on-the-spot audits – 6 054 in Member States and 762 outside the EU – and obtained audit evidence for the annual reports, the special annual reports and the selected audit tasks.
They spent a similar amount of time with the EU institutions and bodies in Brussels and Luxembourg.

11 The key statements of the Annual Report 2011 o The financial statements for the financial year 2011 represent the financial situation of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year in question.
Revenue and commitments were not substantially affected by errors.
However, payments were substantially affected by errors, with the estimated error rate for the EU budget as a whole being 3.9%.
This error rate is comparable to that of 2010, which was 3.7%. o All EU expenditure areas assessed individually are largely affected by errors, with the exception of external relations, external assistance and enlargement and administrative expenditure.
This shows that improvements are still needed in the management of EU funds. o The Court's estimated error rate in rural development, environment, fisheries and health expenditure (the most flawed area of expenditure) was 7.7%.
The estimated error rate for regional policy, energy and transport remained high at 6.0%. o The Commission's reservations showed an increase, with the amount considered risky by the Commission's Directors-General increased from EUR 0.4 billion in 2010 to EUR 2.0 billion in 2011.
This is based on the fact that the Commission has recognised the existence of a high risk of error in certain areas, in particular rural development, cohesion and research. o Overall, the control systems examined are only partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments and do not provide for the prevention or detection and correction of errors to the extent that this would actually be possible.
Many cases were identified in which controls failed. o The Commission's self-assessment of its performance has led to further developments which have led to positive improvements compared with previous years.
Nevertheless, in the Court's 2011 impact assessments, it has been established that good quality needs analysis is often lacking, weaknesses in the programming approach hamper reporting of results and impacts and that the Commission needs to demonstrate European added value.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET FOR 2011 The Court devoted most of its audits to the accounting and compliance audits during 2012 to the implementation of the EU budget for 2011.
The 2011 Annual Report was published on 6 November 2012.
The objective of the annual report is to help the European Parliament, the Council and citizens to assess the quality of EU financial management and to recommend appropriate improvements through the submission of findings and conclusions.
The 18th Annual Statement of Assurance (DAS) on the reliability of the EU accounts and the regularity of the underlying transactions is the core element of the 2011 annual reports.
The annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for 2011 included two new chapters which contain more targeted results in the fields of agriculture and cohesion.
The previous chapter on agriculture and natural resources was replaced by the chapter "Agriculture: market support and direct payments" and "Rural development, environment, fisheries and health".
In addition, the separate chapters 'Regional policy, energy and transport' and 'Employment and social affairs' replace the previous chapter on cohesion, energy and transport.
12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR 2011 The European Development Funds (EDFs) are financed by EU Member States but managed outside the EU budget, subject to their own financial regulations.
The European Commission is responsible for the financial management of operations financed from EDF resources.
The European Union shall grant development cooperation assistance from the European Development Fund (EDF) to the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and to the overseas countries and territories (OCTs) on the basis of the Cotonou Agreement signed in 2000.
The expenditure in question is designed to reduce poverty and ultimately defeat it, in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP States and OCTs into the world economy.
The agreement is based on three complementary pillars, namely development cooperation, economic and trade cooperation and the political dimension.
The Court's 2011 annual report on the EDF was published in parallel with the annual report on the EU budget on 6 November 2012.
The Court noted that the financial statements of the EDFs in 2011 are appropriate to the financial situation of the EDFs and the results of their operations and cash flows.
However, 33% of EDF operations were flawed, including an estimated 5.1% of error payments.
SPECIAL ANNUAL REPORTS ON AGENCIES, DECENTRAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER EU BODIES FOR 2011 In 2012, the Court published 50 special annual reports, most of which covered the 2011 financial year, on agencies, decentralised bodies (e.g. Joint Undertakings) and other EU bodies.
EU agencies and decentralised bodies shall be established on the basis of EU legislation for the performance of specific tasks.
President Caldeira at the presentation of the 2011 Annual Report at the plenary session of the European Parliament (November 2012)
SPECIAL REPORTS ADOPTED IN 2012 In addition to its annual reports, the Court shall publish special reports throughout the year, containing the results of the Court's economic and compliance audits on specific budgetary areas or management issues of its choice.
In selecting and designing these audit tasks, the Court is committed to achieving maximum impact and thus making the best use of its resources.
In the selection of subjects, the Court takes into account the following factors: (i) the risks to economic viability or compliance with legal standards in the revenue or expenditure sector concerned; (ii) the level of revenue or expenditure concerned; (iii) the time elapsed since a previous audit; (iv) the forthcoming developments within the relevant legal framework; (iv) the political and public interest.
In 2012, the Court adopted 25 special reports covering a wide range of topics.
This represents a significant increase compared to the 16 special reports adopted in 2011 (and the 12 in 2008).
All special reports are available in 22 EU languages on the Court's website http://eca.europa.eu in full or from the EU Bookshop.
The following pages present the topics of the special reports adopted in 2012, each under the corresponding headings of the 2013-2017 financial framework – the EU's multiannual budget.
14 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – SUSTAINABLE GROWTH EU spending on sustainable growth covers two areas: Competitiveness includes promoting research and technological development, networking Europe through EU networks, education and training, promoting competitiveness in a fully integrated internal market, the social agenda and the dismantling of nuclear installations.
EU expenditure on growth and jobs for the period 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 89.4 billion, i.e. 9.2% of the EU budget, of which nearly two thirds is research and development.
Cohesion for growth and employment mainly concerns cohesion policy, which is implemented through funds for specific areas of activity: European Social Fund (ESF), European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (CF).
The EU budget for cohesion for the period 2007-2013 is EUR 348.4 billion and 35.7% of the total EU budget.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o Financial instruments for SMEs co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (No 2/2012) – This special report assessed the efficiency and effectiveness of the ERDF co-financed financial measures during the programming periods 2000-2006 and 2007-2013. e audit covered a sample of projects in Germany, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary and the United Kingdom and also included an analysis of the management, monitoring and information systems of the Commission and the Member States.
The Court concluded that the effectiveness and efficiency of the expenditure on financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) were impaired because the regulatory framework did not provide an adequate basis for the use of the various types of financial instruments.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of the EU economy and provide employment, innovation and prosperity.
However, SMEs may not be able to meet their financial needs in the necessary form and amount.
In order to support them, the EU is using its corporate and cohesion policy, mainly in the form of aid, and increasingly in the ERDF framework through financial instruments.
Financial instruments are repayable revolving instruments.
According to the Commission figures, ERDF allocations for financial instruments amount to EUR 1.6 billion and EUR 10.4 billion respectively for the programming periods 2000-2006 and 2007-2013.
o Structural Funds – Has the Commission responded effectively to shortcomings identified in Member States' management and control systems?
(No 3/2012) – This special report examined the extent to which the Commission introduced appropriate corrective measures, ensured their timely implementation and had a sufficient level of assurance that its measures were able to achieve appropriate financial corrections to past irregularities and improvements in the systems in order to avoid the recurrence of irregularities.
The examination was carried out primarily on the basis of a review of 40 programmes where significant deficiencies had been identified.
The Court noted that the Commission was quite well able to ensure the correct application of financial corrections in relation to the deficiencies in the Member States' management and control systems, but that it was only less certain that its measures would lead to improvements in Member States' systems.
Structural Fund expenditure is subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States.
Member States shall establish multiannual programmes, which shall be examined and approved by the Commission and subsequently implemented by the Member States.
In the event of significant shortcomings in the management and control systems of the Member States, the Commission is seeking to correct irregularities and improve systems. o Use of Structural and Cohesion Funds to co-finance transport infrastructure in seaports: an effective investment?
(No 4/2012) – This special report assessed the effectiveness of the objectives and outputs of 27 projects co-financed by the ERDF and Cohesion Fund in the period 2000-2006 under the reporting code for ‘Transport infrastructure'.
The Court noted that investment in seaport infrastructure under cohesion policy was only effective for 11 of the 27 projects audited.
Maritime transport is the second most important mode of transport in the EU.
The Commission forecasts growth of 3.8 billion tonnes in 2006 to 5.3 billion tonnes in 2018.
Since 2000, the EU has made some EUR 6.2 billion available from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for co-financing maritime port infrastructure.
15 Examination of EU transport expenditure
16 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – SUSTAINABLE GROWTH o Does the promotion of urban waste management infrastructure projects under structural measures provide effective support to Member States in achieving the objectives of EU waste policy?
(No 20/2012) – This special report assessed the performance of 26 sampled infrastructure projects for waste management and assessed the achievement of the objectives of the EU waste policy and the implementation of accompanying measures in the eight regions where the infrastructure is located.
The Court noted that the effectiveness of the support for urban waste infrastructure under EU structural measures has been hampered by the inadequate implementation of accompanying measures and by weaknesses in EU legislation and guidelines.
In 2010, each citizen of the 27 EU Member States produced an average of about 500 kg of waste which, if not properly collected, treated and disposed of, may lead to negative environmental impacts.
The EU has introduced common standards and targets in the form of directives for the management of municipal waste and has co-financed infrastructure for waste management in certain regions.
In the period 2000-2013, the EU earmarked EUR 10.8 billion for waste management infrastructure. o Cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency investments under cohesion policy (No 21/2012) – This special report assessed whether investments in energy efficiency under cohesion policy were cost-effective, by examining whether the right conditions had been created for planning and financing to enable cost-effective investments in energy efficiency and whether the energy efficiency projects carried out in public buildings were cost-effective.
The Court noted that the average payback period for EU investments in energy efficiency is more than 50 years (in extreme cases up to 150 years), which means that funds for this type of investment could be used more cost-effectively.
The costs of increased energy consumption, the exhaustion of fossil fuels and the impact of human action on global climate change are the drivers of the EU's recent policies to increase energy efficiency.
Since 2000, the European Union has spent almost EUR 5 billion on co-financing energy efficiency measures in the Member States under Cohesion Policy. o Has the revitalisation of industrial and military breaks been successfully supported by EU structural measures?
(No 23/2012) – This special report looked at whether the project objectives were met, whether the EU funding target was based on sound criteria and whether the results achieved were achieved at the lowest possible cost to the EU budget.
The Court examined the performance of 27 projects for the revitalisation of waste land using EU co-financing totalling EUR 231 million and analysed the instruments for the revitalisation of waste land, which form the framework for the specific co-financed measures, in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the United Kingdom.
(The conclusions of this special report are to be published on 18 April 2013.)
In recent decades, more and more abandoned industrial and military areas have become available (so-called "castle areas").
Many waste land is contaminated.
Revitalisation and re-use of wasteland will be encouraged through EU structural measures to promote the protection of human health and the environment and to combat the sprawl of the landscape.
EU funding for this sector amounted to EUR 5.7 billion in the years 2000-2013.
o Response of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the earthquake in Abruzzo in 2009: relevance and costs of the measures (No 24/2012) – This special report assessed whether the measures financed were in line with the EUSF Regulation and whether the construction project "CASE", which accounted for the bulk of the expenditure, was well planned and designed and carried out with due regard to the aspect of economy.
The Court noted that while the other projects financed were eligible, the CASE project was not in line with the EUSF Regulation.
There were also weaknesses in the planning of the CASE project and in ensuring the economy of its implementation.
The 2009 earthquake, which centred on the Italian region of Abruzzo, caused more than 10 billion euros of damage.
The European Union supported the Italian disaster management with a contribution of 0.5 billion euros from its solidarity fund, which was used for rescue measures, for the provision of emergency shelters and temporary schools, and for the CASE project for the construction of earthquake-proof houses.
The Cathedral of L'Aquila in Italy almost four years after the 2009 earthquake o Are there instruments for monitoring the effectiveness of expenditure on older workers from the European Social Fund?
(No 25/2012) – This special report examined whether and to what extent the Member States and the Commission have developed and implemented appropriate tools to assess the achievement of the targets for older workers.
Six programmes with a value of 222 million euro were selected, and the programmes covered four Member States: Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.
The Court noted that neither the Member States nor the Commission could make statements as to the extent to which the ESF-funded measures actually had a beneficial effect on older workers.
From 2007 to the end of 2013, ESF expenditure to support Member States in the field of employment will be over EUR 75 billion, which represents around 8% of the EU's total budget.
One of the most important disadvantaged groups is older workers.

18 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – CURRENCY AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES The EU has a high political responsibility in the areas of agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 413.1 billion, i.e. 42.3% of the total EU budget.
Three quarters of the expenditure relates to direct payments to farmers and support for agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) – the ‘first pillar' of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
A further fifth of the expenditure is devoted to support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second ‘pillar' of the CAP.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o Reform of the common organisation of the market in wine: progress achieved so far (No 7/2012) – This special report assessed progress towards one of the main objectives of wine reform, namely progress towards a better balance between supply and demand.
The focus of the study was the measures "Rodition premium" and "restructuring and conversion of vineyards", which form the two largest areas of expenditure and are crucial for achieving the objective of achieving a better balance between supply and demand.
The Court noted that these two measures were in conflict with each other and that the structural surplus on supply was not significantly reduced.
For the three-year period of application of the grubbing-up measure (2008/2009 to 2010/2011), the EU budget was EUR 1.1 billion.
For restructuring and conversion, 4.2 billion euros were allocated for the ten-year period up to 2010. o Aid for the modernisation of agricultural holdings to target specific objectives (No 8/2012) – This special report examined whether EU aid for the modernisation of agricultural holdings was directed towards EU priorities and specific needs in the Member States.
The Court noted that the measure to modernise agricultural holdings would have been potentially more effective by more targeted use of funds to achieve EU priorities and specific requirements in the Member States, on the one hand, and by the effective use of selection procedures on the other.
This aid concerns the financing of investments in agricultural holdings, ranging from investments for simple items such as agricultural equipment or wooden crates for fruit to investments in complex projects such as biogas plants.
The EU budget for this aid (derived from the EAFRD) amounts to EUR 11.1 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period, representing around 11% of all EU rural development expenditure. o Audit of the control system governing the production, processing, distribution and import of organic products (No 9/2012) – This special report examined whether the control system for organic products provides sufficient assurance that the key production, processing, distribution and import requirements for organic products will be met.
It examined how the various bodies involved (the EU Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States, accreditation bodies and control bodies) performed their tasks within the EU and in managing import arrangements.
The Court noted that the competent authorities in the Member States encountered difficulties in ensuring traceability of organic products, and identified weaknesses in the system which need to be addressed in order to provide sufficient assurance that the system functions effectively and to ensure that consumer confidence is not undermined.
The objective of the EU regulatory framework for organic production is to provide a basis for the sustainable development of organic production, to ensure fair conditions of competition, to protect consumer interests and, at the same time, to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.
A control system has been established to monitor and certify each operator in the supply chain. o Direct aid to suckler cows, ewes and goats under the partial implementation of the single payment scheme (No 11/2012) – This special report examined whether the aid was directed towards the most relevant regions in the Member States, whether it was effective in maintaining specific production and thus avoiding negative social, economic and environmental impacts, and whether it was the subject of appropriate monitoring and evaluation by the Commission and the Member States.
The Court noted that direct CAP support for dams does not deliver better results than decoupled aid.
Following the 2003 CAP reform, agricultural aid previously granted in the form of direct payments linked to the production of certain agricultural products (so-called ‘coupled' aid) should no longer be paid according to production after the introduction of the single payment scheme (i.e. decoupled).
However, for certain sectors and regions, some exemptions from full decoupling have been provided in order to limit the potential negative effects of an immediate transition to such a scheme.
The total budget available for this direct aid for 2011 was EUR 1.0 billion.

20 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – SURVEILLANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES o Implementation of EU hygiene legislation in slaughterhouses of countries that have joined the EU since 2004 (No 14/2012) – This special report examined whether the Commission and the Member States concerned have taken the necessary measures to ensure that appropriate adjustments to EU hygiene legislation have been made in slaughterhouses.
Monitoring, guidance, implementation and funding of measures to comply with hygiene rules were reviewed.
The Court examined slaughterhouses in Poland, Romania, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which had received EU funding.
While the Court found that the systems established to monitor the hygiene rules of the Commission and the competent authorities as a whole were appropriate, the audit identified a number of shortcomings in the implementation of these systems, which demonstrate the need for greater rigour at all levels to mitigate risks.
Member States that joined the EU since 2004 had to ensure that their slaughterhouses complied with EU hygiene rules.
Since these rules generally contained much more stringent requirements than the respective national rules, EU funds were allocated to help slaughterhouses comply with the hygiene rules and the associated modernisation.
Under the Special Programme for Pre-Accession in Agriculture and Rural Development (Sapard Programme), around EUR 117 million was allocated to 241 slaughterhouses.
The support was then continued under the EAGGF and EAFRD. o Effectiveness of the single area payment scheme as a transitional system for supporting farmers in the new Member States (No 16/2012) – This special report examined the main weaknesses, such as payments to beneficiaries who did not carry out (or only a marginal) agricultural activity, payments for abandoned areas or areas used for non-agricultural activities, payments to public authorities and aid concentrated on a few large beneficiaries.
The Court noted that some of the aid was paid to beneficiaries who had only a marginal or non-agricultural activity, including public bodies, and that the distribution of the aid did not take into account the regional specificities of the agricultural activity or the contribution of farmers to the production of public goods.
Moreover, the vast majority of farmers receive very small amounts of aid.
The single area payment scheme is a simplified income support scheme for farmers in the Member States that have joined the EU since 2004.
In 2011, payments amounted to around 5 billion euros.
HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – FREEDOM, SECURITY AND LAW In 2012, the Court adopted the following special report in this area: o Does the European Integration Fund and the European Refugee Fund contribute effectively to the integration of third-country nationals?
(No 22/2012) – This special report assessed whether the European Integration Fund and the European Refugee Fund, which are part of the EU's General Programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' for the period 2007-2013 (SOLID), have contributed effectively to the integration of third-country nationals into the EU, whether the results have been supported by an efficient monitoring and evaluation of the programme, whether the Fund's design has contributed to the effective implementation of the funds and whether the systems for implementing integration measures under the SOLID programme have been properly managed.
The Court found that, although positive results were found for individual projects audited, systems which were unsuitable for measuring the success of the funds had been put in place.
The effectiveness of the Funds was reduced by the design of the programme and coordination with other EU funds was insufficient.
The EU promotes measures to integrate third-country nationals into EU Member States and increases solidarity by sharing the financial burden arising from the management of common external borders and the implementation of common policies in the areas of asylum and immigration.
Expenditure under the EU budget for SOLID is expected to total EUR 4.0 billion in the period 2007-2013.
21 This policy area has been established to ensure the free movement of persons and to provide citizens with a high level of protection.
It ranges from the administration of the EU's external borders to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters.
It includes asylum and immigration policy, police cooperation and the fight against crime.
Expenditure in this area for the period 2007-2013 is expected to be EUR 12.2 billion.
22 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – THE EU AS A GLOBAL PARTNER The EU's external relations activities focus on: enlargement, establishing stability, security and prosperity in its neighbourhood, active support for sustainable development at international level, promoting global political governance and ensuring strategic and civil security.
The EU has allocated EUR 55.9 billion, i.e. 5.7% of its planned total expenditure, to these objectives for the period 2007-2013.
Expenditure is mainly managed directly by the Commission through its central services or delegations.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: o Effectiveness of European Union development assistance for food security in sub-Saharan Africa (No 1/2012) – This special report examined the effectiveness of EU development assistance for food security in sub-Saharan Africa by analysing whether EU development aid for food security is relevant to countries' needs and priorities and whether EU action was effective.
The review focused on EU direct development assistance for the three pillars of food security, namely food availability, access to food and balanced nutrition.
The Court concluded that EU development assistance for food security in sub-Saharan Africa is predominantly effective and makes an important contribution to achieving food security.
However, the Commission did not take sufficient account of the possibilities for EU support for other countries also affected by chronic food insecurity and did not give adequate priority to the food aspect.
Food security is a major and persistent problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where 30% of the population is affected by hunger.
In the period 2002-2010, the EU financed food security measures in this region totalling more than 3.2 billion euros from the European Development Fund (EDF). o The Joint RELEX Information System (CRIS) (No. 5/2012) – This special report examined whether CRIS had been designed to meet the Commission's needs effectively and whether the information it provided was reliable.
The audit included a review of the CRIS documentation available to the Commission and a review of the data contained in CRIS.
The Court concluded that CRIS met largely the Commission's information needs on external actions.
However, after ten years of development, it still has weaknesses.
CRIS is the information system set up by the Commission to support the management of external actions.
The functions of the system have been continuously expanded since its commissioning in 2002.
It is now the main reference information system for the management and documentation of external actions and related reporting and is financed from both the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds (EDF).
o European Union assistance to the Turkish Cypriot Community (No 6/2012) – This special report examined whether the Commission was developing an assistance programme in line with the objectives of the instrument, whether appropriate implementation arrangements were established, and whether the individual projects achieved their respective results.
The purpose of the review was not to assess whether the programme had contributed to the achievement of the political objective of reunification.
The Court noted that the programme met its objectives as a financial support instrument for the Turkish Cypriot community and that, despite considerable constraints, it had generally provided appropriate modalities.
Some results have already been achieved, but their sustainability is often questionable and the most extensive project of the programme has not been established.
About one third of this amount was examined by the Court by means of its sample of contracts. o European Union development assistance in the field of drinking water and basic sanitation in the sub-Saharan region (No 13/2012) – This special report examined whether the Commission had managed EU development assistance to improve drinking water and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa in such a way as to achieve effective and sustainable results.
The Court noted that EU support has improved access to drinking water and basic sanitation.
On the other hand, less than half of the projects audited met the needs of the beneficiaries satisfactorily, and the benefits will only be met if they fail to secure revenue based on taxes.
Improvements in water and sanitation are crucial to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Supply of clean drinking water and sanitation contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction.
EU spending on water and sanitation in the sub-Saharan region in the period 2001-2010 amounted to around EUR 1.0 billion, but since funding for water and sanitation is also provided for in other areas of assistance, the Commission has provided a higher overall amount.

24 HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK – THE EU AS A GLOBAL PARTNER o Contribution of the European Development Fund (EDF) to a sustainable road network in sub-Saharan Africa (No 17/2012) – This special report examined whether the EDF has made an effective contribution to the sustainability of the road network in sub-Saharan Africa, whether the EDF-funded road infrastructure is sustainable and whether the sustainability of road infrastructure has been effectively promoted by the Commission.
The audit focused on the technical, financial and institutional sustainability of road infrastructure, and examined 48 programmes supported by the eighth, ninth and tenth EDFs in six partner countries since 1995.
The Court concluded that the Commission's support for a sustainable road network in sub-Saharan Africa is conditionally effective.
The partner countries visited by the Court do not make sufficient efforts to ensure the sustainability of road infrastructure, which affects roads to varying degrees of premature wear and tear.
Roads and other transport infrastructures are essential for regional integration, economic growth, social development, effective public administration and security.
In sub-Saharan Africa, road transport is the most important mode of transport for passenger and freight transport and accounts for more than 80% of the total transport of goods and services, with the demand for transport growing rapidly.
The EU had committed some 7.4 billion euros of EDF funds in this region over the period 1995-2011. o European Union Rule of Law Assistance to Kosovo (No 18/2012) (see "Introduction of an economic impact assessment").

25 EXAMINATION OF ECONOMY The European Union's Rule of Law Assistance to Kosovo The Kosovo Police and EULEX at Kosovo's Border Patrol © EULEX, 2011, Photo by Enisa Kasemi In its examination of EU rule of law assistance to Kosovo, the Court first highlighted a Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) mission.
Kosovo is the world's largest per capita recipient of EU financial assistance and the scene of the largest civilian crisis management operation ever launched by the Union (EULEX – EULEX).
Court Special Report No 18/2012 addressed the question of whether EU assistance to Kosovo was effective in the field of the rule of law.
The audit focused on the four sectors of police, justice, customs and the fight against corruption.
The Court also examined coordination with other donors and the implementation of EULEX.
The examination of such a complex area was a challenge.
Four verification visits were carried out in Kosovo.
EULEX officials and the European Commission were also consulted, as were local officials, representatives of the international donor community and civil society organisations.
The audit team examined projects under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and Stability Instrument projects, as well as monitoring, guidance and guidance (MMA) measures implemented by EULEX.
Meetings were held in Brussels with the Commission, the European External Action Service, the Council Secretariat and NATO.
The Court also supported a panel of experts.
The Court noted that EU aid was not sufficiently effective.
Although the EU has contributed to capacity building, especially in the customs field, the success of assistance in the areas of police and justice has been modest.
The level of organised crime and corruption in Kosovo remains high.
The judiciary continues to suffer from political influence, inefficiency and a lack of transparency and enforcement.
The limited capacity to protect important witnesses within Kosovo and the difficulty of moving witnesses abroad are significant shortcomings.
In the words of Gijs de Vries, the Court member responsible for the report, the Kosovar authorities do not give sufficient priority to the rule of law and EU assistance should be more effective.
Francisco de Miguel Rodriguez, head of the audit team, says that there is no other place around the world like Kosovo, where so many international donors could be found in such a small area for capacity building.
The Court concluded that the EU coordination mechanisms, including coordination with the international community, need to be improved.
Unlike the rest of the Western Balkans, the lack of a common EU position on independence jeopardises the incentive to join the EU in the case of Kosovo.
In terms of communication, this test has taken a new path.
It was the Court's most cited report in 2012: More than 130 articles appeared on it in print and electronic media.
In addition, a video was published on the Court's website, which summarised the report.
This was a premiere for the court, in which his ambition to reach a wider audience is reflected.
The European Commission and the European External Action Service have accepted the Court's conclusions and recommendations.
The report was presented to the European Parliament and Council working groups.
In view of the importance of its findings, the British House of Lords has decided to look at the report in detail.
26 EU INSTITUTIONS, AGENCIES AND OTHER BODIES In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this field: The administrative expenditure of the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies includes expenditure on staff (e.g. salaries and pensions) as well as on buildings, equipment, energy, communication and information technology.
The total expenditure for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 55.9 billion or 5.7% of the total EU budget. o Effectiveness of the measures to further develop staff at the European Commission (No 10/2012) – This special report examined whether the Commission coordinated the development of its staff to the needs of the organisation, provided further development opportunities for its staff, created an environment that motivated staff members to develop their skills and apply them in the workplace.
The Commission's annual budget for external trainers and teaching materials amounted to EUR 26.6 million in 2010. The annual investment in learning and development also included 230 000 days of staff to participate in training activities and an equivalent of 310 staff to manage and carry out training and career development activities in 2010. o Have the procedures for producing reliable and credible European statistics been improved by the Commission and Eurostat?
(No 12/2012) – This special report assessed whether the procedures for producing reliable and credible statistics have been improved by the Commission and Eurostat.
Improvements are directly related to compliance with the Code of Conduct for European Statistics, which sets standards for the development, production and dissemination of statistics, and with the implementation of the European statistical programme.
There was no assessment of the reliability of specific statistical results.
The Court noted that the Commission and Eurostat have not yet fully implemented the Code of Conduct for European statistics and that Eurostat had not designed the European statistical programme 2008-2012 as an effective planning, monitoring and accountability tool.
Reliable and credible statistics are crucial to the fulfilment of the tasks entrusted to the European Union.
Statistics are needed in almost all areas to formulate, apply, monitor and evaluate the tasks and objectives provided for in the Treaties, and to collect and allocate EU funds.
European policy decisions are increasingly based directly on statistics, and statistical indicators are increasingly being used as triggers for policy decisions or sanctions. o Dealing with conflicts of interest in selected EU agencies (No 15/2012) – This special report assessed whether the selected agencies handled conflicts of interest adequately, whether there are adequate policy guidelines and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest situations, and whether the selected agencies have adequately implemented their policies and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest situations.
The audit assessed the guidelines and procedures for dealing with conflict of interest situations in the case of four selected agencies that take influential decisions affecting consumer safety and health.
The Court concluded that the selected EU agencies did not adequately manage conflicts of interest.
CONTINUE RECOMMENDATIONS o 2011 report on the follow-up to the Special Reports of the European Court of Auditors (No 19/2012) – This report analysed the implementation by the Commission of the recommendations made by the Court in seven selected special reports from 2003-2009.
The follow-up special reports covered three budgetary areas, namely agriculture, energy and external action.
The Court assessed the measures taken by the Commission on the basis of the Court's recommendations.
The audit showed that the recommendations were taken into account: the Commission fully implemented 29% of the analysed recommendations, 49% were largely implemented, 20% were partially implemented and 2% were not implemented.
For more details on the follow-up measures based on the Court's recommendations, see page 39.
27 In 2012, the Court published a new type of report, a special report, which follows up on the implementation of the recommendations made in previous special reports.

28 OPINIONS AND POSITION PAPERS PRODUCED IN 2012 The Court also contributes to improving EU financial management through its opinions on proposals for new or amended acts with financial implications.
These opinions will be delivered at the request of the other EU institutions and used by the legislative authorities – the European Parliament and the Council – in their work.
The opinions are available in full on the Court's website http://eca.europa.eu in all the official languages of the EU.
29 OPINION No 1/2012 ON THE COMMISSION'S LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY FROM 2014 The common agricultural policy (CAP) is to be reformed by 2013.
In October 2011, the Commission published a proposal containing the main elements of a regulatory framework for the CAP for the period 2014-2020.
The new legal framework proposed to maintain the current two-pillar structure of the CAP and thus the two existing European agricultural instruments, namely the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
The Court recognised the efforts made by the Commission to simplify the rules of the CAP (e.g. the absence of different implementation models for the current single payment scheme, the introduction of a simplified scheme for small farmers).
Through its proposals, the Commission has received a number of comments from Parliament, the Council and the Court.
However, the legislative proposals remain basically focused on expenditure and its control, and, contrary to the stated intention, continue to comply with legislation on performance.
The Court took note of the Commission's objective of giving preference to CAP aid to "active farmers", and of its attempt to achieve a more balanced distribution of direct payments among beneficiaries.
However, the Court doubted that the proposed measures could be effectively implemented without imposing an excessive administrative burden on the administrative authorities and farmers.
He felt that the solution might be a combination of general principles laid down in the Regulation and systematic monitoring and expert monitoring of its implementation by the Commission.
It noted that the so-called ‘covering' (shortening of aid that exceeds a certain ceiling) will have a limited impact on the redistribution of aid.
This opinion had a significant impact on the future of the CAP.
More than 2,000 articles have been published in the media on this subject.
The Court was invited by numerous NGOs, agricultural trade fair organisers and other industrial forums to present the opinion to the respective audience, and the European Parliament invites representatives of the Court to participate in working groups on this subject.
Members of the European Parliament have included most of the recommendations in their own legislative proposals.
The legislative package will be voted on after the adoption of the multiannual financial framework.
30 COOPERATION WITH OTHER BORDER ACCOUNTS AUTHORITIES The Court cooperates with other Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCBs) mainly in the following bodies: o Contact Committee of the SAIs of the EU Member States; o Network of the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries; o International organisations for public financial control bodies, in particular the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
Meeting of EU liaison officers in Rome, April 2012 Meeting of the INTOSAI Sub-Committee on Strengthening Skills in Luxembourg, September 2011
CONTACT COMMITTEE OF THE EXISTING ACCOUNTS AUTHORITIES OF THE EU MEMBER STATES 31 In accordance with the Treaty of the European Union, the Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies shall cooperate with each other in a trusting manner, while respecting their independence.
The Court actively cooperates with the SAIs of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee.
The Contact Committee shall meet once a year with the Presidents of the EU-ORKB and the Court.
Working groups and task forces were set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2012, the Court assisted the current Presidency of the Contact Committee (ORCB of Portugal) in the preparation and holding of the 2012 annual meeting, which took place in Estoril, Portugal, on 18 and 19 October 2012.
The meeting focused on two main issues: the challenges facing SAIs in preparing for the next EU financial framework (2014-2020) and recent developments in the response to the financial crisis and the SAIs' experience with appropriate audits.
At the meeting, the Contact Committee decided to set up a task force to analyse the tasks and role of the SAIs, taking into account recent developments in the EU in the development of a new economic, budgetary and financial architecture and the possible impact on the SAIs.
The Court is a member of this task force to report to the Contact Committee in 2013.
In addition, the Court continued to provide administrative support to the Contact Committee in 2012 and actively participated in the various working groups and networks.
In 2012, the Court also supported the initiative of the euro area SAIs with a view to ensuring adequate external public financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
A common position on a proposal for the Statute concerning Article 30 of the Treaty establishing the Mechanism was forwarded to the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union in April 2012.
The final version of the Statutes is broadly in line with this common position as regards the Audit Committee.
32 NETWORK OF THE EXISTING ACCOUNTS AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES AND POTENCIAL COUNTRIES The Court cooperates with the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries.
One of the main instruments for cooperation is the network of SAIs of candidate countries and potential candidate countries1 with its organisational structure comparable to the Contact Committee.
This network comprises regular meetings of the presidents of the SAIs and liaison officers, as well as working groups, seminars, workshops and parallel audits.
In 2012, the Court supported the implementation of the work programme, which is part of the Istanbul Agreement adopted at the meeting of the Presidents of the Network in March 2011.
The President of the Court took part in the ceremony on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Turkish Court of Auditors and paid an official visit to the Croatian Court of Auditors.
FURTHER COOPERATION In 2012, the Court continued its active participation and participation in the activities of INTOSAI and EUROSAI.
In 2012, the Court continued to work on Objective 1 – Technical Standards – of INTOSAI as a member o of the Subcommittee for Auditing Accounting, the Subcommittee for Auditing Compliance with Legal Standards and the Subcommittee for Economic Audits; o the Project Quality Control of Audits and the Harmonisation Project.
To Objective 2 – strengthening expertise – INTOSAI, the Court made the following contributions: o It supported the Sub-Committee for the promotion of best practices and quality assurance through voluntary peer reviews and organised the fifth meeting. o It accompanied the work of the Sub-Committee "Strengthening support for measures for the development of expertise of INTOSAI members".
In the context of Objective 3 – exchange of knowledge – INTOSAI, the Court has been chairing the INTOSAI working group on the accountability and audit of disaster relief since 2008.
In 2012, the Working Group carried out the following work: o It prepared and provides for public discussion the five draft International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI), which form the new 5500-5599 series for guidance on disaster response assessment. o It worked on a draft INTOSAI Guide for Good Governance (INTOSAI GOV) on an integrated financial accountability framework at 1 In February 2013, the Network included one candidate country (Croatia), five candidate countries (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey) and two potential candidate countries (Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina).
All five ISSAIs and INTOSAI GOVs will be presented to the next INTOSAI Congress for adoption in 2013.
In 2012, the Court also took the following measures: o It held the fourth meeting of the Steering Committee of the INTOSAI Committee for the Exchange of Knowledge, chaired by the SAIs of India. o It continued to contribute to the INTOSAI Working Group on Environmental Assessment. o It participated in the joint meeting of the INTOSAI Working Group on Government Debts and the Task Force on Global Financial Crisis – Challenges for the SAIs.
The Court continued its participation in the IntoSAINT project, a self-assessment tool for SAIs under the auspices of INTOSAI, led by the SAIs of the Netherlands.
In 2012, the Court's representatives moderated a week-long workshop at the Norwegian Court of Auditors on the self-assessment of integrity. As far as EUROSAI is concerned, the Court (after being appointed a member of the Bureau) took part in XXXIX in 2012.
The Court o participated in the 10th annual meeting of the EUROSAI Working Group on Environmental Assessment and contributed to the joint review on climate change adaptation presented by the Court on behalf of the Working Group at the 2012 meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC); o participated in the first meeting of the EUROSAI Task Force on Audit and Ethics and participated in the Task Force's activities.
In the framework of the joint conferences of the regional INTOSAI working groups, the Court was actively involved in the VIIth Conference of EUROSAI and the Latin American and Caribbean Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (OLACEFS). The focus of this conference was on the role of SAIs in promoting good governance in the public sector.

In the period 2013-2017, the Court will focus its reports, opinions and comments on: o strengthening public accountability and audit arrangements; o improving financial management and reporting on the implementation of the EU budget and its impact; o improving the design of EU policies and spending programmes.
EXCHANGE IN THE COLLECTION OF THE HOFES Under the Treaty, the term of office of the members of the Court is six years and can be reappointed.
In 2012, five new members of the Court were appointed: Henrik Otbo (Denmark), Pietro Russo (Italy), Ville Itälä (Finland), Kevin Cardiff (Ireland) and Baudilio Tomé Muguruza (Spain).
REworkED CONDUCT CODE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE HOFE In February 2012, the Court adopted a new code of conduct for members, taking into account the changes that have occurred since the adoption of the previous code eight years ago.
In addition, the Court is now publishing its members' declarations of interest on its website, which makes a significant contribution to transparency. 35
36 MEASUREMENT DATA ON THE PROVIDING OF THE HIGH CONCLUSION OF STRATEGY 2009-2012 In 2008, the Court published its first strategy.
This strategy was applicable for the period 2009-2012 and aimed at achieving the maximum impact with the Court's audits and increasing efficiency through the best possible use of resources.
Overall, the Court was able to successfully implement its strategy 2009-2012.
Most of the Court's recommendations were accepted: according to the Commission, around half of the recommendations issued in 2011 were implemented, and the Court's main institutional addressees were satisfied with its annual and special reports, the quality of which is considered to be good and improved by external experts, and efficiency gains enabled the Court to increase the number of staff in the audit chambers by 60 (501 in 2008 compared with 564 in 2011), and reduce the number of administrative and translation staff by 40.
For the 2009-2012 strategy period, the Court established a number of key performance indicators for the following purposes: o to inform management of progress in implementing the objectives; o to support the decision-making process; o to provide performance-related information to the audience.
The key performance indicators are used to measure core parameters of the quality and impact of the Court's work, taking into account the point of view of key stakeholders and the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of resources.
As 2012 was the last year of the 2009-2012 strategy period, the results of the key performance indicators, where available, are presented for every four years.
The Court will update the key performance indicators to be applied in the 2013-2017 strategy period, so that they reflect its new or revised priorities and demonstrate its performance and accountability as a professional audit body.
QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COURT'S WORK The Court assesses the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of assessments by the addressees and expert reviews.
ASSESSMENT BY ADRESSATE The Court, by means of a survey, asked the main addressees of its reports (the European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee and the Council's Budgetary Committee) to assess the quality and impact of the 2011 and 2012 annual reports.
The assessment was made on a five-stage scale (1 – very bad, 2 – bad, 3 – appropriate, 4 – good, 5 – very good).
4.5 4.0 3.5 3.9 4.2 4.0 4.2 105% of the target ASSESSMENT OF THE COURT'S AUDIT REPORTS BY HAUPTADRESSATS 37 2009 2010 2011 2012 Outcome target The result remained stable over the entire period with a value between 3.9 and 4.2 on the five-stage scale.
It shows that the main addressees of the Court's reports are their quality and effect on average for "good."
In 2012, the Court achieved a result for this indicator, which was five percent higher than the target.
38 EXPERTS REVIEWS Each year, independent external bodies have reviewed the content and presentation of a sample of Court reports.
In 2012, the reviewers assessed eight special reports and the 2011 annual reports.
They assessed the quality of different aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale from "significantly impaired" (1) to "high-quality" (4).
3.5 3.0 2.5 3.0 2.8 3.0 106% of target 2011 2012 4.0 3.5 3.0 FEEDBACK OF MAIN TESTED BOARDS 3.7 3.7 3.6 97% of target 2.8 REVIEW OF THE HOFE'S REPORTS BY EXPERTS 2009 2010 3.5 2009 2010 2011 2012 Outcome Target Outcome Target Outcome The result was between 2.8 and 3.0 on the four-stage scale in the period 2009-2012 and shows that the external experts assess the quality of the Court's reports as ‘satisfactory'.
The reviews have provided the Court with valuable information on the quality of its reports and the recommendations of the reviewers are used for further improvements.
FEEDBACK OF THE IMPORTANT CERTIFICATE REVIEWS OF THE MAIN audited bodies on the quality and impact of the audits carried out by the Court in 2012 were obtained on the basis of a survey and assessment scale based on the evaluation carried out by the addressees.
The results ranged from 3.5 to 3.7 on the five-stage scale in the period 2009-2012. The results show that the main audited bodies rate the Court's audits on average as ‘good'.
Overall, the results of the evaluations carried out between 2009 and 2012 by the addressees are positive and indicate that the main addressees of the Court value the quality and impact of the reports.
RECOMMENDATIONS The Court uses its audit experience primarily in the form of recommendations made in its reports in order to contribute to improving financial management.
In order to make changes, the Court's recommendations must first be accepted by the audited bodies and then implemented.
The farm therefore measures both parameters.

The target set for this indicator has been exceeded every year.
In 2011, the Court began to systematically monitor the implementation of its recommendations, taking into account that the implementation of some recommendations can take a long time due to their scale or complexity.
According to the Commission statistics, 63 % of the almost 500 recommendations submitted in the period 2009-2012 were implemented at the end of 2012.
More than half of the recommendations made in 2011 have already been implemented.

40 EFFICIENCY AND EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCES The Court assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of its resource use according to its ability to present reports and audit findings on time, to fulfil its financial management obligations and to ensure the well-being and expertise of its staff.
REPORTING REPORTS The Court monitors the effectiveness of its reporting process by comparing the number of reports planned for the year with the number of reports adopted and by examining whether these reports have been adopted within the time limits set.
100 % 90 % 80 % 70 % 79 % 2008 91 % 2009 90 % 2010 83 % 2011 93 % 103% of the 2012 target 100 % 90 % 70 % 60 % 2008 67% 2009 80 % 2010 Outcome 75 % 73 % 81 % of the 2012 target NUMBER OF REPORTS ADOPTED BY THE HOF ON THE NUMBER OF ORIGINAL REPORTS Outcome Objective This indicator has been measured since 2008 and the number of reports actually adopted compared to the number of reports originally planned ranged from 79 % to 93 %.
The measurement has shown that most of the annual targets have been achieved, but further improvements are possible, in particular in the preparation of special reports.
The punctuality of the reports has also been measured since 2008.
The performance measurement is based on the deadlines for the annual reports and the special annual reports laid down in the legislation. The corresponding deadlines for the special reports are laid down in the relevant planning documents.
NUMBER OF TERMINAL RIGHTS RECOMMENDED REPORTS OF THE HOFES 2011 2012 Objective
The result ranged from 67% to 73% between 2008 and 2012, thus remaining below the 90 % target set for this indicator.
The main reasons for this were an ambitious planning for the special reports and unpredictable events in the audit process.
The Court notes that while the accuracy of the planning of audits and the efficiency of audit implementation can be further improved, during the period 2008-2012 it has not only succeeded in significantly increasing the number of special reports produced, but also in bringing them closer to the target of 18 months.
In the period 2008-2012, 85 special reports were adopted (compared to 51 special reports in the period 2003-2007), and the average lead time was reduced from 25 months in 2008 to 20 months in 2012.
The Court's 2013-2017 strategy includes a new initiative to further streamline reporting in order to improve the punctuality of reports and efficiency.
The Court uses audit notices to confirm the accuracy of the specific audit findings by the audited bodies.
Examination reports are therefore an important stage in the examination process.
In accordance with the Court's internal rules, audit reports should be drawn up within two months of the relevant audit visit, taking into account annually the extent to which this deadline has been complied with.
70 % 60 % 50 % 40 % 20 % 54 % 58 % 61 % 90 % of the 2012 target 27 % 2008 2009 2010 2011 Outcome Objective LIKELIHOOD OF THE HOFE'S AUDITS 43 % The Court found that there was a significant need for improvement in the preparation of the audit communications in terms of punctuality.
When the Court started measuring in 2008, it set two targets for the punctuality of audit notifications, namely to improve performance by 10 percent per year and to ensure that 80% of audit notifications are prepared on time at the end of 2012.
This indicator had a range of 27% to 61% over the period 2008-2012.
Although performance has improved significantly and the annual targets have largely been met, 2012 results are still below the long-term target of 80%.
The Court will continue to seek to achieve even better performance in this area. 41
42 EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Court strives to obtain a full audit opinion from its independent auditor on the annual accounts and the use of resources, as well as discharge from the European Parliament following a favourable Council recommendation.
Full audit opinion Discharge is granted EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF THE HOFE BY BUDGET YEARS for April 2013 2008 2009 2010 2011 The Court received every year from the independent auditor a full audit opinion and discharge from the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the budget.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING In accordance with guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Court strives to provide auditors with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training.

Seminar on automatic translation procedures, January 2012 In the period 2009-2012, an auditor of the Court accounted for an average of 5.3 training days per year.
If the language courses are taken into account, an examiner averages 10.6 training days per year.
The target set for continuing vocational training has been met every year since 2010.
COOPERATION ACCESS The Court conducted internal surveys in 2009 and 2012 to measure the satisfaction of its employees.
Two indicators were derived from this survey: the percentage of employees generally satisfied with their work and the average level of employee satisfaction overall.
A scale of 1 to 4 was used, with each value above 2.5 suggesting general satisfaction.
TOTAL OF CHILDREN'S LIVING PERSONAL WORKERS OF THE HIGH GRAD OF CHILDREN'S SAFETY 100 % 90 % 80 % 70 % 4 86 % 86 % 3 2 2.8 2.8 2009 2012 Result 2009 2012 Result These two surveys were very similar: 86 % of employees were generally satisfied with their work and the overall level of employee satisfaction was 2.8.
The results can therefore be considered good.
1 43 44 SUPPORT FOR AUDIT ACTIVITIES PERSONAL RESOURCES PERSONAL RESOURCES The Court's most important capital is its employees.
At 31 December 2012, the staff of the Court amounted to 887 staff (officials and temporary staff, but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of these, 573 are in examination chambers (including 123 staff in members' cabinets).
With a view to the objective of the best possible use of resources, possibilities of increasing efficiency were once again explored and implemented in all activities in 2012 by simplifying procedures.
As far as possible, posts released from the audit area through efficiency gains were transferred to the audit service and the President's services.
This increased the number of audit posts by 14.4% since 2008, while the total number of posts approved to the Court increased by only 3.5%.
Output increased significantly over the same period (see page 9).

In addition, the Court provides for a limited number of university graduates to have an EMPLOYMENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN Like the other EU institutions, the Court conducts a policy of equal opportunities in terms of human resources management and recruitment.
After a continuous increase in the proportion of women over the years, the Court has now reached an almost balanced proportion of men and women among its employees.
At the end of 2012, the Court adopted an action plan on equal opportunities aimed at achieving a more balanced proportion of men and women at all levels of the institution.
In 2012, the Court hired 78 staff: 50 officials, 11 temporary staff and 17 contract staff.
The number of vacancies has been close to 3% since 2011 (on 31 December 2012 there were 28 vacancies).
46 The following graphs show the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2012.
The proportion of women at AD level reached the 40% mark in 2012 and is likely to continue to increase in the future, as 46% of employees in initial grades AD5 to AD8 are women after the last recruitment waves.
Of the 69 directors and heads of units, 21 (30%) are women, corresponding to the development of recent years.
Most of them are employed in the Translation Directorate and in the Administrative Services.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING The occupation of the examiner requires continuous training in order to keep pace with new developments and to acquire new skills.
In addition, due to the specific circumstances of the Court's audit environment, auditors need good knowledge of foreign languages.
In 2012, the Court staff (auditors and other staff) completed on average 8 days of professional training (9.3 days in 2011).
Language courses accounted for 52% of the total number of training days (compared to 54% in 2011).
Translation is an activity of audit support which enables the Court to fulfil its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2012, the translation volume reached a peak of 158,861 pages, 11% higher than in 2011.
More than 99% of the translations were completed on time.
Information technology makes a decisive contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Court.
2012 was a successful year: o In the field of knowledge management, the Court's first version of the new audit support instrument (ASSYST2) was set up and a pilot phase was launched in an audit unit.
In addition, a first knowledge network (Community of practice) on the subject of financial crisis was supported by the provision of information technology and content. In 2012 improvements in the content of the training activities were made and new courses were developed to meet the priorities in the audit area.
In addition, the establishment of a new paperless system and the development of e-learning made it possible to manage training activities more efficiently.
TRANSLATION INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The Court's Translation Directorate also provided linguistic support to auditors in Member States' audits and subsequent stages of drafting audit reports.
It also supported INTOSAI working groups and met other specific needs related to the Court's audit activities. o The automation of administrative procedures has been actively pursued through the introduction of ECAdemy to support the Court's training policy, through decentralisation of time recording, saving staff resources, and through the complete digitisation of staff records. o A great success has been the move of the Court's data centre to the new K3 building.
The commissioning of the new building was also accompanied by a new telephone system and a new data network. 47
48 MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE In 2012, the Financial and Support Services Directorate continued to provide: a) provide adequate resources, services and infrastructure to enable the Court to fulfil its mission and achieve its strategic objectives, and b) ensure that the necessary financing, internal control and accounting mechanisms are available to support all of the Court's activities.
In order to provide the staff of the farm with a safe, comfortable and ergonomic working environment and to ensure that all employees of the farm work in one location, a second extension building was commissioned in 2003.
The farm took the building down in November 2012, and the first moves took place before the end of the year.
In 2012, the Directorate organised its activities even more efficiently and economically.
In October 2012, the Court's office in Brussels was moved to another location.
It is now located in the MTS (Montoyer-Science) building on Rue Montoyer 30/ Rue de la Science in Brussels.
REFERENCES PREPARATION OF THE K3 BUILDING The K3 building was completed on time, in accordance with quality regulations and within the financial framework.
Complementary work will be carried out in 2013 in the other buildings of the yard.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union.
The Court's budget accounts for about 0.1% of total EU expenditure and 1.72% of total administrative expenditure.

For Title 1, this rate is 96%, lowest in Chapter 14 (Other staff and external services) and Article 162 (Services) of Chapter 16 (Other expenditure for members and staff of the institution) (92%).
For Title 2, the average execution rate is 99%.
The amount of the payments charged to Chapter 20 (buildings) depends on the work of the construction of the second extension of the courtyard (K3 building).
The fourth tranche of EUR 3 million for this project was entered in the 2012 budget, which was committed and partially paid out in 2012.
The remaining amount of the funds for the K3 building was transferred to 2013 and is intended to finance the contracts awarded by the project manager on behalf of the Court to construction companies.
The construction costs for the K3 building are estimated at a total of 79 million euros, to be financed in five consecutive years: 55 million euros in 2009, 11 million euros in 2010, 7 million euros in 2011 and 6 million euros in 2012 and 2013.

52 AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS EXTERNAL AUDIT OF THE COURT The Court's annual accounts are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important example of the Court applying the same transparency and accountability principles to itself as to the bodies it assesses.
The auditor's audit report – PricewaterhouseCoopers SARL – on the Court's financial statements for the financial year 2011 was published in October 20122.
BUDGET YEAR 2011 TO THE ANNUAL FINANCING DECISION "We believe that the annual accounts give a true picture of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2011, as well as of the profitability and cash flows for the year ending on that reporting date, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the above-mentioned Council Regulation and the accounting rules of the European Union (EC accounting rules), in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and the Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 on the implementation of the above-mentioned Council Regulation, as well as the accounting rules of the European Union (EC accounting rules), "In our work described in this report, we have not encountered situations from which we should conclude that, in all material matters and taking into account the above-mentioned criteria (b), the control procedures set up do not provide the necessary assurance that the financial operations have been carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

Done at Luxembourg, 7 March 2013 Eduardo Ruiz García Secretary-General
54 35 YEARS IN THE SERVICE OF A BETTER FUNCTIONING OF THE EU The European Court of Auditors has been the external auditor of the EU for 35 years. It continuously provides added value for the financial management of the Union and ensures public accountability for the use of taxpayers' money.
The Court was founded at a time when the European Community (the forerunner of the European Union) was developing towards more democracy and becoming more accountable to its citizens.
Two particularly important steps were the enlargement of the European Parliament's budgetary control powers and the full financing of the European Community's budget from its own resources.
The Community recognised the need for an independent external auditor to assist Parliament and the Council in ensuring democratic control of finances.
Mr Heinrich Aigner, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, who had been strongly in favour of an external audit body at Community level since 1973, challenged the initiative leading to the establishment of the European Court of Auditors by the Treaty of Brussels on 22 July 1975.
The Court began its activities in October 1977, with its headquarters in Luxembourg.
The then President of the Court of Justice, Hans Kutscher, praised the Court as a financial conscience of the Community.
On 1 November 1993, the Court acquired the status of a full-fledged European institution with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, thereby guaranteeing its independence and authority as an equivalent body.
The Maastricht Treaty also introduced what is now a core product of the Court, namely the DAS (Déclaration d'assurance) on the accounts of the EU and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the annual accounts.
The Court's role was strengthened with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999, which strengthened the Court's independence and extended its audit powers to other policy areas.
The Treaty of Nice of 1 February 2003 confirmed the principle that the Court should be composed of a member from each Member State and stressed the importance of the Court's cooperation with national audit bodies and allowed the Court to form a chamber structure.
Since its establishment, the Court has consistently promoted cooperation with the Member States' Supreme Audit Institutions in the audit of EU funds, in particular through its participation in the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the EU-ORKB.
In its role as SAIs, the Court also sought to help shape developments in the field of public sector audit by working with other SAIs in the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and its EUROSAI regional group to establish technical standards and best practices.
The Court was well-known as an instrument for the development and dissemination of best practices within the SAIs Community early on on on the peer review procedure.
During its 35th anniversary, the Court sought to contribute to the improvement of EU financial management by presenting high-quality products reflecting developments in the EU and the changing needs of its users.
Over the past 35 years, the EU has introduced new Member States, gained new powers and created new institutions at EU level – all of which had to be taken into account by the Court in its work.
As a result, the Court's output has increased significantly compared with the two opinions it issued in the first year of its activity.
The Court's products today include annual reports, special reports, statements of assurance, special annual reports, opinions and position papers.
The number of outputs has increased to 87 publications in 2012.
For several years, the Court has given a higher priority to examining the results achieved in the implementation of EU policies and to providing guidance to improve economic efficiency.
Like the EU, the Court has developed.
Based on nine members and 120 employees in 1977, the Court now has 27 members and almost 900 employees.
Like the Union itself, the Court's success depends on close cooperation between members and staff from all European countries.
The Court is proud that since 1977 it has been able to build up a dedicated, professional and experienced staff that is committed to protecting the financial interests of citizens.
In the coming years, the Court will devote itself to contributing to improving accountability for the resources allocated to meeting the objectives towards citizens.

Foreword by President 04 Dear reader, 2014 was a year of profound change for the EU and its finances.
The EU entrusted the European Central Bank with the responsibility for overseeing the large banks in the euro area.
It was the first year of the new multiannual financial framework, which was relevant for the implementation of the EU budget for the period 2014-2020.
The new elections of Members of the European Parliament and the replacement of the top positions in the Council and the European Commission were also of particular importance. The European Court of Auditors (EuRH) also welcomed six new members.
In 2014, our institution produced 91 reports, opinions and other products – more than ever before.
They are the result of our audits of accounting, compliance audits and cost-effectiveness audits, including the audits that fall within the scope of our new responsibilities with regard to financial and economic governance.
They contain many important findings, conclusions and recommendations to improve the financial management and accountability of the EU in the 2014-2020 programming period.
Some of its key messages are set out in this annual activity report.
We also aim to provide our audience with the most comprehensive possible knowledge, based on our audit experience, of the main challenges facing the EU in the financing and implementation of its policies.
To this end, and as a contribution to this period of innovation, we introduced a new product in 2014, the so-called "Landscape" analyses.
In addition, at the request of the European Parliament, we have published an overview of the results of our audits of the accounts and compliance procedures in the areas of agricultural and cohesion expenditure for the period 2009-2013.
The Court also works closely with its addressees to ensure that the addressees can make the best use of the results of its work.
Among other things, the Court designated in 2014 a member responsible for institutional relations and a speaker.
It also organised several events to provide a forum for exchanges with high-level stakeholders from the EU and the Member States.
The conference brought together a large number of persons responsible for managing and controlling EU funds, including Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission, Supreme Audit Institutions and representatives of science.
The Vice-President of the European Parliament and former EU Commissioner Olli Rehn gave an introductory speech.
The visit of a delegation of Court members to Lithuania, where meetings were held with Members of Parliament, members of the government and representatives of the National Court of Auditors and the Lithuanian Central Bank, should also be highlighted.
Foreword of President 05 Throughout the year, our 2013-2017 strategy was groundbreaking for our work and the actions taken to reform our institution.
In 2014, we shortened the average time needed to produce our special reports and reduced the number of our staff, as required by an interinstitutional agreement.
We also set the fundamen for future efficiency and effectiveness gains by launching an internal reform project.
This project coordinates the implementation of the recommendations of internal working groups and the recommendations of the independent, external peer review on the practice of our economic impact assessment and the European Parliament's report on the future role of the Court.
The Court is based in Luxembourg, but our test teams travel wherever EU funds are spent as part of their audit work.
This activity report provides an overview of the audit visits and the reports we have produced.
A special highlight will be given to our examination of EU support for European airport infrastructure.
It is a clear example of our economic audits to assess the impact and added value of EU funding and highlights the efforts the Court has made in fulfilling its mandate.
This audit also demonstrates the commitment and professionalism of the Court's staff, whose expertise and commitment the Court and its citizens, in the interests of which it acts, can always rely.
Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira President
2014 at a glance 06 Our activities • Annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds for the financial year 2013. • 51 special annual reports on the various agencies, decentralised bodies and joint enterprises of the EU for the financial year 2013 and two summary reports. • 24 special reports on certain budgetary or management issues ranging from European banking supervision to EU-funded airport infrastructures. • 7 opinions and other statements with contributions on financial management issues, from the reform of the EU's own resources system to an investigation into possible savings by pooling the European Parliament's activities in a single place. • Two landscape analyses: one on accountability and public financial control requirements in the EU, and another on risks to EU financial management. • Organisation of a high-level conference on accountability and public financial control in the EU. • Orientation of the meeting of the contact committee of the Presidents of the Court of Auditors with a focus on strengthening of the Member States' financial management.
Our management • The court welcomed six new members in 2014: Alex Brenninkmeijer, Danièle Lamarque, Nikolaos Milionis, Phil Wynn Owen, Klaus‐Heiner Lehne and Oskar Herics.
The College of Members elected by Vítor Caldeira again as President of the Court for a third three-year period and appointed Ville Itälä as the member responsible for institutional relations. • The Court's 2013-2017 strategy provided impetus for changes in the organisation: the Court introduced an internal reform project aimed at streamlining the audit process and ensuring a more flexible organisation of resources. • Further improvement of administrative efficiency, based on procedural simplifications and the relocation of staff working in support services to the audit area.
An action plan on equal opportunities has also been implemented.
Building of the Court in Luxembourg.
Our activities 07 Audit reports and other products The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are: • Annual reports – with the results of its audits of the accounts and compliance audits of the budget of the European Union and the European Development Funds (EDF).
In addition, special annual reports on EU agencies, decentralised bodies and Joint Undertakings have been published separately. • Special reports – which can be published at any time during the year, with the results of its selected audits on specific budgetary areas or management issues.
These are essentially economic audits. • Opinions – on new or amended legal acts affecting the financial management and other analytical products drawn up either at the request of another institution or at the Court's own initiative.
In 2014, the farm produced more products than ever before, and also presented new products.
Many analytical information can still be found in the annual reports, and they also provide a comprehensive presentation of the results of our annual audits of accounting and compliance audits.
In 2014, a greater focus was placed on economic audits so that additional information on the quality of the implementation of the EU budget plan was made available to the EU budgetary authority.
In addition to the annual reports, we published for the first time a summary of our audit results on agricultural and cohesion expenditure under shared management during the period 2009-2013 in order to provide a multiannual perspective.
The other important development was a new product called Landscape Analysis.
In landscape ana-lysis, information and analyses on key issues will be presented on the basis of our expertise in the audit area.
In 2014, we published two Landscape analyses: the first focuses on the main challenges facing the EU in terms of accountability and public financial control; the second focuses on the risks to EU financial management.

Our activities 08 audit visits in 2014 While most of the audit work is carried out at our premises in Luxembourg, our auditors also carry out audit visits to the authorities of the Member States, to other recipients of EU funds (including at the headquarters of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation in Switzerland) and to the EU agencies and bodies.
The purpose of these visits is to obtain direct audit evidence from the bodies involved in the authorisation, management and disbursement of EU funds, as well as from the respective final recipients.
Our audit teams usually consist of two to three auditors, and the duration of a test visit is up to two weeks, depending on the type of test and the distance.
Within the EU, our audit visits are often carried out in coordination with the Supreme Audit Authorities of the Member States visited.
The frequency and intensity of audit work in individual Member States and beneficiary countries depend on the type of audit and the results of the sample selection.
Therefore, the number and duration of the verification visits may vary from country to country and year to year.
In 2014, the Court's auditors spent 4 915 days on-the-spot audits – in Member States and outside the EU – and obtained audit evidence for the annual reports and the selected audit tasks (Son-the-Reports).
They also spent some time with the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as with the decentralised agencies and bodies throughout the EU.
In 2014, our auditors used fewer days on-site than in previous years.
This is due to more efficient working methods and an increasing use of technologies such as videoconferencing.
EU inspectors used EU inspectors to test installations for maritime freight transport.

Our activities 10 Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013 The Court devoted most of its audits to the accounts and compliance audits during 2014 to the implementation of the EU budget for 2013.
The 2013 Annual Report from this work was published on 5 November 2014 and presented to our audience, including the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the EU (Economy and Finance), national parliaments and governments, as well as the media.
The aim of the annual report is to help the European Parliament, the Council and citizens to assess the quality of EU financial management by presenting findings and conclusions.
The core element of the 2013 annual report is the 20th Annual Statement of Assurance (DAS) on the reliability of EU accounts and the regularity of the underlying transactions.
That report provided more information on the cost-effectiveness of EU expenditure and on the Commission's performance reporting.
Estimated error rate for the EU budget: 4.7% President Caldeira at the handing over of the annual report for the financial year 2013 to the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz.
Our activities 11 The key statements of the 2013 Annual Report ο The Court has issued a full audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts of the European Union for 2013.
Total revenue for 2013 was lawful and proper, including commitments. ο Payments for 2013 were substantially affected by errors.
Therefore, the Court has given a failed opinion on its legality and regularity.
This figure is close to the 2012 error rate (4.8%) and consistently above the 2 % materiality threshold. ο The two spending areas were most wrongly regional policy, transport and energy with an estimated error rate of 6.9% and rural development, environment, fisheries and health with an estimated error rate of 6.7%.
In the case of shared management as a whole, the estimated error rate was 5.2%. ο Overall, the monitoring and control systems examined, with significant differences between Member States, ensured the regularity of payments with a conditional effect.
As in 2012, the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the errors in a large proportion of the error-related operations in the areas of shared management before the Commission was requested to reimburse them. ο Corrective measures and recoveries by the Member States' authorities and the Commission had a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
Without these measures, the estimated overall unemployment rate would have been 6.3%. ο In the use of EU funds, absorption (use it or lose it – lapse in non-use) and compliance with legislation and not good performance were at the forefront of the 2007-2013 programming period.
This lack of focus on performance is a crucial weakness in the way a large part of the EU budget is built.

Our activities 13 Agriculture and Cohesion: Overview of EU expenditure during the period 2007-2013 In parallel with the annual reports, the Court published a background document for the first time – in 23 official EU languages – in order to provide a multiannual perspective on the findings underlying the Statement of Assurance in the two main areas of agriculture and cohesion.
It drew lessons on issues encountered in EU financial management and control over the past period of expenditure, summarised audit results and identified challenges related to the new 2014-2020 period.
In addition, it was in line with the European Parliament's wish to obtain country-specific information on shared management.The key points: ο Except for direct aid and market support measures for farmers in the agricultural sector, the pressure to use funds is a key aspect of the risk of shared management expenditure. ο The main risks to the regularity of agricultural expenditure are that the areas or animals or the costs on which aid payments are based are not eligible, the beneficiaries of aid do not meet the conditions and the aid is not calculated correctly.
Infringements of agri-environmental requirements, specific requirements for investment projects and procurement rules are important factors that increase the risk of rural development expenditure. ο The greatest risk of cohesion expenditure is breach of EU and/or national public procurement rules.
The second biggest risk is that expenditure (or projects) is not eligible for EU funding. ο Although there is a significant need for improvement in control systems, the main challenge is to take action to simplify the management of programmes.
The Court notes errors in all EU Member States.
Many errors have occurred due to the complexity of the overall management and control architecture. ο Despite improvements in the reporting of risks and errors by the Member States' authorities, it is still very difficult for the Commission to ensure the reliability of this information. ο The amendments to the regulations for the new programming period may not have a significant impact on the level of risk.
Our activities 14 Annual Report on the European Development Funds for 2013 The European Development Funds (EDF) are financed by EU Member States, subject to their own financial regulation and managed outside the EU's general budget.
The European Commission is responsible for the financial management of operations financed from EDF resources.
Under the EDF, under the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, the European Union grants funds for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
Expenditure is aimed at reducing and ultimately defeating poverty, in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP States and OCTs into the world economy.
The agreement is based on three complementary pillars, namely development cooperation, economic and trade cooperation and the political dimension.
The Court's 2013 annual report on the EDF was published in parallel with the annual report on the EU budget on 5 November 2014.
It contains the 20th Statement of Assurance on EDFs.
The Court noted that the 2013 financial statements are appropriate to the assets and financial position of the EDFs, the results of their operations and cash flows and the changes in net assets as a whole.
The Court estimated the error rate in EDF expenditure operations for the financial year 2013 at 3.4 %, an increase of 3.0% compared to 2012.
Special annual reports on the financial year 2013 In 2014, the Court produced and published 51 special annual reports on the financial year 2013.
The reports covered 41 decentralised bodies, executive agencies and other EU bodies, the seven EU Joint Undertakings in the field of research, as well as the European Central Bank, the European Schools and the Sisnet communication infrastructure.
The Court also published two summaries with an overview of the results of its annual audits for the financial year 2013 – one on the EU agencies and other bodies, the second on the research community.
These two analytical and comparative summaries were submitted to the President of the European Parliament, the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, the General Affairs Council and the Council's Committee on Budgets.
Together with the special annual reports, these summaries are available on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu).
EU agencies, bodies and joint ventures are set up on the basis of EU legislation to carry out specific tasks, and their seats are located throughout the European Union.
They are active in many areas, such as security, health, research, finance, migration and travel.
They all have a mandate, a board of directors, a director, staff and a budget.
While the agencies, bodies and Joint Undertakings, in relation to the EU budget as a whole, have a relatively low financial risk, the Union's reputational risk is high, as it is clearly visible in the Member States and has a significant impact on policy design, decision-making and programme implementation in areas of major importance to European citizens.
51 special annual reports during the year
Our activities 15 The Court gave the 41 agencies and other entities full audit opinions on the reliability of the 2013 accounts.
The transactions underlying these financial statements were legal and orderly for all agencies and other bodies except for two in all essential matters. For the EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) and Frontex (European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union), the Court issued limited audit opinions.
In addition, the 2013 accounts were reliable for all seven Joint Undertakings, but the Court gave a limited audit opinion for three Joint Undertakings on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying their annual accounts: Artemis (embedded ICT systems), ENIAC (nanoelectronics) and IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative).
With regard to the European Schools, the Court was unable to conclude whether the consolidated annual accounts for 2013 were free from material misrepresentations, as the schools still lack accounting and control.
The Court examined the management of the European Central Bank's carbon footprint and noted that while the Bank has taken measures to reduce the negative impact of its management on the environment, further efforts and measures are needed.
Special reports adopted in 2014 In addition to its annual reports and special annual reports, the Court publishes special reports throughout the year containing the results of its economic and compliance audits on specific budgetary areas or management issues of its choice.
In the selection and design of these audit tasks, the Court is committed to achieving maximum impact and thus making the best use of its resources.
The Court takes account of the following factors in its selection of subjects: • the risks of irregularity or reduced economic viability in the expenditure or policy area; • the potential to achieve added value in the context of an audit carried out by the Court; • the political and public interest. 24 special reports in 2014
Our Activities 16 The main stages of a selected audit audit audit planning on-the-spot audit Preparation of the report Coordination of the report Adoption Publication Determination of the expeditability and feasibility of a proposed audit; definition of the scope, objectives, approach, methods and timing of the audit Multi-disciplinary teams will carry together on-the-spot audit evidence in the Commission's central services and in Member States and beneficiary countries Clear, structured presentation of the main findings and conclusions; preparation of recommendations Confirmation of the facts and findings by the audited bodies Adoption of the report by the audit chamber or the entire Court College Publication of the special report in 23 official languages together with the audited opinion On the following pages, the topics of the 24 special reports prepared by the Court in 2014 will be briefly presented, each under the relevant headings of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, the EU's multiannual budget.
Our activities 17 Smart and inclusive growth Smart and inclusive growth covers two areas: competitiveness for growth and jobs includes resources for research and innovation, education and training, trans-European energy, transport and telecommunications networks, social policy, enterprise development, etc. The EU's funding for growth and jobs for the period 2014-2020, at current prices, is EUR 142 billion and 13% of the total EU budget.
Economic, social and territorial cohesion includes regional policy, which aims to help the most developed countries and regions of the EU to join the rest, strengthening the competitiveness of all regions and developing cooperation between them.
The EU budget for cohesion for the period 2014-2020, at current prices, is EUR 367 billion and 34% of the total EU budget.
In 2014, the Court produced the following special reports in this area: • Effectiveness of EU-funded projects in the field of public transport (No 1/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed the implementation and effectiveness of projects in the field of public transport co-financed by EU Structural Funds in order to determine whether the projects met users' needs and achieved their objectives.
The audit showed that two thirds of the EU Structural Funds co-financed local transport projects have been used insufficiently.
This development was primarily caused by weaknesses in project design and inadequate mobility policies.
However, this insufficient performance has generally not been followed up by the promoters or the national authorities.
Infrastructure and rolling stock have generally been established for most projects in line with project specifications.
Significant delays and cost overruns have been identified, but after completion almost all of the audited projects were in line with users' needs.
European cities must improve mobility and reduce congestion, accidents and pollution through local mobility strategies.
The co-financed projects helped cities to establish urban transport systems such as metros, trams and buses.
Trams and buses are important means of transport for public transport.
Our activities 18 • Has the funds from the Cohesion Policy Funds been used to promote renewable energy production achieved good results?
(No 6/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the two main sources of funding for the promotion of renewable energies – the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) – had achieved good results. To this end, it was examined whether the funds had been allocated appropriately prioritised, cost-effective and mature renewable energy production projects to achieve meaningful objectives, and to what extent these funds have achieved good results that have contributed to the achievement of the EU 2020 renewable energy target.
The audit found that improvements were needed to ensure that EU funding made the greatest possible contribution to achieving the objective.
The projects audited provided the outputs as planned and most of the projects were sufficiently mature and ready to be implemented at the time they were selected.
There were no significant cost overruns or major delays, and renewable energy production capacities were installed as planned and were operational as planned.
However, the results relating to energy production have not always been achieved or measured properly.
Overall, the use of funds was only limited in efficiency, as cost-effectiveness in the planning and implementation of projects was not the guiding principle and expenditure had a limited EU added value.
The EU Council has set a binding EU target of 20% for the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020.
In the period 2007-2013, some 4.7 million euros were made available for renewable energy from the ERDF and the CF. • Was the ERDF successful in supporting the development of incubators?
(No 7/2014) – In this special report, the Court analysed whether the incubators co-financed by the ERDF had successfully supported start-up companies with high growth potential.
The audit found that the EU has made a significant financial contribution to the creation of incubators' infrastructure, particularly in Member States where this type of business support is relatively rare.
However, the performance of the audited incubators left much to be desired.
The provision of startup-related services was rather limited due to financial constraints and the small size of start-up-related activities.
This situation was mainly due to a lack of expertise on start-up support procedures and poor management systems.
Incubators pursue the goal of supporting new companies in their successful establishment and further development.
Support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has thus become an increasingly political priority over time.
EU spending in this area amounted to EUR 38 billion in the period 2007-2013.
The "Delta" building in the Wrocław Technology Park, co-financed by the ERDF.
Our activities 19 • Is the ERDF effective in financing projects directly promoting biodiversity under the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2020?
(No 12/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the ERDF funding available for the direct promotion of biodiversity has been used by Member States.
The audit showed that Member States are lagging behind in the use of ERDF funding to finance projects compared to other ERDF spending areas.
In order to ensure that the ERDF can continue to be useful for the implementation of the EU biodiversity reduction strategy by 2020, the Commission should provide more support to Member States in implementing specific conservation and management plans for natural habitats and species.
The co-financed projects were generally in line with the biodiversity priorities set at national and EU level.
However, the assessment of the effectiveness of these projects was hampered by the fact that most Member States did not include results indicators or monitoring systems to assess the development of natural habitats and species.
The protection of biodiversity is one of the EU's most important priorities.
After missing the previous target of mitigating the loss of biodiversity in Europe by 2010, the Council approved a new strategy for 2020. Direct support for biodiversity and nature conservation was allocated EUR 2.8 billion in ERDF funding during the 2007-2013 programming period. • Has ERDF support for SMEs in the field of e-commerce been effective?
(No 20/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether operational programmes provided a good basis for effective support for e-commerce actions for SMEs, whether managing authorities properly selected and monitored e-commerce projects and whether the e-commerce projects co-financed by the ERDF have been successfully implemented and have provided measurable benefits.
The Court noted that ERDF support for SMEs in the field of e-commerce – purchasing and selling goods via the Internet – helped to increase the online availability of business services.
However, due to monitoring deficits, it was impossible to assess the extent to which ERDF support has contributed to the achievement of the IT objectives of the Member States and the EU.
Insufficient selection procedures by Member States mean that a good cost-benefit ratio is unlikely for many projects.
The programme managers focused more on the use of resources (outputs) than on achieving results.
The Commission is supporting e-commerce through its Digi-tal Agenda for Europe. In the framework of the ERDF budget, EUR 3 billion of EU funding was allocated to improve the use of ICT by SMEs in the period 2007-2013.

Our activities 20 Close-up of an economic assessment: EU-funded airport infrastructures – insufficient cost-benefit ratio (No. 21/2014) Closed part of the oversized terminal at Fuerteventura Airport.
Although EU aviation policy aims to overcome capacity problems by building additional infrastructure, making better use of existing structures, optimising airport services and improving connections to other modes of transport, Europe will not be able to meet much of this demand because of the lack of runways and ground infrastructure.
In Europe, there are more than 500 airports where one million people are employed directly or indirectly and, together with the airlines, they contribute more than EUR 140 billion to Europe's economic performance.
Airport-related infrastructure projects are an important part of the EU budget: projects of this nature allocated the EU some EUR 4.5 billion in the programming periods 2000-2013, of which more than EUR 2.8 billion was made available from the Cohesion Policy Funds.
As part of its assessment of this support, the Court examined whether the investment was clearly needed, whether the respective time and cost frameworks were respected in the construction projects and whether the newly built or modernised infrastructure was fully used.
The Court assessed whether the investments led to higher passenger numbers and improved customer service and whether the airports supported were financially viable.
The auditors carried out their work between May 2013 and October 2014, with a focus on 20 EU-funded airports in Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain.
Overall, more than EUR 600 million has been allocated to these airports for the period 2000-2013.
The team carried out an audit of relevant legislation, air traffic planning in the five Member States and publications of the main interbranch organisations.
In particular, the auditors visited the 20 airports in order to assess and obtain direct evidence of the outputs, uses, results and impacts of EU funds and the economic situation of the airports.
The Court concluded that the cost-benefit ratio of EU-funded investments for airports was not right.
Too many airports, often close together, received financial support for similar infrastructure, and in many cases it turned out that these infrastructures were oversized.
Only half of the airports audited managed to increase their passenger numbers.
Improvements in customer service or regional socio-economic benefits, such as the creation of additional jobs, were neither measured nor documented.
The investigation also showed that seven of the airports were not financially self-supporting and would have difficulties in operating without further public support.
At most of the airports audited, the audit team found significant delays in the construction and provision of infrastructure.
At almost half of airports, costs were exceeded, so that Member States had to contribute almost 100 million euros more from their national budgets than originally planned.
Our activities 21 The financing was not well coordinated by the Member States: in most countries there was no strategic long-term airport development plan.
In addition, the Commission has insufficiently monitored the financing, which is generally not known which airports receive funding or what amounts are involved.
As a result, it does not have a full picture of all EU airport investment and has limited possibilities to monitor and ensure that strategies are properly designed and implemented.
On the basis of these findings, the Court recommended that the Commission should, from the 2014-2020 programming period onwards, ensure that Member States only use EU funds for infrastructure at airports that are financially viable and whose investment needs have been adequately assessed and demonstrated.
Another recommendation was that Member States should have coherent plans for airport expansion at regional, national and supranational level in order to avoid overcapacity, duplication and uncoordinated investment in airport infrastructure.
In its reply, the Commission confirmed that lessons have been learned from these experiences.
As a result, it has ensured that a fundamentally different approach is applied in the relevant legislation for the 2014-2020 programming period.
The report was presented to the European Parliament, which fully supports the Court's conclusions and recommendations.
The publication of the report attracted considerable media interest.
The media reaction was greatest in Spain, but also included headlines in major international newspapers, television coverage and social media.

Our activities 22 Sustainable growth: natural resources The EU has a high political responsibility in the fields of agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for the period 2014-2020, at current prices, amounts to EUR 420 billion and 39 % of the EU budget as a whole.
Three quarters of the expenditure concerns direct payments to farmers and support to agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) – the ‘first pillar' of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
Another fifth of the expenditure is EU support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the "second pillar" of the CAP.
Agriculture and rural development are subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States.
In 2014, the Court produced the following special reports in this area: • Integration of the objectives of EU water policy into the CAP: a partial success (No 4/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the objectives of EU water policy were successfully integrated into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
The audit showed that the EU can only achieve partial success in integrating the objectives of water policy into the CAP.
The two instruments for integrating water-related issues (cross compliance and rural development) have shortcomings and the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is characterised by delays and weaknesses.
The CAP instruments have so far had a positive impact on supporting the policy objectives of improving water quantity and quality.
However, these instruments are limited compared to the ambitious objectives of the CAP.
For example, neither of these two instruments allows the full application of the "polluter pays" principle in the allocation of CAP funds.
Furthermore, it is not sufficiently known at the level of the EU institutions and in the Member States how much water resources are exposed to agricultural activities, and what developments these pressures are.
The EU gives high priority to the protection of European water resources.
Agriculture, one of the largest consumers and polluters of water resources, plays a key role in sustainable water management.
For the CAP, almost 40% of the EU budget (more than EUR 50 billion for 2014) is raised, and the EU is working under the CAP to influence the agricultural practices that have an impact on water resources.
Our activities 23 • Has the Commission managed effectively the integration of coupled support into the single payment scheme?
(No 8/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed how well the Commission managed, after the CAP health check carried out in 2008, to include EU support linked to production volumes (e.g. farmed areas or livestock numbers) in the single payment scheme.
The audit revealed that the Commission did not adequately monitor in the 2010-2012 period how Member States calculated farmers' entitlements to EU support payments for agricultural holdings under the farm payment scheme.
While most Member States had correctly used the reference data of farmers, there were serious deficiencies in the correct application of the calculation rules and principles.
The Commission did not use its mandate to ensure that the criteria for allocating available support were always in line with the EU principles, that they complied with the principle of sound budgetary management and that they had no potential impact on market conditions.
The Commission's framework did not provide sufficiently clear rules on which Member States should carry out controls and Member States' control systems were of varying quality.The main objective of the single payment scheme was to shift the focus of the CAP from market support to decoupled income support for farmers: farmers should be able to adapt their production to market demand and their income should be stabilised.
The single payment scheme introduced to date in 18 Member States accounts for 54% of the total EU budget for agriculture and rural development. • Is EU support for investment and promotion in the wine sector well managed and is there evidence of results in terms of the competitiveness of EU wines?
(No 9/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the investment and promotion measures were properly designed and examined the available monitoring and evaluation data in order to assess whether the Commission and the Member States achieved the desired results in an efficient manner.
The audit found that the management of support for investment and promotion in the wine sector was hampered by design and implementation shortcomings, and that the impact on the competitiveness of EU wines could not always be demonstrated.
The specific investment measure for the wine sector is not justified as support is already provided under EU rural development policy.
EU support for the promotion of wines has often served to consolidate existing markets rather than to open up new or reconquer old markets.
The impact of the investment measure cannot easily be separated from the investment in rural development.
The EU is the world's largest wine producer.
EU support should improve competitiveness and ensure a better balance between supply and demand.
Member States spent EUR 522 million on the promotion measure and EUR 518 million on the investment measure during the period 2009-2013.
For 2014-2018, the appropriations allocated to the Member States under this measure have increased significantly.
Our activities 24 • Effectiveness of support for aquaculture provided by the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) (No 10/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the measures to support aquaculture were well designed and adequately implemented at EU and Member State level and whether the EFF has provided an adequate cost-benefit ratio and supported the sustainable development of aquaculture.
The audit found that the measures to support aquaculture by 2013 were not well designed and implemented at EU and Member State level, that the EFF did not achieve an adequate cost-benefit ratio and that the sustainable development of aquaculture was not supported effectively.
The current framework was not suitable for concrete implementation of the EU's objectives for the sustainable development of aquaculture and the results were insufficient.
The measures to support the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Member States were not well designed and implemented.
The national strategic plans and operational programmes of the Member States were not sufficiently clear and the Member States did not have a coherent strategy for the sector.
The EFF funding has often not been sufficiently targeted for aquaculture projects and the audit has shown that these projects generally did not deliver the planned results or a good cost-benefit ratio.
Aquaculture produces around 1.3 million tonnes of fish every year in the EU, with sales of EUR 4 billion.
One of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for the period up to 2013 was to promote the sustainable development of aquaculture.
By May 2013, the EFF provided more than EUR 400 million to finance measures to promote productive investment and environmental and health policies in the aquaculture sector. • Economic efficiency: keeping control of the costs of EU-funded aid for rural development projects (No 22/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the approaches taken by the Commission and Member States were the most effective to keep the costs of rural development aid under control.
The audit showed that EU Member States could achieve significant savings in aid to rural development projects while at the same time enabling a more efficient use of resources.
The auditors identified viable and cost-effective approaches that could be more widely used in Member States' control of the costs of rural development aid.
The Member States' control systems were designed to monitor the prices of goods or works mentioned in the aid applications without equal consideration being given to the question of whether the goods themselves were appropriate.
Some price controls were time consuming or provided little certainty that the approved costs were reasonable.
At the beginning of the programming period, the Commission did not provide sufficient guidance and did not ensure the dissemination of recommended procedures.
It did not ensure that the systems of the Member States were effective, and that they had a large share of the aid granted.
Around half of the EU's rural development expenditure for the period 2007-2013, totalling EUR 100 billion, has been implemented in the form of grants to cover the costs of investment projects and other projects carried out by farmers, agricultural enterprises, associations and local authorities.
Our activities 25 • Errors in rural development expenditure: what are the causes and what is being done to eliminate them?
(No 23/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined compliance with existing laws and other legislation on the implementation of rural development and described the main causes of the high error rate in this area.
The audit found that most of the errors in rural development policy were due to non-compliance with conditions established at Member State level.
The control authorities of the Member States could and should have been able to detect and correct most of the errors in investment in rural development.
Member States' control systems are flawed as controls are not comprehensive and are based on insufficient information.
The average error rate for rural development expenditure over the last three years was 8.2 %.
Errors in investment measures accounted for two-thirds of the error rate, and area-related aid accounted for one-third.
Only 16% of the error rate was due to non-compliance with provisions directly contained in EU regulations, while the largest share of the burden ratio – 84% – was due to non-compliance with conditions established at Member State level.
The EU and the Member States allocated over EUR 150 billion for rural development policy in the 2007-2013 programming period, which was almost equally used for investment and land-based aid.
These expenditures are particularly flawed. • Is EU aid well managed to prevent and remedy forest damage caused by fires and natural disasters?
(No 24/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the support measure of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for the reconstruction of forestry potential and the implementation of preventive actions (measure 226) was well managed and whether the Commission and the Member States could demonstrate that the objectives of the aid were achieved in a cost-effective manner.
The audit showed that the EU's funding for the prevention of forest fires and the restoration of forests damaged by natural disasters and fires was not well managed enough.
The Commission and the Member States cannot demonstrate that the results of the funding have been achieved in a cost-effective way.
Over the last 30 years, an average of 480 000 hectares of forest in the EU have been destroyed each year by fires.
Preventive actions accounted for more than 80% of EU funding of 1.5 billion euros for the period 2007-2013.
Our activities 26 Security and Citizenship This policy area has been established to ensure the free movement of persons and provide citizens with a high level of protection.
It ranges from the administration of the EU's external borders to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and includes asylum and immigration policies, police cooperation and the fight against crime.
Expenditure in this area for the period 2014-2020 is expected to be 18 million euro or less than 2% of the total budget.
In 2014, the Court produced the following special reports in this area: • Findings from the European Commission's development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (No. 3/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined why the Commission provided SIS II more than six years later than planned and incurred eight times more costs than originally estimated.
It was assessed whether there was a viable business case for SIS II throughout the duration of the project, taking into account major changes in costs and expected benefits.
The audit found that the delays and excessive costs were due to weaknesses in management by the Commission.
The initial deadline was unrealistic and the Commission was unable to effectively manage the main task for development before 2009.
The initial cost estimates significantly underestimated the actual level of investment required.
The total cost of SIS II was EUR 189 million, compared to an initial estimated amount of EUR 23 million.
The Commission did not fully demonstrate that SIS II provided it with the best cost-benefit ratio.
However, it has learned from its experience during the first phase of the project and has already used some of these findings for other large-scale IT projects.
The Schengen Information System is used by border protection, police, customs, visa and judicial authorities throughout the Schengen area.
It contains information (an alert) on persons who may have been involved in a serious crime or who do not have the right to enter or reside in the EU.
It also includes calls for tenders relating to missing persons and lost or stolen property. • The External Borders Fund contributed to more financial solidarity, but the outcome measurement needs to be improved and additional EU added value created (No 15/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed the effectiveness and EU added value of the External Borders Fund and highlighted the extent to which the objectives of the co-funded projects and programmes have been achieved.
The audit showed that the External Borders Fund contributed to the management of the external borders of the EU and increased financial solidarity between Member States.
However, its additional EU added value was limited and the overall results could not be measured due to weaknesses in the monitoring by the competent authorities and serious shortcomings in the evaluations carried out at Commission and Member State level.
Member States' programmes were not embedded in national border control and visa policies and did not contain SMART targets or measurable indicators.
The project selection procedures did not ensure that the actual needs of the Member States were met.
Unfinished procurement procedures in the Member States pose a risk to the sound management of the budget.
In the predominantly affected Member States (Greece, Spain, Italy and also Malta in the first years of support), there were major weaknesses in the management of the Fund.
The EU's main financial instrument to support the management of external borders was the External Borders Fund, which provided EUR 1.9 billion for the period 2007-2013.
Its overarching objective was to support current and future Schengen States in ensuring uniform, effective and efficient controls at their common external borders.
Our activities 27 Europe in the world The EU's external relations activities focus on enlargement, achieving stability, security and prosperity in its neighbourhood, active support for sustainable development at international level, promoting global political governance and ensuring strategic and civil security.
The EU has allocated €66 billion, at current prices, or 6% of its total planned expenditure for the period 2014-2020, to these objectives.
Expenditure is largely managed directly by the Commission through its central services or delegations.
In 2014, the Court produced the following special reports in this area: • The establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) (No 11/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the establishment of the EEAS has been adequately prepared, whether its resources have been efficiently prioritised, organised and allocated, and whether it has effectively coordinated with the Commission and the Member States.
The audit noted that the EEAS should increase its efficiency and do more for the EU and its citizens.
The establishment of the EEAS has been hastily and has not been prepared well enough.
Inefficiencies in prioritisation, organisation and allocation of resources reduced its efficiency.
Coordination between the EEAS and the Commission was only partially effective, mainly due to the lack of effective coordination mechanisms and a rigid financial and administrative framework at the level of delegation.
Coordination with Member States can be further developed to exploit synergies in the area of information exchange or joint accommodation and to improve consular services, including the protection of EU citizens.
The EEAS has its headquarters in Brussels and a global network of 140 delegations.
For 2014, the EEAS had a budget of EUR 519 million, divided between the Headquarters (41%) and delegations (59%). • EU rehabilitation assistance following the earthquake in Haiti (No 13/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the EU's state-of-the-art rehabilitation assistance to the country was well designed and adequately implemented, and whether the Commission provided an adequate link between emergency aid and rehabilitation and development measures.
The audit found that the EU's rehabilitation assistance after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti was overall well designed and geared to the country's urgent needs, but that the programmes were not implemented effectively enough and that emergency aid, rehabilitation and development were not sufficiently linked.
For most of the reviewed programmes, output was delivered on schedule or expected to be delivered, despite delays in almost all programmes.
While the Commission was aware of the difficult situation, it did not sufficiently account for some of the major risks that jeopardised the implementation and achievement of the programme's objectives.
The programmes were monitored, but the Commission and the EEAS did not take timely action to increase the resources of the EU Delegation in Haiti.
In March 2010, 55 donors pledged $5.4 billion for 2010-2012 in favour of rehabilitation and development and another $3.0 billion for 2013 and beyond.
The EU was one of the most important donors with the commitment of a single amount of EUR 1.2 billion.
Our activities 28 • Effectiveness of combining financial aid from regional investment facilities with loans (mixed financing) granted by financial institutions to support EU foreign policy (No 16/2014) – This special report addressed the establishment and management of the investment facilities and examined whether mixed financing had achieved the desired benefits.
In the context of the audit, the judgment on mixed financing, i.e. the combination of financial assistance from regional investment facilities with loans granted by financial institutions in support of EU foreign policy in terms of structure and overall effectiveness, was positive, but the Court also points to some key issues that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
Although the facilities were well-structured, the potential benefits of mixed financing were not fully realised by the Commission due to shortcomings in its management.
Almost half of the projects examined did not provide sufficient evidence that the grants were justified.
In some cases, investments would probably have been made without the EU contribution.
The Commission should ensure that the allocation of funds is based on a thorough, documented assessment of added value in terms of achieving the objectives of the EU's development, neighbourhood and enlargement policies.
Since 2007, the Commission has created eight regional investment facilities.
These combine financial assistance from the EDF and the EU's overall budget with loans mainly from European development finance institutions.
Mixed financing is usually aimed at exploiting investment opportunities in the form of large infrastructure projects that could be financially viable but for which sufficient resources cannot be mobilised in financial markets. • Can the EU Initiative of Centres of Excellence contribute effectively to the containment of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks originating outside the EU?
(No 17/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the initiative was based on a sound analysis of the situation existing before 2010, whether the organisational structure of the initiative was appropriate to meet the identified challenges and whether there was an appropriate administrative system and whether it was applied.
In the context of the audit, the Court had a generally positive view of the contribution of the Centres of Excellence to the reduction of CBRN risks.
The initiative is in line with the priorities set in the framework of the European Security Strategy and the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
It provides for the involvement of all stakeholders in the partner countries in order to improve the sustainability of the measures taken.
The organisational structure is generally appropriate, but its complexity contributed to the delay in the start-up of project activities.
The Centres of Excellence initiative is designed to establish regional platforms in different regions of the world to counteract CBRN risks.
It is the largest single measure of the long-term component of the Instrument for Stability and has been provided with a budget of EUR 100 million for the period 2010-2013.
Our activities 29 • EuropeAid for evaluation and results oriented monitoring (ROM) systems (No. 18/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether these systems are reliable, whether their structure and resource allocation are adequate, and whether they ensure that relevant and meaningful findings are made and that the findings are of maximum benefit.
In the context of the audit, the Court received a critical assessment of the reliability of these systems.
The evaluation and performance-oriented monitoring bodies are well organised, but more attention should be paid to the efficient use of resources.
The systems do not provide sufficient information on the results obtained and do not ensure that the findings are as good as possible.
The evaluations of projects and programmes organised by the Commission delegations and carried out in partner countries are not managed satisfactorily: overall monitoring is not appropriate, there is uncertainty about the level of resources used and there is a lack of access to the results.
Two key elements of the European Commission's framework on the accountability of the Directorate-General for Development and Cooperation (EuropeAid) are their systems set up for evaluation and results-oriented monitoring.
The total annual cost of the systems is estimated at 34 to 38 million euros.
The annual development expenditure covered by these systems is estimated to be around EUR 8 billion. • EU pre-accession assistance to Serbia (No 19/2014) – In this special report, the Court examined whether the Commission had effectively managed pre-accession assistance to Serbia in the period 2007-2013, assessing its support for the key area of governance.
Together with other forms of support, the resources provided by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) helped Serbia implement social and economic reforms and improve public financial management.
On the basis of its experience with other IPA beneficiary countries, the Commission is putting increasing emphasis on governance issues in the planning of financial and non-financial assistance for Serbia.
The Commission has effectively managed non-financial assistance to Serbia in the areas of governance and the fight against corruption.
As regards Serbia's preparations for the discreet management of EU funds, the Commission has also provided effective support, but only in the limited area of IPA administrative structures.
A quarter of the IPA funding for Serbia has been allocated to governance, which, according to the Commission, poses the biggest challenges for Serbia.
The EU complements IPA funding with a number of non-financial resources to help Serbia prepare for EU membership.
Our activities 30 Administration The administrative expenditure of the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies includes expenditure on staff (income and pensions) as well as on buildings, equipment, energy, communication and information technology.
The planned budget for the period 2014-2020 is – at current prices – EUR 70 million and 6% of the total EU budget.
In 2014, the Court adopted the following special report: • How do EU institutions and bodies calculate, reduce and compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions?
(No 14/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether EU institutions and bodies had strategies to reduce the impact of their administrative activities on the environment and whether these strategies had been effectively implemented.
In the report, the Court called on the EU institutions and bodies to develop a common policy approach to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 footprint).
The introduction of the environmental management and audit system is slow and the available information on the actual level of emissions is incomplete.
Few institutions and bodies systematically use environmental procurement.
While EU institutions and bodies have managed to reverse the trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption in their buildings, there were no clear trends in reducing emissions from other sources, such as missions, due to the available data.
More than half of the EU's audited institutions and bodies had not set any quantified targets for reducing their emissions.
EU environmental policy aims at a high level of protection.
The Treaty (TFEU) requires that environmental protection requirements be included in the definition and implementation of Union policies and measures to promote sustainable development.
Our activities 31 Revenue/own resources Own resources are the revenue of the EU which is used to finance its expenditure.
There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (the customs duties levied on imports from outside the EU and sugar production levies), own resources based on VAT and own resources derived from GNI (the largest source of revenue for the EU budget).
In 2014, the Court adopted the following special report in this area: • Will preferential trade arrangements be managed appropriately?
(No 2/2014) – In this special report, the Court assessed whether the Commission appropriately assessed the economic impact of preferential trade arrangements and whether controls effectively ensure that imports cannot wrongly be subject to preferential duties, resulting in a loss of EU revenue.
The audit showed that while the Commission has increased the quality of its impact assessments over time, the economic impact of preferential trade schemes remains insufficiently analysed.
The EU is evading revenues due to weaknesses in Member States' customs controls: these controls do not prevent certain imports from being wrongly subject to preferential customs duties.
Through unilateral preferential trade arrangements, the EU grants preferences to developing countries in order to provide them with duty-free access to the EU market and thus contribute to the eradication of poverty and to the promotion of sustainable development.
In 2011, the value of goods imported into the EU under preferential trade arrangements was more than EUR 242 billion, representing 14% of imports into the EU.
Our activities 32 Financial and economic governance The European Union's framework for economic governance aims to prevent or investigate and correct problematic economic developments, such as excessive government deficits or debt levels, which may hinder growth and expose the sustainability of public finances to risk.
In 2014, the Court adopted its first Special Report in this area: • European Banking Supervision is taking shape – EBA in a changing environment (No. 5/2014) – In this Special Report, the Court examined whether the Commission and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have exercised their responsibilities satisfactorily with a view to establishing new regulatory and supervisory regimes in the banking sector and how effective these rules have worked.
The audit showed that the Commission's lead reform of banking legislation and the establishment of EBA were the first major responses to the financial crisis.
EBA has laid the foundations for a new regulatory and supervisory system for the banking sector.
The identified weaknesses concerned cross-border banking supervision, the assessment of the resilience of EU banks and the promotion of consumer protection.
In the context of the implementation of the 2011 stress test, which was carried out at EU level without financial protection measures, the EBA had only a limited legal mandate and scarce human resources.
Although the stress test in 2011 resulted in the recapitalisation of numerous banks, it has also made it clear that such stress tests are restricted if they do not go hand in hand with the assessment of the quality of the overall assets.
Questions remain as to the future role of EBA in banking supervision and the respective roles and responsibilities of EBA and the ECB.
As a result of the financial crisis, the Commission has launched measures to stabilise the banking sector, aimed at strengthening the regulatory framework and banking supervision, particularly in cross-border banks.
In the course of the detailed proposals for regulatory changes, EBA was created in 2011.
EBA plays a role in the supervision of European banking regulation and consumer protection.
Our activities 33 Opinions and other statements adopted in 2014 The Court's opinions on proposals for new or amended acts with financial implications contribute to improving EU financial management.
These opinions are delivered at the request of the other EU institutions and used by the legislative authorities – the European Parliament and the Council – in their work.
The Court may also, on its own initiative, issue position papers and analyses on other issues.
At the Court's initiative, the European Court of Auditors' position on the Commission's report on the fight against corruption was presented, while the study on possible savings in the EU budget was carried out by pooling the European Parliament's activities in a single place at the request of the European Parliament.
7 comments in 2014
Our activities 34 Landscape analyses 2014 was marked by profound innovations for the European Union.
Against the background of this change, the Court has designed and created a new product: the Landscape Analysis.
Based on the Court's work results and its wealth of knowledge and experience, each analysis covers a wide range of topics.
The analyses will serve as a basis for consultation and dialogue with the Court's addressees and will help the Court to submit comments on important issues that are not subject to review.
The first Landscape Analysis published in September 2014 dealt with issues of EU accountability and public financial control rules (see box), which formed the most important basis for the EU accountability conference held in October 2014 (see page 42).
The second analysis, entitled "Using EU funds in an optimal way: a landscape analysis on the risks to EU financial management", was published in November 2014.
It provides an overview of the EU's financial flows and a summary of the issues to be addressed, inter alia, to ensure that EU taxpayers can be offered a better cost-benefit ratio with regard to the EU budget (see box).
The opinions and landscape analyses are available in full in 23 official EU languages on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu).
2 2 Landscape analyses in 2014
Our activities 35 gaps, overlaps and challenges: A landscape analysis of EU accountability and public financial control rules This landscape analysis aims to raise awareness of an issue that is of paramount importance for the democratic legitimacy of the EU's institutional system and to give impetus to these considerations.
It describes the key features of a framework for accountability, the role of public financial control, the key elements for a sound chain of accountability and financial control, as well as six important areas where challenges for accountability and public financial control exist at EU level, and analyses the accountability and financial control rules in relation to the various new EU and intergovernmental instruments developed in response to the financial crisis.
Making the most of EU funds: A Landscape Analysis on the Risks to EU Financial Management At a time when Member States' governments and taxpayers want greater benefits from the resources they contribute, this Landscape Analysis summarizes the Court's comments on all aspects of EU financial management.
Based on the Court's 35 years of experience in examining EU revenue and expenditure, this Landscape Analysis provides an overview of EU financial management and a summary of the issues to be addressed in order to ensure a better cost-benefit ratio with the EU budget.
This analysis is complemented by detailed data sheets on the main features and issues linked to the various areas of revenue and expenditure, and suggestions for improvements are made.
Our activities 36 The analysis identifies a number of key points that deserve particular attention: ο excessively complex eligibility schemes and other conditions for EU funding that make their understanding, management and control difficult and lead to different interpretations; ο rules and procedures for public procurement that are not always respected – either intentionally or because they are not properly understood – and thus lead to higher costs or delays in EU-financed projects; ο the insufficient capacity of national authorities to manage and disbursement EU funds that increases the risk of errors and the risk of low quality of expenditure; ο poor coordination of EU budget and national budgets; lack of co-financing by Member States; and a greater emphasis on compliance with the rules than achieving results; ο a high volume of commitments from the previous period of expenditure that still have to be financed from the EU budget.

Our activities 37 Relationships with the addressees The value of the Court's contribution to the EU's accountability obligation depends to a large extent on the benefits its key partners derive from its work and its products in the process of accountability.
These partners are the political bodies responsible for public oversight of the use of EU financial resources (i.e. the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and national parliaments).
Through its 2013-2017 strategy, the Court is required to step up arrangements to monitor external developments and to actively shape relations with its partners.
The President and the members of the Court shall maintain regular contacts with the committees of the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control.
In 2014, President Caldeira attended two meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and a number of plenary sessions of the European Parliament.
This included the presentation of the annual work programme and the annual reports.
Among the Court's strategic objectives is to strengthen partnerships with its main stakeholders, including the various specialised committees of the European Parliament and the Council.
In April 2014, Court Ville Itälä transferred the newly created function of the member responsible for institutional relations, which helped to strengthen our institution's relations with other EU institutions in a strategic way and to increase the opportunities for greater impact with our work.
In 2014, further Court members, in conjunction with the Court's annual reports and special reports, were speaking and responding to the Committee on Budgetary Control at 17 meetings 64 times.
The resulting discussions resulted in reports drawn up by individual members of the Committee on Budgetary Control on special Court reports, including a draft report on special reports related to the 2013 discharge procedure.
In 2014, the Committee on Budgetary Control started systematically inviting the specialised committees to the ideas of our special reports at its meetings, thus contributing to an increased impact of our work.
In early 2014, the European Parliament adopted a report on the future role of the European Court of Auditors.
The Court welcomed the view expressed in this report that any reform should be considered in the wider context of the challenge of improving EU accountability.
This applies in particular to the Court's work, its relations with the addressees and its use of resources.
The progress made on these issues was highlighted in the 2014 peer review report (see "Important events").
Our activities 38 In many cases, the Court has already launched a number of initiatives to improve the implementation of its 2013-2017 strategy, including streamlining the audit and reporting process, and a more flexible organisation of resources.
This resulted in more reports being produced during the year and the average time needed to do so was reduced.
Further efficiency gains and increased effectiveness of the audit process are expected from the internal reform project launched in 2014.
In a resolution adopted in November 2013, the European Parliament asked the Court to present a comprehensive analysis of the potential savings for the EU budget, which would arise if Parliament had a single seat, taking into account the savings resulting from the reduced loss of working time and greater efficiency.
The Court presented the outcome of this work in July 2014 and concluded that a move from Strasbourg to Brussels could lead to considerable savings, which were slightly higher due to an additional move from Luxembourg to Brussels.
In 2014, the Court continued regular cooperation with the Council in its various configurations and activities.
President Caldeira presented the annual reports to the ECOFIN Council in December 2014, and the Court was regularly invited to present special reports to the various Council committees and working groups.
Ensuring effective relations with national parliaments is another priority for the Court.
The committees of national parliaments responsible for European affairs and financial control are regularly informed of the Court's activities.
During the year, delegations from several national parliaments visited the Court, including the visit of a delegation from the French Senate in July 2014.
The Court also invited the main addressees to the annual seminar of its members in December 2014 to present their views on the challenges of accountability in the EU.
The Court is working with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to combat fraud in the wake of the EU budget.
It shall forward to OLAF any evidence of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity to the detriment of the EU's financial interests which it identifies in the course of its audit work or which is communicated to it by third parties.
In 2014, the Court informed OLAF of 16 cases in which fraud, corruption or illegal activities were suspected during the audit work.
Our activities 39 Cooperation with other Supreme Audit Institutions The Court is cooperating with other Supreme Audit Institutions (ORCBs) mainly in the following bodies: • Contact Committee of the SAIs of the EU Member States; • Network of the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries; • International organisations for public financial control bodies, in particular the International Organization of the Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
In September 2014, the Court revised and updated its international cooperation strategy (see box).
EUROSAI Congress, The Hague, June 2014.
Court's Strategy for International Cooperation The Court's Strategy for Cooperation, in line with its overarching 2013-2017 strategy, aims to make the greatest possible contribution to the EU's public accountability, in particular through enhanced bi- and multilateral cooperation with relevant partners such as national Supreme Audit Institutions and international audit organisations.
As the Court's audit obligations cover areas that are pan-European (e.g. fiscal governance) and global (e.g. climate change), our international cooperation activities are even more important than in the past.
The Court has the following priorities in its cooperation strategy: ο Cooperation at EU level within the Contact Committee and individual cooperation with the SAIs of the EU Member States will continue to be the main priorities.
This may include participation in joint audits and joint work in the area of accountability relevant to the EU budget and other EU policies. ο In the context of EU enlargement, the Court will continue to support the SAIs of candidate countries and potential candidate countries in their efforts to develop expertise. ο As a member of international audit organisations such as INTOSAI, the Court will increase its involvement in cooperation activities to define technical standards, as this organisation is of great importance for the development of expertise and for the exchange of knowledge in the public financial control sector.
Through its cooperation strategy, in conjunction with other recent actions, such as the newly established high-level conferences and meetings, the Court will help raise awareness of EU financial management and accountability.
Our activities 40 Contact Committee of the Supreme Audit Authorities of the EU Member States The European Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies are working with confidence, while respecting their independence, in accordance with the Treaty.
The Court actively cooperates with the SAIs of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee, including an annual meeting and the various working groups, networks and task forces set up to address specific issues of common interest.
In October 2013, the Court took over the chair of the Contact Committee for a year.
As chairman, the Court hosted the annual meeting of the Contact Committee, which took place in October 2014.
Among the main agenda items were a seminar on strengthening cooperation, in particular in areas related to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Banking Union, reporting on the activities of the Contact Committee and its technical partners and audits carried out by members of the Contact Committee with regard to the EU.
The Court also cooperates with the SAIs of EU Member States on a bilateral basis.
A good example of this is a project carried out jointly by the Court and the SAIs of Poland, Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, in which the auditors of the Polish SAIs took an active part in our audit work in Poland on the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases.
In addition, in the context of the chapter on the outcome of the 2014 annual report, the Court cooperates with the SAIs of Poland and Portugal on Europe 2020.
Meeting of the Contact Committee in Luxembourg on 15-17 October 2014.
Our activities 41 Network of Supreme Audit Institutions of Candidate Countries and Potential Candidate Countries Cooperation between the Court and the SAIs of candidate countries and potential candidate countries is mainly carried out through a network similar to the Contact Committee1.
During 2014, the Court assisted the network in carrying out a parallel energy efficiency impact assessment, in particular by providing experts for the sector and for the methodology of the audit.
International organisations for public financial control bodies In 2014, the Court continued to play an important role in the activities of INTOSAI and gave important contributions to various committees and working groups: • under Objective 1 of INTOSAI as a member of the Technical Standards Committee and as a member of the Sub-Committee for the Audit of Accounting, the Sub-Committee for the Audit of Legal Standards and the Sub-Committee for Economic Audits; • under Objective 2 of INTOSAI as a member of the Committee for the Development of Skills and the Sub-Committee for the Promotion of Best Practices and Quality Assurance through Voluntary Peer Reviews; • under Objective 3 of INTOSAI as a member of the Committee for the Exchange of Knowledge and its Working Group on Environmental Audit and the Working Group on Financial Modernisation and Regulatory Reform. The Court participated in the IXth EUROSAI Congress in June 2014. In this context, it organised and organised a workshop on "Measuring your performance".
He also attended the XLI. and XLII. meeting of the EUROSAI Bureau, to which he has been a member since 2011.The Court continued to actively participate in EUROSAI's working bodies, in particular the IT audit and environmental audit work groups, the Accompanying Committee for the Establishment and Operation of the Electronic Good Practice Database on Audit Quality, as well as the Task Force on Audit and Ethics.
The Court also joined the newly established Task Force on Disaster Aid.
In the context of the INTOSAI Joint Conferences of Regional Working Groups, the Court took an active part in the Second Joint ASOSAI2-EUROSAI Conference, which focused on the lessons learned from the experience gained in the context of the adoption of the ISSAI3 and its implications for the future.
1 In January 2015, the network included six candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey) and a potential candidate country (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
Since November 2013, Kosovo* has been participating as an observer in the network. * This designation does not affect positions on status and is in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.

3 International standards for Supreme Audit Institutions.
Our activities 42 key events International expert review of the Court In 2013, the Court asked the SAIs of France, Germany and Sweden to carry out a peer review of their economic audit practice.
The peer review was based on the experience of all three partners and was a very useful exercise for both the court and the experts.
The methodology was based on generally accepted criteria for the work of SAIs and took into account the guidelines set out in international standards.
The peer review was published on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu) in 2014.
The peers concluded that the Court had made considerable progress since the last peer review in 2008.
The Court had examined the challenges posed by the complex institutional framework of the EU and had taken a number of steps to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its audits and the quality of its audit reports.
International auditing principles encourage international peer reviews to be carried out.
These allow Supreme Audit Institutions to obtain a voluntary assessment of the performance of their tasks based on international standards.
In 2014, the Court chaired the peer review of the Supreme Audit Authority of Lithuania and was asked to assess the Swiss Federal Financial Control and to participate in peer reviews of the SAIs of Spain and Latvia.
High-level conference on improving accountability in the EU From left to right: Jacques Sciberras, Head of Cabinet, Kevin Cardiff, Member of the Court, President Vítor Caldeira and EP Vice-President Olli Rehn.
In October 2014, the Court organised a high-level conference, to which many people were invited to ensure that the European Union complied with its accountability with regard to public funding to achieve its objectives.
The conference focused on gaps, overlaps and challenges at EU and Member State level identified in the Court's Landscape Analysis of EU Accountability and Public Financial Control Regulations (see page 35).
The conference provided an opportunity for discussion among participants, including members or representatives of the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court, the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the European Stability Mechanism, national audit courts and science. It discussed how these arrangements should be developed in response to developments in economic, budgetary and monetary integration.
The focus was on accountability within the EU, in particular with regard to central banks and supervisory authorities, post-crisis structures, increasing the leverage of EU funds through external participation and a stronger focus on EU performance.
The conference agreed that there was a need for greater cooperation between governmental authorities, parliaments and auditors at EU and Member State level in order to give the public a better picture of what the EU's policies and programmes are doing.
Our activities 43 Strengthening partnerships with national authorities in Lithuania A high-level delegation from the Court visited Lithuania in September 2014 to strengthen partnerships with Parliament, the Government, the Central Bank and the SAIs of the country and to promote the best possible use and control of EU expenditure there.
The Court and its partners in Lithuania exchanged views on the priorities for improving the EU's accountability obligation and considered how they could best contribute through their cooperation to fostering the added value of EU spending and help policy-makers and Parliament in Lithuania to make the best use of the Court's audit results.
During the visit, the Court delegation took an active part in the Lithuanian Parliament's conference on the challenges of accountability and audit in the public sector.
In addition, the delegation and its partners discussed issues of financial and economic governance and the benefits of Lithuania's accession to the euro area on 1 January 2015.
Lithuania was the first of a number of EU Member States the Court intends to visit in the coming years in order to strengthen partnerships with national authorities responsible for managing and controlling EU funds.
Our Management 44 The College of the Court The College of the Court is composed of one member from each Member State.
Under the Treaty, the term of office of the members of the Court shall be six years and a reappointment shall be possible.
Members are assigned to one of five chambers.
The boards adopt audit reports and opinions and take decisions on broader strategic and administrative issues.
In addition, each member is responsible for his or her own duties, which are primarily audit-related tasks.
The underlying audit work is carried out by the Court's auditors and coordinated by the competent member, assisted by his cabinet.
The member shall then present the report for adoption by the Chamber and/or by the whole College of Court, and subsequently the presentation in the European Parliament, the Council and other interested parties, including the media.
In accordance with the proposals of its Member States and after consulting the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union appointed six new Members of the European Court of Auditors in 2014.
Four of these members – Alex Brenninkmeijer (Netherlands), Danièle Lamarque (France), Nikolaos Milionis (Greece) and Phil Wynn Owen (United Kingdom) – welcomed the Court on 1 January, two more – Klaus‐Heiner Lehne (Germany) and Oskar Herics (Austria) – were welcomed on 1 March 2014.

Our management 46 Court strategy for 2013-2017: Achieved progress in 2014 was the second year in which the Court implemented its strategy for the period 2013-2017.
This period will maximise the value of the Court's contribution to the EU's public accountability.
In order to achieve this objective, the Court's main priorities are to: ο focus the Court's products on improving the accountability of the EU; ο cooperate with other actors to reinforce the Court's contribution to the accountability of the EU; ο develop the Court as a professional audit body; ο make optimal use of the Court's knowledge, expertise and expertise available to it; ο demonstrate the Court's capacity and accountability.
In 2014, the strategy initiated a major restructuring of the Court's organisational structure.
Two internal working groups dealing with the strategy ("Strengthening the audit process" and "Improving the definition of tasks and responsibilities") presented their results.
This coincided with the European Parliament's report on the future role of the ECA and the results of the peer review process to which the Court has subjected itself.
The various recommendations were summarised in a far-reaching reform project, whose implementation started at the end of 2014 and will last until mid-2016.
In the case of special reports, this means that they are to be prepared in a shorter time, and in the case of the annual report, greater focus and resource savings are sought.
Two things are to be done to transform the farm into a task-based organisation.
This will improve its ability to use resources specifically for those audits and analyses that bring the greatest added value to EU citizens.
Our management 47 Measuring the Court's performance Since 2008, the Court has been applying central performance indicators (ZLI) to inform management of progress towards its objectives, support the decision-making process and provide information on performance to its addressees.
The ZLI reflect the Court's priorities and provide information on its performance and accountability as a professional audit body.
The indicators are used to measure core parameters for the quality and impact of the Court's work, with particular reference to the point of view of key stakeholders and the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of resources.
The ZLIs have been updated for the period covered by the 2013-2017 strategy.
Assessment by addressees Relevant reports Probable impact of the reports Quality and impact of the Court's work The Court assesses the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of assessments by addressees and expert reviews. Another assessment criterion is the measures taken on the basis of its recommendations to improve EU financial management.
In addition, the court measures its media presence.
Assessment by addressees The Court has asked its main addressees – the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament, the Council's Committee on Budgets, the main audited bodies at the Commission and EU agencies, as well as the Presidents of the EU ORCB – to assess the relevance and impact of its reports published in 2014 on a five-tier scale from "very high" to "very low".
2 100 % very low 13 56 25 4 13 53 25 9 0 % 20 % very high 40 % 60 % high medium low The replies show that 94% of the main addressees consider the value of the ECA reports to be relevant for their work (2013: 98%). 91% believe that the Court's work has an impact (2013: 94%).
Our management 48 expert reviews Each year independent external experts review the content and presentation of a sample of Court reports for quality assessment. In 2014, the reviewers assessed eight special reports as well as the 2013 annual reports.
They assessed the quality of different aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale from "significantly impaired" (1) to "high-quality" (4).
Audits of Court reports by experts The very consistent results in recent years indicate the satisfactory quality of Court reports.

Some recommendations can be implemented quickly, while others require more time due to their complexity.
At the end of 2014, 69% of the nearly six hundred recommendations that the Court formulated during the period 2011-2014 were implemented.
This represents an increase compared to the implementation rate of 60% recorded in 2013 for the recommendations made in 2010-2013.

Our management 49 Media presence The indicator concerning the court's media presence reflects the effect of the court in the media.
It concerns the strategic objective of raising awareness of the Court, its products and its audit findings and conclusions.
In 2014, the Court identified more than 5 100 online articles relating to its special reports, the annual reports 2013 and the institution in general.
40 % of which related to audit reports, while in the other articles reference was made to the institution and its work in general.
Over 800 articles have been published on the Special Report Airports of the ECA Implementation of the work programme The Court plans its audits and other tasks in the light of the annual work programme and monitors progress during the year.
In 2014, the Court carried out 95% of the tasks foreseen in its work programme (90 %).
While work on the annual reports and special annual reports was carried out as planned, this was the case for the special reports for 85% (2013: 70%).
The economic audits which were not completed in 2014 were carried over to 2015.

Our management 50 Preparation of special reports In order for the Court's special reports to have an effect, they must be submitted promptly.
In recent years, the Court has managed to shorten the time required for the examinations.
The objective of the 2013-2017 strategy is to achieve further improvements and this strategy is expected to produce measurable results in the coming years.
Processing period of the special reports issued in 2014 In 2014, the Court prepared 24 special reports, of which 42 % (2013: 37 %) were completed within the 18-month timeframe envisaged by the Court.
On average, 19 months were needed for the preparation of the special reports adopted in 2014 (2013: 20 months).

Training days per examiner per year 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 2012 2013 2014 Average number of training days for examiners (without language courses) The Court once again exceeded the target for the professional training of examiners, as can be seen from the importance it attaches to personnel development.
For 6.4 target ≥ 5 days 5.2 5.8 consideration of language courses, an average examiner accounted for 10 training days in 2014.
Support for audit activities Personnel resources Personnel allocation As a result of the difficult situation of public finances in Europe, the Court continued the staff reduction of 1% per year over a period of five years (2013-2017), as laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of December 2013.
As a result, staff in 2014 was reduced from 891 to 882 temporary officials and staff (excluding members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of the posts in total, 561 are allocated to the audit chambers (including 113 staff in the members' cabinets).
In 2014, with a view to achieving the best possible use of resources, possibilities for increasing efficiency through the unification of procedures were once again identified and implemented in all activities.
The redeployment of staff from support to audit services was also continued in 2014.
However, this was compensated by the shift of certain support services from members' cabinets into an administrative pool and the transfer of the Communication and Institutional Relations Unit to the President's services.
51 Recruitment The Court's employees have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
The Court's recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and the staff consists of both civil servants and operators with temporary contracts.
In 2014, an internal selection procedure for grade AST 1 and a selection procedure for the recruitment of a speaker were carried out.
The Court also provided placements for 77 university graduates for periods of three to five months throughout the year.
In 2014, the Court recruited 78 staff, 31 officials, 29 temporary staff, 13 contract staff and five seconded national experts.
The number of vacancies has been close to 3% since 2011 (on 31 December 2014 there were 27 vacancies).

Supporting audit activities 52 Balance between men and women Like the other EU institutions, the Court conducts a policy of equal opportunities in personal management and recruitment.
Following a continuous increase in the proportion of women over the years, the Court has now achieved a balanced share of 50% of men and women among its employees.
The graph below shows the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility on 31 December 2014, which has hardly changed in recent years.

Support for audit activities 54 The action plan on equal opportunities aims to achieve a balanced proportion of men and women at all levels of the Court.
According to the last wave of recruitment, 48% of employees in grades AD 5 to AD 8 are women (an increase compared to 43% in 2009).
Age profile The age profile of active staff on 31 December 2014 shows that 53% of the farm's staff are 44 years old or younger.
20-24 0.1 % 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65+ 0.3 % Since the next five to ten years are expected to be renewed in senior management positions, the growing proportion of women in the AD function group will result in more women in leadership positions in the future.
27 (40%) of the 67 directors and heads of units are 55 years old or older.
As a result, in the next five to ten years, when they retire, there will be a renewal in senior management positions.

Supporting audit activities 55 Support services Professional training For the further development of the Court as a professional examination body and for the optimal use of its existing knowledge, as well as the expertise and expertise at its disposal, continuous training of staff is necessary in order to be able to keep pace with professional developments and to acquire new skills.
In 2014, the Court's staff (auditors and other employees) completed on average eight days of professional training.
The proportion of language courses in continuing vocational training continues to decline.
In 2014, this represented 43% of the total number of training days (compared to 46% in 2013).
To make the best use of existing resources and technologies, the Court has been offering its employees individually tailored e-learning courses and training activities since 2014 in the form of integrated learning, in which the participants complete the general theory in an online training course before the presence event.
In addition, the objective of exchanging existing internal knowledge and providing the Court's auditors with the most up-to-date information on developments in the public sector audit process has continued to organise presentations of internal and external experts on developments in audit and other relevant areas.
Translation Translation is an audit support activity that enables the Court to fulfil its mission and achieve its communication objectives by providing the results it provides in the languages of EU citizens.
In 2014, the total translation volume was 4% higher than in 2013.
More than 98% of the translations were completed on time.
In addition to normal translation work, the Translation Directorate further expanded the direct participation of translators in the Court's audit and core business: translators provided linguistic support on 40 audit visits throughout the EU and in drafting audit reports.
In 2014, the Translation Directorate focused on quality assurance.
For this purpose, the first quality assurance manual was adopted in the translation sector and a system for customer feedback was developed.
Finally, in order to make the services more efficient, the process of translation work has been reviewed and optimised.In cooperation with the Information Technologies Directorate, the automation of the process has begun.
Support for audit activities 56 All processes related to the development and provision of instruments have been carried out in order to ensure the security and continuity of operations: for example, in 2014 after the new K3 building had been purchased, a comprehensive test was carried out on the re-initiation of a breakdown of IT systems (disaster recovery), and central IT components have been modernised (e.g. introduction of the Court's e-mail system migration).
Administration and infrastructure The role of the Finance and Support Services Directorate is to provide adequate resources, services and infrastructure to enable the Court to fulfil its mission and achieve its strategic objectives, and to ensure that the necessary financing, internal controls and accounting mechanisms are available to support all the Court's activities.
In 2014, the Directorate continued to focus on making its activities even more efficient and economic.
An environmental management system for the Court is currently being developed in line with the principles of the Community system for environmental management and audit (EMAS), with certification to be obtained by the end of 2016.
In 2014, a number of measures were successfully implemented, which yielded concrete results and demonstrate the Court's commitment to the environment, including: • adoption of an environmental policy; • implementation of an environmental analysis and an assessment of compliance with environmental law; • increasing the number of campaigns to sensitize employees to environmental concerns from four in 2013 to eight in 2014; • obtaining BREEAM environmental certification (the world's leading method for designing and evaluating sustainable buildings) for the K3 building and maintaining the certification mark for good waste management; • promoting sustainable transport among workers by providing a new bicycle room with showers and changing areas for cyclists, by installing an electric car charging station and by reserving good parking places for cycling communities.
Support for audit activities 57 Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union.
The Court's budget accounts for around 0.093 % of total EU expenditure and 1.58% of total administrative expenditure.
In 2014, the overall budget execution rate was 98.8%, compared with 92% in 2013.
The higher execution rate is mainly due to better estimation and planning of expenditure in Title 1, which achieved an average execution rate of 98.8%.
For Title 2, the average execution rate was 98.4%.

Supporting audit activities 59 Auditing and accountability Internal audit of the Court The internal auditor advises the Court on risk control issues by giving opinions on the quality of management and control systems and recommendations to improve the conditions for handling operations and to promote sound financial management.
The internal auditor also supports the work of the external auditor, whose mission is to certify the Court's annual accounts.
The internal auditor reported to the Court on the results of the audits carried out during 2014, the findings, the recommendations and the measures taken on the basis of those recommendations.
The Court reports annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal auditor's work.
In October 2014, the Court's internal audit certified compliance with the definition of internal audit, code of conduct and standards established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IAA).
This certification was the result of a comprehensive quality evaluation of the Court's internal audit carried out by an external evaluator, Deloitte SARL, at the request of the Internal Auditor and the Internal Audit Committee. Furthermore, it met the IIA's international standards for internal audit professional practice.
External audit of the Court The Court's annual accounts are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same transparency and accountability principles to itself as to its audited bodies.
The auditor's report – Pricewaterhouse‐ Coopers SARL – on the Court of Auditors' annual accounts for the financial year 2013 was published on 18 September 2014.
The audit opinion of the independent auditor – Financial year 2013 On the annual accounts: "We are convinced that the annual closure will give a true picture of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2013, its profitability and cash flows for the year ending on that reference date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Eura‐tom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of the Financial Regulation.
Declaration by the 60 authorising officer by delegation The undersigned, Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, hereby declares, in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation, that the information contained in this report is accurate and accurate, and confirms with sufficient certainty that the resources provided for the activities described in this report have been used for the purposes envisaged and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and that the control procedures established provide the necessary guarantees for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and for the proper handling of fraud or suspicions of fraud, costs and benefits of the controls are appropriate.
This security is based on the assessment of the undersigned and on the information available to him, such as the reports and statements of the authorising officers by subdelegation, the internal auditor's reports and the independent auditor's audit reports on previous financial years.

Foreword by President 04 Dear reader, in 2015, to which the present activity report refers, the European Union was once again faced with major challenges: significant developments in the EU's governance, policy and financial management, including the establishment of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the introduction of the Single Resolution Mechanism for banks in the euro area.
These and other developments have led to new audit tasks for the Court.
In 2015, we also reviewed the activities of the EU institutions and other bodies, as well as all EU funds paid to Member States, countries outside the EU, international organisations and other beneficiaries.
In accordance with our obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we have prepared annual reports on the general budget of the EU and on the European Development Funds, as well as special annual reports on the accounts of more than 50 EU agencies and other bodies.
In addition, we produced 25 special reports on numerous topics, the results of which are summarised in the present activity report.
We would like to draw your attention in particular to two special reports: our report on the emissions trading system, which shows that our work goes beyond purely financial matters, and our report on financial assistance to countries in difficulty, which is part of a series of new special reports on financial and economic governance.
In addition, we delivered eight opinions last year on new or amended EU legislation with significant financial implications, including an opinion on the Regulation establishing the EFSI.
In order to make a difference with our work, we need to pass on the lessons learned to stakeholders at EU and national level.
During the year, we have further deepened our cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union – our main partners in ensuring EU accountability.
We presented the results of our audits to an increasing number of specialised committees of these bodies, and we took their concerns into account when planning future audits.
The Court also paid high-level visits to the Member States in order to strengthen partnerships with national authorities, parliaments and audit bodies.
In 2015, we organised two notable conferences: one in Brussels on EU energy security and the other in Luxembourg on the future of development aid against the background of the new United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
We also prepared a major internal reform in order to better respond to continuous developments within the European Union.
This report explains some important changes that we have made in relation to our relations with stakeholders, our audits and our resources.
In addition, you will receive important information about our human resources management, finances and achievements and the results of our internal and external audits of the past year as well as about the recent annual discharge procedure.
I hope that this report will give you a useful and interesting overview of the Court's activities in 2015, and with these activities we want to fulfil our mission of improving EU financial management, promoting accountability and transparency and protecting the financial interests of EU citizens.
05 Our activities Our management • Annual reports on the EU general budget • and the European Development Funds for the financial year 2014, which essentially contain the Statements of Assurance and the audit results. • 52 special annual reports with the Court's audit opinions on the accounting of the individual agencies and other bodies of the EU and two summary reports. We carried out an internal reform to streamline our audit and reporting procedures and allow greater flexibility in the management of our resources. • 25 special reports on certain management topics and budgetary areas, including the emissions trading system, youth employment programmes and assistance during the financial crisis. • 8 opinions on new or amended EU legal acts and other decisions affecting financial management, from the proposed regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments to the amended regulation on the Single Resolution Mechanism. • Meetings, seminars and conferences with our addressees, including two high-level conferences on EU accountability, one on the security of energy supply and the other on the future of development assistance.
We continued our equal opportunities policy with regard to recruitment and personnel management. • We made considerable progress in integrating audit management and audit documentation information systems. We also made audit-related information available on mobile devices. The premises of the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg.
Our activities 06 Audits Our audit reports and opinions form an important link in the EU's accountability chain, as they are used to hold the bodies responsible for the budget management of the EU accountable, especially in the context of the annual discharge procedure.
These bodies are primarily the European Commission, but also the other EU institutions and bodies.
In areas with shared management, Member States also have an important role to play, as in expenditure on agricultural and cohesion measures.
Our three main products are: • Annual reports which essentially cover the results of audits of the accounts and compliance audits of the European Union budget and of the European Development Funds (EDF), but also aspects of financial management and performance aspects.
• Special reports presenting the results of selected economic or compliance audits on specific expenditure or policy areas or on budgetary or management issues. • Comments on new or amended legal acts affecting financial management and other products based on analyses, either at the request of another institution or at the Court's own initiative.
We strive to manage our resources in a way that ensures an appropriate balance between our various activities, while well covering the various areas of the EU budget and achieving sound results.
In 2015, we used a significant share of our resources to draw up the annual Statements of Assurance, which were then presented in our annual reports.
The work on which the Statement of Assurance is based includes the two aspects on which we have to deliver an annual audit opinion in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
We also take into account, as far as possible, the work of other auditors (see section on the examination of EU agencies on page 14) and the management declarations in the form of the Annual Activity Reports of the Directors-General of the Commission.
In addition to statutory audits, we will choose specific expenditure or policy areas at our own discretion. This is based on criteria such as the risk of irregularities or inadequate performance, potential for improvement and public interest.
We select these topics completely independently, but take into account the positions of our addressees.
In 2015, we produced 25 special reports, which are in particular the result of our audit work.
The summaries of the special reports are presented in this activity report (pp. 15-33).
In 2015, we issued eight opinions on proposals for new or amended regulations and regulations (p. 34).
In particular, we would like to draw attention to our opinion on the EFSI in order to clarify both the issue and the impact of our opinions.
All audit reports and opinions are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).

Our activities 08 audit visits in 2015 While most of the audit work was carried out at the Court's premises in Luxembourg, the auditors also carried out audit visits to Member State authorities, other beneficiaries of EU funds within and outside the European Union (including organisations involved in the award of EU funds, such as the European Investment Bank's regional offices in Kenya and Uganda) and other EU institutions, agencies and bodies.
Through these visits, we obtained direct audit evidence from the bodies involved in the authorisation, administration, collection and payment of EU funds, as well as from the respective final recipients.
Our audit teams usually consist of two to three examiners, and the duration of an inspection visit may be a few days, but also several weeks.
The frequency and intensity of the audit work in each Member State and beneficiary country depend on the type of audit and, where appropriate, sample selection.
The number of visits may therefore vary from country to country and from year to year.
Within the EU, our audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States visited.
In 2015, the Court's auditors spent 4 310 days with on-the-spot audits – in Member States and outside the EU – and obtained audit evidence for annual reports and selected audit tasks (special reports).
They also spent a lot of time with the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as with decentralised agencies and bodies throughout the EU.
The field audits took less days than in 2014.
This is due to more efficient working methods and an increasing use of technologies such as secure data and documents exchange and video conferencing.
Detecting fraud Although our audits are not specifically designed to detect fraud, we occasionally encounter cases in which we suspect irregularities or fraudulent activities.
In combating fraud against the EU budget, the Court cooperates with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
We shall forward to OLAF any suspicion of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the EU's financial interests during our audit work.
OLAF will then follow up these cases, which will decide on possible investigations and, where appropriate, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
In 2015, we forwarded 27 cases of suspected fraud to OLAF (2014: 16 cases).

Our activities 10 Annual reports on the 2014 financial year In 2015, we devoted most of our audits to accounting and compliance audits to the implementation of the EU budget for the 2014 financial year.
The 2014 Annual Report from this work was published on 10 November 2015 and presented to our audience, including the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the European Union (Economy and Finance Council), national parliaments and governments, as well as the media.
The main objective of our annual report is to support the European Parliament, the Council and citizens in assessing the quality of EU financial management by presenting findings and conclusions.
In the 2014 Annual Report, we provide a assurance of the use of EU funds in the financial year under review and highlight areas where the risk of EU funds not being used properly was greatest.
In addition, we analyse why errors have occurred and make useful and cost-effective recommendations on possible improvements.
We have revised the structure of our annual report on the financial year 2014 in order to make the report more readable.
The headings of the chapters now correspond to those of the headings of the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020.
The core element of the report remains the Statement of Assurance, in which we deliver our audit opinion on the reliability of the EU's annual accounts and on compliance with revenue and expenditure rules.
In addition, we have specifically assessed all the EU's key areas of activity and provided extensive information on budgetary and financial management.
The report shall also include information on the performance of the EU budget and on the Commission's performance reporting, in particular with a view to making progress towards the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
President Vítor Caldeira presents the European Parliament with the Annual Report 2014 of the European Court of Auditors. EU expenditure in 2014 amounted to 142.5 billion euros = nearly 300 euros per citizen
Our activities 11 The key statements of the 2014 Annual Report The European Court of Auditors calls for a new approach to EU investment and expenditure. - The reliability of the EU's accounts was confirmed for 2014. - Revenues were lawful and correct in 2014. - Payments were substantially affected by errors in 2014.
Conclusions and recommendations 是 The 2014 EU annual accounts were properly drawn up in accordance with international principles and give a true picture of the situation.
Therefore, we were once again able to give an unqualified opinion on their reliability.
However, we gave a failed audit opinion on the regularity of payments. 的 The estimated error rate, which measures the extent of the irregularities, is 4.4% for 2014 payments, close to the error rate for 2013 (4.5%) and consistently above the materiality threshold of 2%. 的 The estimated error rates we have calculated were equal (4.6%) for expenditure subject to shared management with Member States and for expenditure directly managed by the Commission.
The highest error rates were recorded for expenditure under the heading 'Economic, social and territorial cohesion' (5.7%) and 'competitiveness for growth and employment' (5.6%).
For administrative expenditure, the lowest estimated error rate (0.5 %) has been calculated. There is a clear link between expenditure types and error rates.
The estimated error rate for reimbursement schemes (5.5%), where the EU reimburses eligible costs for eligible activities on the basis of cost statements drawn up by beneficiaries, is twice the estimated error rate for payment entitlement-based schemes (2.7%), where not costs are reimbursed, but payments depend on compliance with certain conditions.
Without these measures, the estimated total error rate would have been 5,5 %.
The Commission needs further improvement with regard to risk assessment and the impact of corrective action. If the Commission, Member State authorities and independent auditors had used all the information available to them, they would have been able to prevent or detect and correct a significant part of the errors prior to their occurrence.
The Commission should take action to address this persistent problem.
Partnership agreements and programmes do not sufficiently take into account the objectives of Europe 2020 by Member States.
These two aspects enable the Commission to monitor and report on the performance and contribution of the EU budget to Europe 2020 only on a limited basis. 我 The upcoming mid-term review of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework is crucial for the management of EU expenditure.
It is important that the Commission analyse the areas with persistently high error rates as soon as possible, assess the possibilities for reducing those error rates, paying greater attention to the performance of expenditure.
Our activities 12 Examination of transactions in the various EU spending areas - Results for 2014 Expenditure area Natural resources Economic, social and territorial cohesion Competitiveness for growth and employment Europe in the world Administration Verified population and estimated error rate 5.6 % 2.7 % 0.5 % 3.6 % 5.7 % Audit conclusions 57.5 billion Euro 55.7 billion Euro 13.0 billion Euro 7.4 billion Euro 8.8 billion Euro 0 20 40 60 billion Euro The table was taken from the EU 2014 review summary, which is available on our website (eca.europa.eu/en/euauditin letter-2014).
Our activities 13 Annual Report on the European Development Funds (EDF) for 2014 的 Revenues were not affected by errors. 的 Payments were heavily affected by errors. Under the EDF, the European Union grants funds for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
The EDFs are financed by the Member States and managed outside the EU budget by the European Commission and, for some aid, by the European Investment Bank.
Their revenue was not significantly affected by errors, while payments had an estimated error rate of 3.8%.
As in previous years, we identified weaknesses in ex ante controls.
The estimated error rate is almost two-thirds due to errors related to non-compliance with procurement rules and lack of evidence to justify expenditure.
Our annual report on the EDFs will be published together with our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget and is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Our activities 14 Special annual reports for the financial year 2014 A total of EUR 4 billion was allocated to all EU agencies, bodies and Joint Undertakings in 2014.
EU agencies, other bodies and Joint Undertakings perform certain tasks on behalf of the EU and are based in different EU Member States.
They are active in a number of areas, such as safety, health, research, finance, migration and transport, and each has its own mandate, a board of directors, a director, staff and a budget.
In 2015, we produced 52 special annual reports on the financial year 2014.
They covered 41 decentralised agencies, executive agencies and other EU bodies, eight European Research Joint Undertakings, the European Schools, the Galileo Joint Undertaking in liquidation and the Sisnet communication infrastructure.
We also published two summaries that give an overview of the results of our audits in this area (one on EU agencies and other bodies and the other on the Joint Undertakings).
These reports were submitted to the President of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control of Parliament, the General Affairs Council and the Council's Committee on Budgets.
In 2014, the individual accounts of the 33 decentralised agencies and other EU bodies were independently audited for the first time by a private audit firm.
In drawing up our audit opinions on these financial statements, we took account of this audit work and of the measures taken by the audited bodies on the basis of the auditor's findings.
The financial statements of the other agencies and Joint Undertakings have been fully audited by us.
We found the accounting of all agencies, other bodies and Joint Undertakings in 2014 to be reliable.
The operations were lawful and proper, except for Artemis (embedded ICT systems), ENIAC (nanoelectronics) and ECSEL (electronic components and systems).
In general, the agencies have further improved their procedures by taking corrective action on the basis of our comments from previous years.
Our special annual reports and the two summaries of the results of our audits of the agencies, other bodies and Joint Undertakings for 2014 are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
52 special annual reports on the EU agencies, other bodies and Joint Undertakings based throughout Europe Headquartered by Europol, The Hague, Netherlands.
Our Activities 15 Special Reports issued in 2015 In addition to our annual reports and special annual reports, we publish special reports throughout the year, which contain the results of the economic and compliance audits that we carry out on specific budget areas or management issues of our choice.
When selecting and designing these audit tasks, we are committed to achieving maximum impact and thus making the best use of our resources.
Our economic audits often cover several financial years, and their subject matter is complex, so it may take more than a year for these audits to be completed.
In 2015, the special reports focused in particular on the following topics: the overall EU objective of creating added value and growth, and the EU's response to global challenges such as the sustainability of public finances, the environment and climate change.
The 25 special reports prepared in 2015 will be briefly presented under the respective headings corresponding to the headings of the multiannual financial framework.

Our activities 16 100 80 60 40 20 0 Competitiveness for growth and jobs EUR 143 billion 13% Smart and inclusive growth The "Intelligent and inclusive growth" heading covers most of the EU budget expenditure.
This area includes the two sub-headings "Competitiveness for growth and employment" and "Economic, social and territorial cohesion".
The sub-heading "Competitiveness for growth and employment" includes funding for trans-European energy, transport and telecommunications networks, business development, research and innovation, education and training, social policy, etc. The planned expenditure in this area for 2014-2020 represents 13% of the total EU budget for the programming period, i.e. EUR 143 billion.
In 2015, budget allocations of EUR 15.7 billion were made. • Inland waterway transport in Europe: no significant improvement in the share of modes of transport and shipability conditions since 2001 (No 1/2015) – This special report examines whether projects co-financed by the EU budget have contributed effectively to increasing the share of modes of transport in inland waterway transport and to improving shipability, and whether EU strategies for inland waterway transport have been coherent and based on relevant and comprehensive analyses.
Projects co-financed by the EU have not been implemented effectively, so that inland waterway transport could not be achieved as an alternative to freight transport on the road, nor could shipability be improved.
Although the Commission had made inland waterway transport a priority, the Member States have paid little attention to inland waterways.
There is no coherent overall strategy among Member States linked by the main maritime corridors, and river maintenance and political and environmental considerations are not sufficiently taken into account in EU strategies.
Member States should prioritise those inland waterway projects that bring the greatest and most immediate benefits, and the Commission should focus its resources on those projects where advanced plans for the elimination of bottlenecks are available.
EU internal shipping projects received EUR 1.3 billion in funding from the TEN-T programme, the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund during the period 2007-2013.
Our activities 17 • Is the need of micro-entrepreneurs adequately met by EU financial support?
(No 8/2015) – This special report analyses whether the needs of micro-entrepreneurs are met by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Progress Microfinance Facility.
The auditors found that there were weaknesses in programming and design of ESF financial support and that the provision of services was not adequately and reliably monitored.
Neither the Commission nor the Member States had comparable information on the administrative costs of each Member State and funding mechanisms.
These circumstances could undermine the effectiveness of EU financial support to micro-entrepreneurs.
Member States should identify needs in the design of financial instruments and in the preparation of operational programmes, including financial support for micro-entrepreneurs by the EU.
The Commission should make the use of ESF financial instruments by Member States dependent on robust risk management systems.
Microfinance is usually used for loans of less than EUR 25 000, often less than EUR 10 000.
Total demand in the EU Member States is estimated at more than EUR 12 billion by way of financing.
Examples mentioned in the report include the provision of EUR 5 000 for the development of a city kiosk and the provision of EUR 9 500 to support the creation of a playground and clothing business. • Improving the security of energy supply through the development of the internal energy market: major efforts are needed (No 16/2015) – This special report examines whether the implementation of internal energy market policies and EU spending on energy infrastructure have contributed effectively to achieving a benefit in the field of energy security.
The audit showed that energy infrastructure in Europe is generally not yet geared towards fully integrated markets and therefore does not currently provide an effective security of energy supply.
The Commission should therefore identify non-active EU energy infrastructure and work with Member States to remove obstacles to its use for the purposes of the internal energy market.
In addition, the Commission should consider new ways of making energy from one Member State available to customers in another.
The internal energy market is intended to allow the free movement and trade of natural gas and electricity throughout the EU.
The EU budget allocated EUR 3.7 billion to finance energy infrastructure from 2007 to 2013 and another EUR 7.4 billion is expected between 2014 and 2020.
However, the report points out that the EU's objective of completing the internal energy market by 2014 has not been achieved.
Our activities 18 Economic, social and territorial cohesion Smart and inclusive growth The sub-heading "Economic, social and territorial cohesion" includes regional policies designed to help the least developed countries and regions of the EU to connect with the rest, strengthening the competitiveness of all regions and promoting cooperation between them.
The planned cohesion expenditure for 2014-2020 represents 34% of the EU budget for the entire programming period, i.e. EUR 367 billion.
100 80 60 40 20 0 367 billion EUR 34% • Efforts to resolve public procurement problems in EU cohesion spending should be stepped up (No 10/2015) – This special report examines whether the Commission and Member States are taking appropriate and effective measures to address the problem of public procurement errors in cohesion policy.
The audit found that there are still widespread problems in public procurement across the EU.
Although the Commission and the Member States have begun to tackle the issue, much remains to be done.
Serious errors led to a lack of fair competition and contracts not being awarded to the best bidders.
Systematic analysis is only carried out to a very limited extent and there is a lack of sufficiently accurate, reliable and coherent data on the nature and extent of the errors.
In the event that the situation does not improve by the end of 2016, it is recommended that payments for the period 2014-2020 be suspended to the Member States concerned.
In the period 2007-2013, EUR 349 billion was allocated to regional policy expenditure to be paid through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund.
A substantial part of these funds will be spent through public procurement.
Errors were identified for around 40 % of the projects that the Court assessed in the light of its annual reports on the 2009-2013 financial years in the context of public procurement.
Our activities 19 • EU funding of municipal waste water treatment facilities in the Danube Basin: Member States need further support to achieve the objectives of EU waste water policy (No. 2/2015) – This special report assesses how effectively Member States in the Danube Basin have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in achieving the objectives of EU waste water policy.
The audit showed that while the EU spending programmes had a significant share of the progress made in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, delays in compliance with the rules and the use of available EU funds have occurred in all countries.
Although waste water was generally adequately treated in these countries' facilities, treatment of sewage sludge and rain overflows was sometimes inadequate.
One third of the plants were oversized and potentially unsustainable in the long term.
Countries were only slowly making use of the available EU funds so that they were at risk of losing EU funding or of needing additional funds from national budgets.
The Commission should reinforce reporting requirements and Member States should establish legislation to ensure an immediate connection to public sewerage.
The Commission and the Member States should establish criteria for all uses of sewage sludge and ensure reliable monitoring of pollutants.
The Danube catchment area is Europe's largest catchment area.
The EU contribution to wastewater treatment projects in the four audited Member States amounted to • 7.9 billion euros in the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 programming periods. Water quality in the Danube basin: progress in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, but still need for further measures (No. 23/2015) – This special report examines whether the implementation of the Water Framework Directive by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia has led to a better quality of surface waters in the Danube basin.
The assessment showed that there have been few improvements since 2004.
The main reason for the limited progress was that Member States' plans were not ambitious enough.
Specific measures were missing for water bodies with insufficient quality.
In addition, inadequacies in the monitoring systems led to a lack of data, both in terms of the type of pollution and the sources of pollution, which were responsible for a negative assessment of the state of water bodies.
In addition, Member States have excluded a significant number of bodies of water without sufficient justification of important deadlines.
In the period 2007-2013, Member States in the Danube basin received EUR 6.35 billion from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund for wastewater treatment.
During the same period, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development allocated €6.39 billion to compensate farmers for agri-environmental measures.
Our activities 20 • EU Youth Guarantee: The start is made, but implementation risks are foreseeable (No. 3/2015) – This special report examines whether the Commission has adequately supported the Member States in setting up the Youth Guarantee and whether there are potential risks in terms of implementation.
The audit identified three risks that could prevent the effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee: the adequacy of the overall budget, the definition of a "high-quality" job and the way in which the Commission monitors the Youth Guarantee and reports on the results.
The auditors concluded that the Commission provided timely and appropriate support to Member States in implementing the Youth Guarantee.
However, the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment indicating the expected costs and benefits, although this is a standard procedure.
While the Commission had asked the Member States to submit cost estimates when submitting their Youth Guarantee implementation plans, some did not provide the required information, and no Member State indicated the estimated cost of the necessary structural reforms.
The Youth Guarantee was established in June 2013 in response to the worsening situation of unemployed young people, exacerbated by the economic and financial crisis.
In the period 2014-2020, the Youth Guarantee – through the European Social Fund and a special Youth Employment Initiative – will be co-financed from the EU budget with a total of 12.7 billion euros. • Commission support to the Youth Action Teams: a successful but insufficient focus on ESF funding (No. 17/2015) – This special report examines whether the Youth Action Teams submitted proposals in 2012 on how ESF funding can deliver faster and more effective results for unemployed young people, and whether these proposals have contributed to the redeployment of ESF funding.
The auditors found that although the youth action teams established by the Commission managed to shift funds into projects to support young people, they made only limited proposals.
The Commission provided advisory support to Member States, but was limited by the size and quality of the information available.
While the initiative resulted in the reprogramming and reallocation of resources from the European Social Fund, the Commission focused its assessment of the changes to operational programmes mainly on their budgetary implications.
Unless there are discrepancies between the promises made and the objectives actually achievable by the Commission, there should be no too high expectations of such initiatives.
As part of its Youth Opportunities Initiative, the Commission set up youth action teams in 2012.
The teams were composed of experts from the eight Member States with the highest youth unemployment figures and experts from the Commission.
The initiative was based on a budget of almost EUR 10 billion from the European Social Fund, which was still available in the Member States concerned.
Our activities 21 Natural resources 417 billion euros Sustainable growth: natural resources This heading covers the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policy, rural development and EU environmental measures.
Three-quarters of expenditure concerns direct payments to farmers and support for agricultural markets.
The planned expenditure for 2014-2020 represents almost 39% of the total EU budget for this programming period, i.e. EUR 417 billion.
In 2015, the budget for 2015 was EUR 56 billion.
100 80 60 40 20 0 39% • Technical assistance: what contribution has it made in the fields of agriculture and rural development?
(No 4/2015) – This special report examines the use of technical assistance funds for agriculture and rural development during the 2007-2013 programming period.
The audit focused on the regularity, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of funding at the level of the Commission and the Member States.
The audit showed that neither the European Commission nor the Member States were able to demonstrate how well the use of technical assistance in agriculture and rural development has contributed to the economic use of the budget and to the objectives of the common agricultural policy.
Rural networks designed to promote cooperation, exchange of knowledge and innovation in the agricultural sector are very well suited as recipients of technical assistance.
In most cases, however, the funding for capacity-building has been used to support the general administrative budgets.
The Commission should clarify the scope and use of technical assistance for rural development in the Member States and closely monitor its implementation.
For the period 2007-2013, Member States had planned to use EUR 1.5 billion of EU budget for technical assistance, with a ceiling of 4% of the national envelope available for rural development.
For the period 2014-2020, this amount increased to around 1.9 billion euros.
Our activities 22 • Are financial instruments in the field of rural development a successful and promising instrument?
(No 5/2015) – This special report addresses the question of whether the financial instruments (credit and guarantee funds) used under rural development policy have been well designed and managed during the 2007-2013 programming period.
The audit showed that the financial instruments were not yet successful.
This is mainly due to the fact that the financial instruments were overcapitalised and could not develop their potential in terms of the desired leverage effect and the revolving effect.
There were no clear arguments for the introduction of financial instruments in the 2007-2013 programming period.
Nor was there reliable quantifiable information available to justify the nature of the financial instruments set up, to determine the demand for agricultural financial instruments and to demonstrate that the amount of capital earmarked for a fund was adequate.
Increased incentives should be provided for Member States to establish rural development financial instruments and to strengthen the demand of farmers or other beneficiaries, and appropriate standards and targets for leverage and revolving effect should be established for the period 2014-2020.
By the end of 2013, the EU and its Member States had invested around EUR 700 million in the Guarantee and Credit Fund for Rural Development.
The Commission would like Member States to commit themselves to at least double the use of these instruments for the period 2014-2020.
Close-up of an economic impact assessment: Integrity and implementation of the EU ETS (No. 6/2015) The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is in some way different from other policies and programmes that we are examining because it does not receive significant funding from the EU budget.
However, it has a huge impact on the implementation of policies in the EU and on the quality of life of citizens.
The EU ETS was introduced in 2005 and is often referred to as a reference model for the development of climate change mitigation strategies and emissions trading systems elsewhere in the world.
Therefore, an appropriate framework would be expected to ensure market regulation and supervision, legal certainty and systems for managing essential information.
The basic structures of the implementation systems should also be sufficiently sound.
At the end of 2013, our reviewers examined the framework for the protection of the integrity of the EU ETS and the systems for the effective implementation of the programme at the Commission and in the Member States by phase II (end of 2012).
The audit was carried out on the basis of the risks inherent in the creation of a functioning market for the implementation of EU climate protection policy and the difficulty of controlling an activity that is not tangible ("How to measure hot air?").
Our auditors examined whether the EU ETS has been adequately managed.
They not only carried out file checks and interviews with officials involved in the management of the EU ETS at the European Commission in Brussels, but also visited the competent authorities in five Member States (Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom).
In addition, two other countries (Greece and Spain) have reviewed documents and consulted experts.
Further evidence was obtained from the verifiers by reviewing the documentation of national authorities on 150 installations selected in these seven Member States.
Our activities were analysed 23. The auditors were not able to monitor the plants on site, as they did not receive EU funding in connection with the emissions trading scheme and the Court therefore did not have the necessary access rights to be audited.
The evidence obtained by our auditors indicated a lack of supervision of the emissions market and insufficient cooperation between regulatory authorities.
For example, our auditors found that the legal definition of allowances should be clarified and that the procedures for opening ETS accounts in the Union registry and for monitoring transactions were not appropriate to ensure adequate controls against abuse.
However, the initial situation was difficult: Member States could not effectively monitor cross-border transactions because they did not have direct access to the central database, and the Commission could not monitor the transactions because there was no legal basis for this.
In addition, our auditors found that the emission monitoring and reporting systems were not harmonised and that there were weaknesses in the control system, and that the Commission's support and the reporting of the Commission and the Member States were inadequate.
From their findings, the auditors concluded that the framework for market integrity protection is not sufficiently sound and that there have been clear weaknesses in implementation in the last phase, some of which require further measures in the current phase.
However, our report also clearly shows that this innovative system has been continuously improved.
At the time of the publication of the report, the debate on possible reforms of the EU ETS, which focused on the effectiveness of the system and the handling of excess allowances, was still ongoing.
However, in our report we point out that attention must also be paid to the fundamental questions of market integrity and implementation, so that the EU can trust that this core instrument is sufficiently suited to meet the expectations regarding emission reductions and low-carbon technologies.
We have made a number of practical recommendations to the Commission and Member State authorities to improve market integrity and the implementation of the system in order to make the EU ETS a more effective instrument for achieving the climate targets by 2020 and beyond.
The Commission agreed with the report's recommendation that major remaining problems with the regulation and supervision of the emissions market should be addressed in order, where appropriate, to improve market integrity, and that many improvements have already been made for Phase III (2013-2020) taking into account in particular our comments.
The report sparked great media interest and was presented by EU-accredited journalists at a press conference in Brussels.
In the EU and worldwide, the press reported that the EU ETS had to be more closely monitored in order to improve the carbon market. Furthermore, the system had to be more protected against market abuse, including from the still high risk of VAT fraud.
As is customary with all special reports, the member responsible for the report – in this case Kevin Cardiff – presented the report to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and, in addition, to the environmental committees of the Parliament and the Council, in order to inform them of the Court's findings which may serve as a basis for future decisions on relevant rules and regulations.
Parliament and the Council welcomed our comments and recommendations and will take into account future proposals to improve the integrity and implementation of the system.

Our activities 24 • Are the fisheries partnership agreements well managed by the Commission?
(No 11/2015) – This special report examines whether the agreements are well managed.
The auditors assessed the negotiation and implementation of the agreements, the monitoring of catches by the Commission and the selection and control of the actions financed.
The investigation showed that although the agreements were generally well managed, the quantities negotiated were often higher than the quantities reported for previous periods.
This regularly leads to incomplete use.
As the EU makes full payments regardless of de facto fishing, the actual costs were often higher than the negotiated price.
In addition, there was a lack of reliable, uniform and complete data on the actual catches of the EU fleet.
The Commission should take into account earlier utilisation rates when negotiating new schemes, which make payments more closely related to actual catches and ensure that the new catch database is fully used by flag Member States and contains reliable catch data that can be monitored and kept up-to-date.
The agreements aim to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries concerned by allowing EU vessels only to catch the partner countries' surplus resources.
However, the auditors doubt that the so-called "surplus" can be reliably calculated as reliable information is lacking. • The EU priority of promoting a knowledge-based economy in rural areas has been hampered by the inadequate management of knowledge transfer and advisory measures (No 12/2015) – This special report examines in particular whether there are management and control systems to effectively implement knowledge transfer and advisory measures in the area of rural development.
The audit showed that the implementation of EU-funded vocational training and guidance programmes in rural areas is too expensive, often leads to duplication of existing programmes and favours established training providers.
The auditors identified poor administrative procedures in the Member States and insufficient monitoring by the European Commission.
The Member States relied too much on the proposals of the trainers and considered each type of training to be 'good' and eligible for public support.
The lack of a fair and transparent selection resulted in the repeated selection of existing and established providers for a long time and received most of the funding.
Member States should select training projects that meet a qualification requirement identified in a recurring analysis and avoid the selection process being determined by the providers.
The EU supports training and advisory projects in rural areas with funds from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
For the period 2007-2013, EUR 1.3 billion was allocated to these projects.
Together with the co-financing of Member States, public funding amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
Over the period 2014-2020, the corresponding amount could amount to more than EUR 4 billion.
Our activities 25 • The cost-effectiveness of EU rural development aid for non-productive agricultural investment (No. 20/2015) – This special report identifies in particular whether non-productive agricultural investments (NPIs) are cost-effective and contribute to the achievement of the objective of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to manage agricultural land sustainably during the 2007-2013 programming period.
The auditors concluded that although NPI aid contributed to the achievement of the objectives, it was not cost-effective as the costs for 75 % of the projects visited were unreasonably high.
Many of these projects were fully financed by public funds, although they had apparently profitable features. e auditors visited four Member States, which spent a total of 80% of the total EU budget on NPIs: Portugal, Denmark, the United Kingdom (England) and Italy (Apulia).
Only five of the 28 projects audited proved to be cost-effective.
The report warns that lack of cost efficiency may not be limited to the sample, as the problems identified were due to shortcomings in Member States' management and control systems.
Non-productive investments are investments that do not generate significant returns or revenues, nor significantly increase the value of the beneficiary's operation, but have a positive impact on the environment. • EU rural infrastructure support: The funds could be used much more efficiently (No. 25/2015) – This special report examines whether the European Commission and Member States have achieved a good cost-benefit ratio by financing roads, water systems, schools and other facilities through rural development programmes.
The audit showed that while some infrastructure projects have made a positive contribution to rural areas, Member States and the Commission have achieved insufficient cost-benefit ratios in shared management.
With the resources available, much more could have been achieved, and the need for EU funds for rural development has not always been clearly explained by the Member States.
The risk of supporting projects that would have been implemented without EU funding has not been effectively controlled.
The Commission has been pursuing a more proactive and coordinated approach since 2012.
When properly implemented, this should lead to better financial management over the period 2014-2020.
Under rural development programmes, EUR 13 billion of EU funding was allocated to rural infrastructure from 2007 to 2013.
Our activities 26 100 80 60 40 20 0 Foreign policy EUR 65 billion 6% Europe in the world The heading "Europe in the world" covers the external relations of the EU (the "foreign policy"), including enlargement issues, as well as EU development and humanitarian aid.
For the 2014-2020 programming period, the EU has allocated 6% of its planned total expenditure, i.e. EUR 65 billion, to these objectives.
The budget for 2015 was EUR 7.5 billion.
Additional funds will be made available through the European Development Fund, which is not part of the EU budget and therefore does not fall within the multiannual financial framework. • EU Police Mission in Afghanistan: Mixed Results (No 7/2015) – This special report assesses whether the EU Police Mission (EUPOL) has been well planned and coordinated, whether it has received adequate operational support and appropriate guidance, whether it has contributed to progress in the Afghan National Police and whether its exit has been prepared in appropriate form.
The audit showed that EUPOL has met the objective of contributing to the development of a sustainable and efficient civilian police force under Afghan ownership.
In an environment characterised by the lack of a trained, fully functioning Afghan police force, a high illiteracy rate and widespread corruption within Afghan police and judicial systems, EUPOL has been able to contribute to the reform of the Ministry of the Interior and to the professionalisation of the National Police.
However, given the continuing systemic weaknesses in the police and judicial sector in Afghanistan, there is a risk that the results achieved by EUPOL and in the Afghan police sector in general will not last after the end of the mission at the end of 2016.
The total cost of EUPOL for the period May 2007 to December 2014 amounted to almost EUR 400 million, with security-related costs accounting for almost a third of this amount.
At the end of 2014, the EU had deployed a total of 32 Common Security and Defence Policy missions, 16 of which have been completed and completed and 16 are still under way.
Our activities 27 • EU support for the fight against torture and the abolition of the death penalty (No 9/2015) – This special report assesses the effective promotion of the prevention of torture, the rehabilitation of victims of torture and the abolition of the death penalty under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
The audit showed that, although the projects funded by the EU have effects, the projects are often not targeted enough and have a limited scope of action, as the funds are distributed in accordance with the watering-pot principle.
Although the allocation of funds was usually appropriate, the Commission did not take sufficient account of the priorities of each country in the field of human rights.
Projects have often not been well coordinated with other EU policies such as development aid and political dialogue.
They were generally carried out by dedicated and competent organisations.
The auditors' recommendations related to the target orientation of financial resources, better coordination with other EU actions, selection and improvement of project proposals, performance measurement and sustainability of the beneficiary organisations.
The European Union operates through diplomatic channels and grants to non-governmental organisations through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
In the period 2007-2013, some 180 grants totalling more than EUR 100 million were granted to projects to combat torture and the abolition of the death penalty. • EU support for wood-producing countries under the FLEGT Action Plan (No 13/2015) – This special report examines whether the Commission has managed well the support provided under the EU's FLEGT Action Plan to combat illegal logging.
The auditors noted that although the Action Plan is a welcome initiative, the overall results are meagre.
The aid was not granted to wood producing countries on the basis of clear criteria and its impact was diluted due to the large number of competing countries.
The countries concerned have made very different progress.
Insufficient progress is due, in particular, to the fact that there was no adequate planning by the Commission and no clear priorities in the allocation of funds to wood-producing countries.
The auditors recommended that the Commission set clear objectives and set the means to achieve them.
Four Member States still have to fully implement the EU Wood Regulation, which has been introduced to prevent illegal timber from being imported into the EU market.
In the period 2003-2013, 35 countries received EUR 300 million under the Action Plan.
Two of these countries, Indonesia and Ghana, made good progress on their way to a complete licensing system for their timber.
In general, however, little progress has been made and many countries have had difficulties in overcoming the obstacles that stood in the way of responsible policy-making.
In the 12 years since the Commission launched the Action Plan, no partner country has succeeded in establishing a fully recognised authorisation system.
Our activities 28 • The ACP Investment Facility: does it offer added value?
(No 14/2015) – This Special Report assesses whether the Investment Facility has added value for EU development cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
The audit showed that the Investment Facility actually provides added value for EU development cooperation with ACP countries and fits well into the EU's policy objectives.
At the end of 2014, credit lines accounted for 28% of the Facility's portfolio, compared to 14% at the end of 2010.
The increased share reflects the continued importance of the long-term financing provided by the Facility.
The facility also acted as a catalyst in a positive sense by mobilising additional funds.
However, the auditors found that the contractual obligation to inform final beneficiaries of the financing by the European Investment Bank (EIB) or the Investment Facility is not always met and that technical assistance is not always targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises.
They made recommendations to address these problems.
The ACP Investment Facility, established in 2003, receives its capital from the European Development Fund and is managed by the EIB.
The Facility has approved development projects worth EUR 5.7 billion over the past ten years.
The Facility provides medium to long-term financing and aims to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits. • Promotion of renewable energy in East Africa from the ACP-EU Energy Facility (No. 15/2015) – This special report examines whether the Commission has successfully used the Energy Facility to improve access of poor populations to renewable energy in East Africa.
The audit showed that some significant successes have been achieved, but the Facility needs to be monitored even better.
The Commission has made a good selection of the proposed projects, but has not closely monitored the progress of the project.
The project managers' reports were of different quality and the Commission did not make any efforts to enforce reporting obligations.
For projects known to have been affected by serious problems, the Commission staff made too few on-the-spot visits and verifications in the monitoring process to complete the information provided by those responsible.
The report made recommendations for stricter selection, stronger monitoring and improved sustainability of future projects.
By mid-2014, a total of 268 million euros were granted, of which 106 million euros for projects in East Africa, which had by far the least access to electricity in Africa.
Our activities 29 • Analysis of risks associated with a result-oriented approach to EU development and cooperation action (No. 21/2015) – The Special Report was prepared in the light of the increased interest that has recently been shown in shifting the focus of EU development and cooperation policy away from activities towards results.
The auditors identified nine key risk areas: a disparate outcome-related terminology or a logical chain between actions, outputs, effects and impacts; increased complexity due to the inclusion of cross-cutting issues in EU programmes; the lack of harmonisation of instruments for aid delivery, the outcome framework and the accountability structures of development partners; weaknesses in evaluation and outcome reporting; a lack of consolidated reports or an overview of the results obtained through EU assistance; a lack of adequate, relevant, reliable and up-to-date data; a focus on the budgetary outcome as an objective; changes in the context of measures.
The audit showed that these risk areas have been correctly identified by the Commission in numerous different documents.
However, further action is needed to exploit the full potential of the Commission's initiatives and to improve the EU's development and cooperation results.
Against this background, a number of recommendations have been made which the Commission should take into account.
Our activities 30 100 80 60 40 20 0 Financial and economic governance The EU framework for economic governance aims to address problematic financial and economic trends, such as excessive government deficits or sovereign debt that can dampen growth and threaten the sustainability of public finances.
Part of this framework is the establishment of the EU Banking Union.
According to the report on the European Banking Authority in 2014, this special report was the second we published on the subject.
In 2008, Europe faced a financial crisis that turned into a sovereign debt crisis.
The sovereign debt crisis was a consequence of different factors, including weak banking supervision, inadequate fiscal policies and the difficulties encountered by large financial institutions (and the subsequent costs of their rescue, which were borne by the general public).
The crisis broke down in two waves across the EU Member States, which first hit countries outside the euro area in 2008-2009 and later spread to the euro area itself.
Our auditors examined how the European Commission managed the financial assistance granted under the Balance of Payments Facility and the European Financial Stability Mechanism during the crisis, for which the Commission raised funds on the capital markets, with the EU budget as a guarantee.
The audit covered the financial assistance granted to Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Ireland and Portugal, with particular attention to the Commission's role in these programmes.
In addition, our auditors analysed the Commission's cooperation with its partners – the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington.
They obtained audit evidence through in-depth reviews and analyses of documents, as well as through discussions with officials of the Commission, national authorities, the ECB and the IMF.
The partners and decisions taken at EU political level were not the subject of the examination.
The audit showed that the European Commission was not prepared for the first requests for financial assistance during the 2008 financial crisis, as warning signals were overlooked, largely explaining the initially significant weaknesses in its administrative processes.
The auditors identified four key problem areas in the Commission's crisis management: different approaches, limited quality control, insufficient monitoring and lack of documentation.
In this context, they found several examples where countries were not treated in the same way in similar situations, and in some programmes the overall conditions for assistance were less strict and thus easier to meet.
They also found that the Commission's teams had insufficiently reviewed important documents, that the underlying calculations were not reviewed by anyone outside the team, that the work of the experts was not closely monitored and that the review procedure was not sufficiently documented.
Our activities 31 However, the auditors believe that, despite the lack of experience, the Commission has succeeded in fulfilling its new administrative tasks and in launching the financial assistance programmes relevant to the reform process, which should be considered a success in view of the time constraints.
In addition, the auditors found that, in the course of the crisis, the Commission increasingly built up internal expertise and worked with a wide range of stakeholders in the countries concerned, and improved macroeconomic monitoring was introduced in subsequent reforms.
For example, the objectives of the programmes have been met, the adjusted deficit targets have been largely met, the structural deficits have improved and Member States have met much of the conditions of their programmes, albeit with some delays.
In most cases, countries continued the reforms required by the programme conditions, and four of the five countries were able to adjust the current account more quickly than expected.
Our auditors pointed out that there are still a number of weaknesses and that the Commission must improve its procedures for managing financial assistance.
We have made a number of recommendations to the European Commission to ensure that financial assistance will be managed more effectively in the future when Member States with difficulties ask for support.
The report received a broad response, particularly in the European media, but also in the United States and Australia.
Like our other special reports, Mr Baudilio Tomé Muguruza, who is responsible for the report, presents it to the addressees in the European Parliament and in the Council.

Our activities 32 • EU supervision of credit rating agencies is based on sound foundations, but is not yet fully effective (No. 22/2015) – This special report examines whether the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has successfully established itself in the EU as a supervisor of credit rating agencies.
The financial crisis in 2008 has brought credit rating agencies and their influence on financial markets to the fore.
At that time, credit rating agencies in Europe were hardly regulated.
The audit showed that while ESMA has laid good groundwork, its rules and guidelines are not complete and there are still significant risks to be addressed.
The auditors found that ESMA was able to shorten the average duration of the registration procedure, but the procedure remains complex.
Although rating methods should be strict, systematic and consistent and be subject to validation, ESMA focuses its activities mainly on whether the methodologies are strict.
The current Eurosystem credit assessment framework does not ensure that all credit rating agencies registered with ESMA operate on an equal footing, creating a two-class market structure that puts small credit rating agencies in an unfavourable position.
The auditors made a number of recommendations to ESMA regarding the registration procedure, traceability of the risk assessment procedure, supervisory procedures and IT systems. • Technical assistance for Greece: Improved provision requires a stronger focus on results (No. 19/2015) – This special report examines whether the Task Force for Greece has fulfilled its mandate and whether technical assistance for Greece has contributed effectively to the reform process.
The Task Force was set up by the Commission in 2011 to support the economic adjustment of Greece with numerous technical assistance measures.
The auditors examined whether the task force has fulfilled its mandate and whether technical assistance has contributed effectively to the reform.
They obtained evidence from the Commission, service providers, Greek ministries and other stakeholders.
The audit showed that the Greek authorities have received technical assistance under the mandate, but that the reforms have not always made sufficient progress.
Due to the urgency of the situation, the Task Force was set up in the shortest possible time without a full analysis of other options or a separate budget.
The Task Force did not have a bundled, comprehensive policy document to provide technical assistance or set priorities.
The assistance provided was relevant and largely in line with programme requirements, and the Task Force developed a flexible and diversified implementation system. However, there were weaknesses at project level.

Our activities 33 Others 8.2% 100 80 60 40 20 0 VAT 12.8% TEM 13.3% GNI 65.7% Revenue The EU budget is mainly financed by revenue from three types of own resources.
These include own resources based on gross national income (GNI) and VAT (VAT) and traditional own resources (TEM), in particular customs duties on products imported into the EU and sugar levies.
In addition, the EU receives taxes levied on the salaries of EU staff, contributions from third countries to certain EU programmes and fines from companies that violate EU rules and regulations.
EU expenditure must be fully covered by revenue.
In 2015, revenue amounted to EUR 141.3 billion. • Combating intra-Community VAT fraud: further action is needed (No 24/2015) – This special report examines whether the EU is effectively combating intra-Community VAT fraud.
Organised crime means that the European Union is running out of VAT revenues of between EUR 40 billion and EUR 60 billion per year.
Since the export of goods and services from one EU Member State to another is exempt from VAT, criminals in both countries can fraudulently evade taxes.
As a result, both the countries concerned and the EU's revenues are being evaded.
The audit identified significant weaknesses indicating insufficient effectiveness of the current system.
In order to combat intra-Community VAT fraud, the EU has a wide range of instruments, but some of these instruments need to be improved or applied more uniformly.
In most Member States visited, there are no effective cross-checks between customs and tax data; Member States' tax authorities exchange VAT information, but there are problems with the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data; there is a lack of cooperation and overlaps of competence between administrative, judicial and law enforcement authorities.
To improve the system, action must be taken by the Member States, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
Our activities 34 opinions in 2015 We also contribute to improving EU financial management with our opinions on proposals for new or amended legislation with financial implications.
These opinions will be delivered at the request of the other EU institutions and used by the legislative authorities – Parliament and Council – in their work.
We can also issue position papers and analyses on other issues on our own initiative.
In 2015, we published eight opinions on a number of key areas: • Opinion No 1/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union; • Opinion No 2/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Financial Regulation of the Community Plant Variety Office; • Opinion No 3/2015 on a proposal for a proposal for a Financial Regulation of the Committee on Single Resolution; • Opinion No 4/2015 on a proposal for a Regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) (further details in the box); • Opinion No 5/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation of the Budget Committee of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market; • Opinion No 6/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Financial Regulation of the Committee on Single Resolution; • Opinion No 7/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation on traditional, VAT and GNI own resources and measures to make available the necessary cash resources; • Opinion No 8/2015 on a proposal for an amendment to the Financial Regulation for the 11th European Development Fund.
Focus: Statement on EFSI In response to the decline in investment since 2007, the Commission launched an "Investment Plan for Europe" in November 2014.
The investment offensive is based on the logic of intervention that there is a high investment need in Europe and numerous economically viable projects for which funding sources are sought.
The challenge is to make productive use of savings and financial liquidity to promote sustainable employment and growth in Europe.
The investment offensive is to be realized without burdening national budgets and new debt.
From this Investment Plan to its full implementation, the Commission expects to create between 1 million and 1.3 million new jobs and mobilise additional (mainly long-term) investment funds of at least EUR 315 billion in the period 2015-2017. The Commission's initiative is highly anticipated.
In order to contribute to the success of this initiative, we drew attention in our opinion to issues relating to the governance and legal framework, the accountability and external audit rules, and financial liabilities to public budgets.
We also pointed out that for instruments where the EU cooperates with the private sector, an appropriate level of transparency and accountability for public funds should be ensured.
The performance of these instruments should also be measured by the extent to which the objectives of the activities financed are achieved.
We drew attention to the fact that the agreements between the Commission and the European Investment Bank are not clearly described in the proposal.
Our opinion has been taken into account by the regulatory authorities in Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 on EFSI.
Our activities 35 Contribution to EU accountability through high-level events and conferences We hold conferences on issues where we have identified risks and can contribute to EU accountability through our audit expertise, thereby increasing awareness of the importance of sound financial management and control of EU finances.
In 2015, we organised the two conferences described below, which are in line with our strategic goal of working with our partners in the process of EU accountability.
During the year, we also organised seminars with internal and external experts on our premises to share knowledge about recent developments in EU policy and to use information for the planning and execution of our audits.
For example, in October a seminar focused on the progress made in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and representatives of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development took part in the seminar.
Court Conference on Energy Security in the EU On 5 May 2015, we held a conference on energy security in the EU in Brussels to provide stakeholders from EU institutions, Member States, energy industry and universities with a neutral and independent platform to discuss the challenges facing the EU in the field of energy security.
Our President Vítor Caldeira opened the conference, and Maroš Šefčovič, one of the Commission's Vice-Presidents, gave an introductory lecture.
Our members Szabolcs Fazakas and Phil Wynn Owen From left to right: Szabolcs Fazakas, Maroš Šefčovič, Vítor Caldeira and Phil Wynn Owen. headed the conference, which included panel discussions on the two main areas: Obstacles to completing the internal energy market and Ukraine's important contribution to European energy supply as an important transit country.
We organised this conference because the EU is facing a number of major challenges in this area, which are related to each other.
These include the creation of an internal energy market to improve the competitiveness of the European economy, the fight against climate change and the improvement of energy security.
In our tests, we are increasingly focusing on energy and climate issues.
We have already produced special reports on issues such as the internal energy market and security of energy supply, energy efficiency and renewable energies.
In addition, further reports are planned in this area, including on EU support to Ukraine and on EU spending on climate action, as well as a landscape analysis on energy and climate issues in the EU.
Our aim is to create added value for the EU's energy policy, and with this conference we have shown that we also want to support a democratic debate on these issues.
Our Activities 36 Conference of the Court on the Future of Development Assistance From 20 to 21 October 2015, we held an international conference on European development aid in Luxembourg on the occasion of the European Year for Development, the adoption of the new Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council.
At the beginning of the two-day conference chaired by our member Danièle Lamarque, our President Vítor Caldeira took the floor, followed by the Luxembourg Minister for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Affairs Romain Schneider, on behalf of the EU Presidency, by the Chairman of the European Parliament's Development Committee Linda McAvan, the EU Commissioner for Development Neven Mimica and the United Nations Under-Secretary-General Grete Faremo.
The conclusions of the conference were summarised by Marc Angel, chairman of the Committee on Foreign and European Affairs and for the defence of the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies.
The EU is the world's largest donor of development aid and cooperates with many public and private partners, including international organisations, foundations, non-governmental organisations and states.
It is becoming increasingly important to ensure the effectiveness of the aid, which can be achieved by fully respecting the criteria for its allocation and evaluation.
In this context, the Court plays a major role.
The new Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations for the period 2015-2030 are more ambitious than the previous Millennium Development Goals and encourage those to "think and act differently."
Participants agreed that development aid must be aligned with environmental, energy and migration policies and other policy areas, and that new stakeholders must be involved.
In addition, development agencies need to adapt to the increasing diversification of financing and financial instruments: innovative financial instruments contribute to a greater leverage effect and closer alignment with market conditions, but also make it more difficult to make financial decisions and determine the added value of aid.
The European Commission gave a presentation on what a results-oriented budget should look like, which would clarify how EU funds will be spent and what results will be achieved.
The Court also participates in the joint interinstitutional working group set up for this purpose.
Our activities 37 Relationships with the addressees The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union The value of our contribution to EU accountability depends to a large extent on the benefits of our key partners in the legislative and accountability process from our work results and products.
These partners are the political bodies responsible for public oversight of the use of EU funds: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the national parliaments.
In accordance with our strategy for the period 2013-2017, we have given particular attention to improving our working relations with Parliament and the Council.
The President and the Members of the Court have regular contacts with the committees of the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT), which is our main partner.
In 2015, President Vítor Caldeira presented our annual work programme and our annual reports in two meetings of the CONT. He also presented the annual reports in two plenary sessions of Parliament and participated in the discharge debate.
At the initiative of Ville Itälä, our institutional relations member, President Caldeira also presented our work programme for 2015 at the Conference of Committee Chairs and was informed about its priority areas in order to plan our work programme for 2016.
In October 2015, the CONT carried out a working visit to the Court, continuing the practice of annual bilateral meetings at the Court's premises in Luxembourg. In addition, our representatives participated in visits to Member States (Greece) and recipient countries (Serbia) organised by the CONT.
In 2015, our members represented the Court in 29 CONT meetings to discuss our annual and special reports.
In addition, our members presented nine special reports to the committees concerned.
We also organised a joint meeting with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and the Environment to discuss issues of common interest and started working with Parliament's Scientific Service to promote a more efficient exchange of knowledge between our audit chambers and the service.
We also worked more closely with the Council to strengthen and improve relations with the Council and its respective Presidency.
In November, President Caldeira and Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg's Finance Minister and Chairman of the Ecofin Council, met during the Luxembourg Presidency to discuss follow-up measures on the basis of our 2014 Annual Report in the context of the 2014 discharge procedure.
We presented our work programme for 2015 and 15 special reports to various Council working groups.
In addition, we presented the various chapters of the annual report to the Council's Committee on Budgets as a basis for the discharge procedure.
Annual meeting of Court representatives with the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament.
Our activities 38 Strengthening partnerships with national parliaments and authorities During the year, we worked closely with our addressees in the Member States.
We systematically informed the national parliaments of our work.
In addition, the President and the Members of the Court presented the annual report to the national parliaments and authorities of most Member States.
In addition, we held meetings with representatives of national parliaments and authorities at the Court's premises and in the Member States.
We continued our initiative, launched in 2014, to organise high-level visits to EU Member States to deepen our partnerships with national authorities responsible for managing and auditing EU finances.
In April 2015, a high-level delegation from the Court travelled to Poland to highlight the importance of public financial control and accountability for EU funds, to improve the Court's visibility in this respect and to initiate a dialogue with the relevant Polish authorities.
These included meetings with Polish President Bronisław Komorowski, head of the Prime Minister's Registry, both chambers of parliament, state and local authorities, and in particular the SAIs of Poland.
The discussions focused mainly on accountability and public control, as well as on our recent landscape analysis of EU rules on accountability and public financial control.
Meetings with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development provided an opportunity to discuss our landscape analyses, the results of relevant audits and best practices.
Our delegation visited two projects financed by EU funds. One is managed by the public authorities, the other by a private beneficiary.
The high-level visit to Poland was complemented by visits to the Czech Republic (June 2015) and Bulgaria (November 2015).
In the Czech Republic, our representatives met with the President of the Czech Republic Miloš Zeman, the Prime Minister and representatives of Parliament.
They also attended a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chamber of Deputies, which discussed the results of audits in the areas of common agricultural policy and cohesion of the previous programming period, which were relevant for the Czech Republic.
During this visit, our representatives contributed to the conference on electronic data and its importance for future audits organised by the SAIs of the Czech Republic.
During the visit to Bulgaria, our delegation met with the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Mr Rose Plevneliev, Prime Minister Mr Boyko Borissov, President of Parliament, Ms Tsetska Chachva and other representatives of the Parliament.
In addition, the delegation took part in a conference on the importance of external audit for effective public sector management, which was held on the 135th anniversary of the establishment of the SAIs of Bulgaria and on the 20th anniversary of the resumption of their activities.
From left to right: Vítor Caldeira (President of the European Court of Auditors), Krzysztof Kwiatkowski (President of the SAIs of Poland) and Augustyn Kubik (Polish Member of the European Court of Auditors).
Our activities 39 Cooperation with Supreme Audit Institutions The Court cooperates with other Supreme Audit Institutions (ORKBs), mainly through • the contact committee of the SAIs of EU Member States; • the network of SAIs of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; • international organisations for public financial control bodies, in particular the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
Contact Committee of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the EU Member States The EU Treaty requires the Court and the national audit bodies to cooperate in a trusting manner, while respecting their independence.
Cooperation with the SAIs of EU Member States is actively carried out within the Contact Committee, including an annual meeting and various working groups, networks and task forces dealing with specific issues of common interest.
In 2015, the Contact Committee met in Riga.
At its meeting, the members of the Contact Committee discussed the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the prevention and fight against irregularities and fraud and the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.
Questions on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) were also addressed.
The Contact Committee adopted a declaration on the rules for accountability and financial control of the Single Supervisory Mechanism addressed to national parliaments and governments and to the EU institutions and bodies concerned.
In addition, the Contact Committee agreed to the proposal to carry out parallel audits of the implementation of the SSM and the contribution of the Structural Funds to the Europe 2020 strategy and the underlying risks to the sustainability of public finances.
In November 2015, the Court invited a kick-off meeting of the Working Group on Structural Funds VII, in which a work plan for a new multilateral parallel audit should be drawn up to identify the extent to which EU funding in the areas of education and employment contributes effectively to the Europe 2020 strategy.
Network of Supreme Audit Institutions of Candidate Countries and Potential Candidate Countries Cooperation between the Court and the SAIs of Candidate Countries and potential candidate countries is primarily carried out through a network1 comparable to the Contact Committee.
In the course of 2015, we continued to support the network in carrying out a parallel impact assessment on energy efficiency.
The last workshop on this project took place in May 2015 in the premises of the Court in Luxembourg.
The Court is involved in the preparation of new projects to start in 2016 and focus on audit and audit of the accounts.
In May 2015, representatives of the Court took part in an event celebrating the 90th anniversary of the founding of the SAIs of Albania.
On this occasion, President Caldeira and the President of the Republic of Albania, Bujar Nishani, met.
Eight auditors from the SAI network took part in our 2015 internship program.
1 In January 2015, the network included six candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey) and a potential candidate country (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
Since November 2013, Kosovo* has been participating as an observer in the network. * This designation does not affect positions on status and is in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and the opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Our activities 40 Multilateral (INTOSAI – EUROSAI) and bilateral cooperation In 2015, we continued our active participation and participation in the activities of INTOSAI and EUROSAI, in particular in the respective working bodies.
In November 2016, with effect from the International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (INCOSAI), the Court was appointed Deputy Chair of the INTOSAI Technical Standards Committee at the end of 2016.
We also responded to the request of the SAIs of Ukraine, who is chair of the Working Group on Disaster Aid Audit, to host the first meeting of this Working Group.
The Court is also an active member of the EUROSAI Task Force "Test and Ethics", which aims to promote ethical behaviour and integrity in SAIs and public institutions.
The main objective of the Task Force is to establish and strengthen a framework for promoting ethical behaviour by providing SAIs with appropriate practical guidance and tools to support their day-to-day audit activities.
We participated in the 5th joint EUROSAI-ARABOSAI conference, which dealt with the supervision of plans for state bailouts, as well as the 2nd Young EUROSAI conference, which gave young auditors the opportunity to discuss issues on current issues.
In addition, we visited the Global World Leadership Forum of the SAIs, whose main topic was the role of public sector auditors in 2030.
The Court maintains good bilateral relations with other SAIs.
In 2015, for example, our delegation participated in an international seminar organised by the SAIs of Poland for auditors from Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in Warsaw.
The delegation spoke with the SAIs of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic about their experience of developing and building capacity to prepare for accession to the EU and gave training on our compliance and audit methods.
Cooperation with SAIs within the framework of international peer reviews Peer reviews are a common method of supporting best practices and promoting quality assurance.
The INTOSAI peer reviews subcommittee is responsible for updating the ISSAI 5600 peer review guide (ISSAI stands for International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions).
In 2015, we contributed decisively to the revision of this guide, which will be presented to the 2016 INCOSAI Congress for adoption.
We also played a leading role in the international peer reviews of the SAIs of Latvia, Spain and Switzerland.
The SAIs' expert assessment was very comprehensive and focused on methods and procedures for auditing the accounts, compliance and audit, as well as on the efficiency of the support functions.
The expert opinion of the SAIs of Spain, led by the SAIs of Portugal, also covered many aspects of the functioning of this body.
We were the sole assessor during the expert assessment of the SAIs in Switzerland.
The evaluation assessed the suitability of the SAIs' strategy as well as their planning and quality control processes.
Our Management 41 The College of the Court The College of the Court is composed of one member from each Member State.
Members shall be appointed by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, for a term of six years in accordance with the proposals made by each Member State.
Under the Treaty, members shall carry out their duties in full independence and for the general good of the European Union.
The President shall be elected by the members from among them for a period of three years.
The terms of office of the President and the members shall be renewable.
Most members are assigned to one of the five chambers, which adopt examination reports, opinions and position papers and take decisions on further strategic and administrative issues.
In addition, each member is primarily responsible for his or her own duties in the audit area.

Our management 43 Court Strategy for 2013-2017: continuous progress The goal of our five-year strategy is to maximise the value of our contribution to EU public accountability.
Our main priorities for achieving this aim are set out in the following figure: Many of the initiatives launched under the strategy have already been implemented.
We have increased the range of outputs, intensified and expanded our relationships with our addressees, accelerated our audit procedures and improved the way we measure our own performance.
In 2015, the Court decided to reform its organisational structure.
In this way, we will take into account the European Parliament's recommendations on the future role of the Court and the results of the international peer review process carried out in 2014 on our economic audits.

Our management 45 Flexible response in a rapidly changing environment We have developed a new work planning process that allows us to plan our work on the basis of priorities and a comprehensive risk assessment across the Court.
In the planning of our work, we now systematically take into account the views of the addressees in order to ensure the greatest possible relevance of our reports.
With the support of our member responsible for institutional relations, our President and Members are working together with EU addressees, including the committees of the European Parliament.
Flexible provision of resources for priority audit tasks We have organised our staff in flexible teams around specific tasks instead of in units to make it easier to assign priority tasks.
This means that we can now "use the right person for the right job" and use their abilities and potential to the full.
The reform also led to a more streamlined management of the Court: Head of Unit became senior managers who shared management responsibilities under the leadership of the respective director and contributed their expertise in the areas of quality and supervision.
We also strengthen our expertise in audit areas and introduce knowledge transfer tools to further improve our knowledge management processes.
Timely delivery of products We have streamlined our testing procedures and simplified our task management so that we can deliver products promptly.
In recent years, we have constantly reduced the average time needed to produce our special reports, and the reform will allow for a further reduction.
This is particularly important in the context of the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation.
Better communication about our role and work We have revised our annual report to refer to the headings of the multiannual financial framework, making it easier to use and more readable.
In the annual report we now report for several years on the main areas of expenditure and on performance.
Furthermore, we strengthened the functions in the areas of communication and relations with the addressees and discontinued a speaker.
Our Management 46 Measurement of Performance Since 2008, we have been using Central Performance Indicators (ZLI) to inform management of the progress made towards our goals, support the decision-making process, and provide our addressees with information on performance.
They reflect our priorities and provide information about our performance and accountability as a professional audit body.
The indicators are used to measure core parameters for the quality and impact of our work, taking into account the point of view of key stakeholders as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of resources.
The ZLIs have been updated for the period covered by the 2013-2017 strategy.
Quality and impact of our work We evaluate the quality and impact of our reports on the basis of assessments by users as well as expert reviews.
We also measure our presence in the media.
Appraisal by addressees We asked our main addressees – the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament, the Council's Committee on Budgets, the main audited bodies at the Commission and the EU agencies, as well as the Presidents of the EU-ORCB – to assess the relevance and impact of our reports published in 2015 on a five-stage scale from "very low" to "very high".
The replies show that 90% of our main users consider the value of our reports to be relevant to their work (compared to 94% in 2014). 92% believe that our work has an impact (91% in 2014).
Assessment by addressees 10% 21% 45% 24% 2% 0% very low 20% medium high 40% very high relevance of reports Probable impact of reports 60% 80% 100% 6% 23% 45% 24%
Our management 47 expert reviews Each year, independent external experts review the content and presentation of a sample of our reports for quality assessment. In 2015, the reviewers assessed four special reports and the annual reports for the financial year 2014.
They assessed the quality of various aspects of the reports on the basis of a four-stage scale of "significantly impaired" (1) to "high-quality" (4).
The experts' assessments in 2015 were higher than ever in the last four years, with an overall average of 3.3 for both reporting types.
Follow-up to recommendations We contribute primarily to improving the financial management of the EU by making recommendations to the Commission and other audited bodies in our reports.
Some recommendations can be implemented quickly, while others require more time due to their complexity.
We regularly check to what extent our recommendations have been implemented by the audited bodies.
By the end of 2015, 73% of more than 600 recommendations we had made in 2012-2015 had been implemented.
This represents an increase compared to the implementation rate of 69% recorded in 2014 for the recommendations made in 2011-2014.

It concerns the strategic objective of raising awareness of the Court, its products and its audit findings and conclusions.
In 2015, we identified some 3,400 online articles related to our special reports, annual reports and the Court in general.
54% of these were in our audit reports; in the other articles reference was made to the Court and its work in general.
In 2015, the media reported almost twice as much about our annual reports as in 2014.
However, the number of media reports on our special reports has decreased compared to 2014, largely due to the interest in a specific report of this year (EU-funded airport infrastructure (No. 21/2014) on which more than 800 articles have been published).
Efficiency and effectiveness of resource use We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our resource use according to the extent to which we are able to implement our work programme, carry out audits in a timely manner and ensure the expertise of our employees.
Implementation of the Work Programme We plan our audit and other tasks on the basis of the annual work programme and monitor progress during the year.
In 2015, we implemented our work programme to 88%.
While work on the annual reports and special annual reports was carried out as planned, this was 69% for special reports compared to our very ambitious planning.
The completion of the remaining special reports, which has been delayed due to evidence to be obtained or unexpected complexity, was transferred to the beginning of 2016.
These special reports mainly concern new or innovative tests, the completion of which can obviously take more time.
The Court's reform project, which is assessed under the heading "other tasks", progressed as planned.

Our Management 49 Preparation of the special reports In order for our special reports to have effect, they must be submitted promptly.
In recent years, we have managed to shorten the time needed for audits, largely based on initiatives resulting from the 2013-2017 strategy.
In 2015, we prepared our 25 special reports within an average of 17 months (19 months in 2014), i.e. for the first time in less than 18 months.
We will continue to try to shorten the time needed to prepare our special reports, in particular by responding to the new principle introduced in the amended Financial Regulation.
Professional Training In accordance with guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), we strive to provide each auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training (excluding language courses).
The objective for the vocational training of examiners has again been exceeded, as can be seen from the great importance we attach to the development of personnel.
Taking into account the language courses, an average examiner accounted for 9.4 training days in 2015.

Support for 50 audit activities Personnel resources Personnel allocation In 2015, we continued the staff reduction of 1% per year for a period of five years (2013-2017), as set out in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of December 2013.
As a result, in 2015, the staff allocation was reduced from 882 temporary officials to 872 (excluding members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
The audit staff included 562 employees, including 113 employees in the members' cabinets.
Recruitment The Court's employees have a broad academic and professional background, and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's output.
Our recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and staff is made up of both officials and temporary staff.
In 2015, we hired 63 staff: 30 officials, 17 temporary staff, 11 contract staff, four seconded national experts and one consultant.
We also provided internships for 74 university graduates for periods of three to five months.
At 31 December 2015, only 15 posts were vacant in the Court (1.7% of the total number of posts).

Supporting audit activities 51 Balance between men and women Like the other EU institutions, we have a policy of equal opportunities in terms of human resources management and recruitment.
For several years we have been able to maintain a balanced proportion of men and women among our employees.
The graph shows the proportion of men and women by level of responsibility as at 31 December 2015; these proportions have hardly changed in recent years.
Our action plan on equal opportunities aims to achieve a balanced share of men and women at all levels.
According to the latest recruitment waves, 50 % of employees in grades AD 5 to AD 8 are women (an increase compared to 48 % in 2014).
Renewal in the upper and middle levels of management and the growing proportion of women in the AD function group are expected to increase the proportion of women in management positions in the future.

32 of the 69 directors and executive managers (46%) are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, in the next five to ten years, when these employees retire, there will be a renewal in senior management positions.
Support services Professional training The job of the examiner requires continuous training in order to keep pace with professional developments and acquire new skills.
In 2015, our employees completed an average of 7.3 days of professional training.
The proportion of language courses in the total number of training days continues to decline.
Language courses accounted for 35% of the total number of training days in 2015 (compared to 43% in 2014).
Our main activities in the field of vocational training concern the modernisation of our training programmes and more intensive cooperation with learning opportunities within and outside the EU institutions and bodies.
We launched a cooperation with the University of Lorraine (Nancy, France) to offer a postgraduate course of study "Audit of public organisations and policies" and a Master's program "Management of public organisations".
Cooperation with the European Commission, which offers language courses for our staff, and with the European Administrative Academy, which has supported us in the organisation of the training on "soft skills" and the ECA training day, has continued.
In addition, we have expanded our range of courses even more strongly through individually tailored e-learning courses and training courses in the form of integrated learning (blended learning).
In addition, we continued our successful series of presentations held by internal and external experts on audit developments and other subjects related to the work of our auditors.
Finally, we introduced a framework for "Performance Recognition Awards" to reward the performance of non-executive staff with special training outside the Court.
Supporting Audit Activities 54 Translation Translation is an audit support activity that enables us to fulfil our mission and to achieve our communication goals.
In 2015, the total translation volume was as high as never before: almost 200,000 pages, an increase of almost 3% compared to 2014.
Around 99% of the translations were completed on time.
In addition to normal translation work, our translators provided linguistic support and interpretation services at internal events and meetings during 26 audit visits throughout the EU.
They also provided support for the drafting of preliminary observations and special reports, thereby becoming more involved in the Court's central audit procedures.
As a result of the review of the translation workflow and in the course of the Court's reform, the Translation Directorate optimised its structures in 2015 through the introduction of assistant pools.
A major project of the Directorate, GroupShare, will lead to significant improvements by further streamlining the work of the assistant pools in order to create space for efficiency improvements and automations, thereby standardizing the procedures of all language teams.
Information technology In 2015, the Information Technologies Directorate focused its efforts on adapting our administrative information systems to support the successful implementation of the Court's reform and on preparing developments in the field of knowledge management to support the Court's new organisational structure.
In addition, all the functions of the full version of the Assyst2 audit documentation system have been introduced for work on the Statement of Assurance, the Audit and related reports, thus completing this major project.
Our new audit management system (AMS) has been put into operation: more than 300 plans have been drawn up in the system and 180 audit tasks have been defined and monitored with the instrument.
Building on the technical foundations for mobility that have been introduced in recent years (providing the Wi-Fi network in all the premises of the yard, equipping all staff with laptops), the Directorate is currently focusing on global mobility, i.e. access to all content at any place, at any time and on all devices.
The project with regard to the development of a solution that ensures that employees can access our information on all devices will contribute to maintaining the business operations of the farm and to increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
Maintaining business operations during the development and delivery of IT solutions was ensured and critical systems were thus available at 99.82 %.
Supporting audit activities 55 Administration and infrastructure The role of the Finance and Support Services Directorate is to provide adequate resources, services and infrastructure to enable the Court to fulfil its mission and achieve its strategic objectives.
The Directorate shall also ensure that the necessary financing, internal control and accounting mechanisms are available to support all the Court's activities.
In 2015, the Directorate continued to focus on making its activities even more efficient and economical.
Because of the extraordinary situation following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November and the subsequent crisis situation in Belgium, we strengthened our security measures and acquired the necessary security equipment in the context of public procurement procedures.
Information on public procurement is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Building The yard currently owns three buildings ("K1, "K2, "K3, "K3, "K3) and offers small areas for its IT center for data recovery as well as a meeting room.
He also offers three offices in Brussels and one office in Strasbourg from the European Parliament.
In order to ensure the cost-effectiveness of our building policy, we take into account three factors: purchase or rental, follow-up costs and interinstitutional cooperation.
In developing and implementing our building policy, as in all our areas of activity, we strive to establish and meet the highest standards of transparency and accountability.
Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) The Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) is a management tool developed by the European Commission for companies and other organisations to assess, report and improve their environmental performance.
We started in 2014 with the development of an environmental management system2, which is in line with the principles of the European EMAS standard set out in the 2009 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council3.
Our goal is an EMAS certification by the end of 2016.
In 2015, the EMAS project made the planned progress.
2 The EMAS project at the Court was launched in July 2013.

Support for audit activities 56 Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union.
Our budget accounts for around 0.087 % of total EU expenditure and 1.51% of total administrative expenditure.
In 2015, the overall budget implementation rate was 98.68 %.

Support for audit activities 58 Audit and accountability discharge Like the other EU institutions, the Court is subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2015, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2013, which means that our annual accounts for 2013 were finally approved.
We have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our audit and management responsibility and have also taken appropriate measures in the context of our reform.
We have reported on our follow-up to the European Parliament.
Internal and external audit Internal audit of the Court The Internal Audit Service advises the Court on risk control issues by giving opinions on the quality of management and internal control systems and recommendations to improve the management of our operations and to promote sound financial management.
The department also supports the work of the external auditor, whose mission is to certify the Court's annual accounts.
Finally, the Internal Audit Service provides information on significant risks and corporate governance issues.
The Internal Audit Service is supervised by an Internal Audit Committee consisting of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee regularly monitors the progress made in the various tasks set out in the work programme of the Internal Audit Service.
The Committee also ensures the independence of the Internal Audit Service.
In 2015, the "Internal Revision" department produced special reports on strategic issues such as changes in our annual report, mid-term review of the implementation of our strategy for the 2013-2017 period and follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations from the peer review process and the European Parliament.
Taking into account the recommendations of the 2014 Internal Revision Service that the internal control cycle should be strengthened, we updated our IT security system and formalised the existing risk management framework and the existing guidelines.
The Internal Audit Service monitored the implementation of the new guidelines and ensured that their recommendations were taken into account.
We report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal audit.
External audit of the Court Our financial statements are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same transparency and accountability principles to itself as to the bodies that it assesses.
The auditor's report – PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à r.l. – on our financial statements for the financial year 2014 was published on 15 September 2015.
Support for audit activities 59 audit opinions of the independent auditor – Financial year 2014 As regards the annual accounts: "We believe that the annual accounts give a true picture of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2014 and its earnings and cash flows for the year ending on that reporting date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of the Financial Regulation.

Preface of the President 04 Dear reader, dear reader!
In 1977, the European Court of Auditors started its work – 40 years later, we look back on many successful contributions we have made to public accountability and EU financial management.
In October 2017, an official ceremony was held on the occasion of the Court's jubilee, attended by your Royal Highnesses of the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, the President of the Republic of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani and the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
Their participation in the event is a sign of the Court's importance as a "financial asset" of the European Union.
However, during the year, we also looked forward.
We discussed and agreed on a strategy for the remaining three years of the current Multiannual Financial Framework by the end of 2020.
Our citizens need access to clear and reliable information so that they do not lose their confidence in the EU and its institutions.
People must be able to see that the EU is dealing with integrity, upholding the rule of law, using public resources prudently, pursuing clear political objectives and achieving the results it has promised.
As external auditors of the Union, we are well positioned to examine and report on these aspects.
Throughout the year, we have published special reports on a wide range of EU policies and programmes, as well as analysis-based publications such as landscape analyses and rapid analyses.
In addition, we have drafted several opinions on legislative proposals and – as in every year – our annual reports on the general budget of the EU and on the European Development Funds, as well as on EU agencies and on many other Union bodies.
This activity report provides a comprehensive overview of our activities in 2017 and contains important information about the Court, its budget and its staff.
Klaus-Heiner Lehne President
2017 at a glance 05 Our activities Our management • 28 special reports investigating the effectiveness and added value of EU policies and programmes in areas such as youth unemployment, environment, migration and banking union; • a landscape analysis of EU action in the areas of energy and climate change and a rapid analysis of the reduction of human resources in the EU institutions; • • five opinions on new or amended EU legislation with a significant impact on financial management, including an opinion on the Financial Regulation for the • EU budget and an opinion on the financing of European political parties; • annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget and on the activities under the European Development Funds, together with the accompanying summary report "2016 – Brief information on the audit of the EU; • 55 special annual reports on the annual accounts of each EU agency, entity and Joint Undertaking located in different Member States, including two summary reports; • meetings, seminars and conferences with our institutional addressees and colleagues, such as the meeting of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the EU Member States' Supreme Audit Institutions, as well as conferences on youth unemployment and energy assessment, climate change.
We welcomed two new members: Juhan Parts (Estonia) on 1 January 2017 and Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz (Hungary) on 1 September 2017. • We issued a new multi-annual strategy that provides a guide to our work and management during the period 2018-2020. We also revised our work planning to ensure a more strategic, coherent and court-wide approach to the planning of our audit priorities. We also reviewed our risk management policy and strengthened our financial procedures. • We continued the reduction of posts agreed among the EU institutions while also implementing the policy of equal opportunities in recruitment and human resources management.
Our activities 06 Audits We carry out various types of audits in the different EU budget areas: • Economic Audits – Consider the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economy of EU policies and programmes.
The focus of these audits of optimal use of funds is on specific management or budgetary issues, which we select on the basis of criteria such as public interest, potential for improvement, risk of inadequate performance or irregularities; • Audits of accounts and compliance audits – the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions (in particular in the context of the Statement of Assurance) as well as assessments of whether the systems or operations in specific budgetary areas comply with the relevant rules and regulations.
On the basis of the evidence obtained from our audit work, our reports draw clear conclusions on the extent to which the EU's policy objectives have been achieved, as well as on the state of the Union's budgetary and financial management.
This information helps us to make appropriate and relevant recommendations from the point of view of cost efficiency.
Test visits in 2017 The majority of the examination work takes place at the Court's premises in Luxembourg.
At the same time, our auditors also carried out numerous audit visits to the other EU institutions, agencies and bodies, EU delegations, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States, as well as to international organisations such as the United Nations, which are involved in the allocation of EU funds.
We also carry out checks on beneficiaries of EU funds on the ground within and outside the European Union.
These controls will provide us with direct audit evidence of the bodies involved in the management of EU policies and programmes, the collection and disbursement of EU funds, as well as of the respective beneficiaries.
Audits are our core activity The frequency and intensity of our audit work in the individual Member States and recipient countries depend on the type of audit we carry out.
In 2017, our auditors spent 3,670 days with on-site inspections in Member States and outside the EU (2016: 4,246 days).
Within the EU, our on-the-spot checks are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Institutions (ORKBs) of the Member States visited.
3 670 days on-site audits in the Member States and outside the EU in 2017 In addition, our auditors spent 2 300 days (2016: 2 510 days) with the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as with decentralised agencies and bodies throughout the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations or the OECD, as well as audit firms.
We are increasingly using videoconferencing and other information technologies (such as the secure exchange of data and documents) to obtain and validate audit evidence.

Our activities 08 Detecting fraud We work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in combating fraud against the EU budget.
OLAF will then follow up these cases, which will decide on possible investigations and, where appropriate, cooperate with Member States' authorities.
In 2017, we forwarded 13 suspected fraud cases identified in our audits to OLAF Although our audits are not specifically designed to detect fraud, we occasionally encounter cases where we suspect irregularities or fraudulent activities.
In 2017, we forwarded 13 cases of this type (2016: 11 cases) suspected of fraud to OLAF. The suspicion of fraud arose as part of our audit activities on the Statement of Assurance for the financial years 2016 and 2017 as well as on other audit tasks.
Publications Our publications: Special reports, annual reports, opinions and analysis-based publications Our audit reports and opinions form an important link in the EU's accountability chain, as they are used to hold the bodies responsible for the EU's financial management accountable, particularly in the context of the annual discharge procedure.
In areas of shared management, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States also play an important role, as in the expenditure on agricultural and cohesion measures. Around 80% of the EU budget is implemented in this way.
Our range of publications includes • Special reports presenting the results of selected audits on specific policy or expenditure areas or on budgetary or management issues; • Annual reports containing mainly the results of audits of the accounts and compliance audits on the budget of the European Union and on the European Development Funds, as well as aspects of financial management and performance aspects; • Special annual reports on agencies, decentralised bodies and Joint Undertakings of the EU published separately; • Opinions on new or amended legal acts with a significant impact on financial management, either at the request of another institution or at the Court's own initiative;
Our activities 09 • Analysis-based publications: • Landscape analyses are descriptive and analytical documents on complex, broad policy areas or management issues in which we – often from a cross-sectional perspective – present our experience values and our collected knowledge on the selected subject; • Topic papers are similar to Landscape analyses, as they are also descriptive and analytical documents on politics or management, but their topics are more limited; • Rapid case reviews collect and present facts related to very clearly defined specific topics or problems.
All publications are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
In addition, all 2017 special reports, opinions and analysis-based publications are listed at the end of this report.

Our activities 10 Annual reports Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2016 In our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2016, we examined how the EU funds had been used in the financial year under consideration and showed in which areas the risk of EU funds not being used properly was greatest.
In addition, we have specifically assessed all key areas of the EU budget, on the basis of the headings of the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, and provided information on budgetary and financial management and performance-related information.
We also analysed why errors had occurred and made recommendations on possible improvements.
Audit of around 1 000 payments made from the EU budget in 2016 to beneficiaries Our auditors examined around 1 000 payments made to beneficiaries in the various expenditure areas of the EU budget.
This means that we analysed some 1 000 different cases where EU funds were used to support key infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in the EU Member States or to support beneficiaries in non-EU countries.
The discharge procedure begins with the presentation of our annual report on the financial year 2016 The publication of our annual report is at the beginning of the discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament for the implementation of the EU budget.
On 28 September, we presented our annual report to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) and subsequently also to the plenary of the European Parliament and the Ecofin Council and the national parliaments of the Member States.
Our activities 11 EU annual accounts give an accurate picture of the real situation; proportion of non-legislative expenditure fell further in 2016 Main conclusions - The 2016 annual accounts were drawn up in accordance with international principles and give a true picture of EU finances in all essential respects. - Revenues in 2016 were not significantly affected by errors. - In recent years, the estimated error rate for payments from the EU budget has continuously improved: 2016: 3.1%, 2015: 3.8% and 2014: 4.4%.
In 2016, a significant proportion of audited expenditure – claims-based payments (as opposed to reimbursement-based payments) – was not significantly affected by errors. 的 The Commission's reporting on regularity is largely in line with our results in most areas.
However, the Commission should simplify performance measurement, for example by reducing the number of targets and indicators. 你 Corrective measures by Member States and the Commission have had a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
Without these measures, the overall error rate we estimated would have been 1.2 percentage points higher.
However, sufficient information was available to prevent and detect a significant proportion of the errors and to correct them. The total amount of payments to which the EU committed itself under future budgets has been as high as never before and is expected to increase further.
Our activities 12 Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget contains for the first time a limited audit opinion on the regularity of the EU expenditures Lazaros S. Lazarou, the Court member responsible for the annual report Unrestricted audit opinion Error rate is less than 2% Restricted audit opinion Error rate is more than 2%, but only certain budget areas are affected Failed audit opinion Error rate is more than 2%, with the whole budget affected "The annual report for the financial year 2016 is of historical importance as it is clearly different from the previous reports.
In terms of compliance with EU legislation on the expenditure side, for the first time, we issued a limited and no longer a failed audit opinion.- Comparison between the estimated error rates for EU spending areas (2014-2016) Estimated error rates 5.7 5.6 2014 2015 2016 5.2 4.8 4.4 4.1 3.6 2.9 2.5 2.8 2.7 2.1 0.6 0.5 Expenditure on economic, social and territorial cohesion 0.2 Competitive natural Europe in resource management World Growth and employment
Our activities 13 Our institutional addressees also need information about the results of EU expenditure "This year's limited audit opinion shows significant improvements in EU finances.
In the future, we will rethink how we examine the EU's budget: − We will take greater account of internal controls carried out at the level of the European Commission and the Member States so that we can better promote accountability and further improve EU financial management. − We will also focus more on performance aspects in order to ensure that the resources of the EU's citizens are used to the best possible extent. − How important it is to pay attention to the performance achieved with EU expenditure and to the results achieved, was also emphasised by Joachim Zeller, Member of the European Parliament and rapporteur for the 2016 discharge: Klaus-Heiner Lehne, President of the European Court of Auditors, at the presentation of the annual report in the plenary session of the European Parliament on 4 October 2017 in Strasbourg, ‘Statements such as error rates or information on whether funds from the Structural Funds have been used correctly, are important, but we should also look at what has been achieved with these resources.
Our activities 14 Annual Report on the European Development Funds The European Development Fund (EDF) provides financial support to the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories.
The EDFs are financed by the Member States and managed outside the EU budget by the European Commission and, in some cases, by the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Some one third of the total EDF error rate is due to non-compliance with procurement rules.
Other important types of error include expenditure that is either not actually incurred or not eligible.
Our annual report on the EDFs will be published together with our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget and is available on our website (eca. europa.eu).
Special Annual Reports EU agencies and other bodies as well as European Joint Undertakings are based in different EU Member States. They carry out specific tasks in areas of utmost importance to EU citizens, such as health, security, freedom and justice, and research.
In 2017, the Court examined whether the agencies' annual accounts were reliable and whether the underlying transactions were in line with the rules.
When our audit opinions on the agencies' annual accounts were drawn up, we took into account, if available, the audit work carried out by audit firms.
We also examined the Sisnet communication infrastructure, the European Schools, the contingent liabilities of the Single Resolution Committee and the liquidation of the Galileo Joint Undertaking.
We have worked on consolidating the results and are expected to issue a single report for the agencies in 2018. i Key data EDF budget 2016 3.4 billion euros Audited amount 2.8 billion euros Accounting reliable revenue Non-deficit payments Mainly affected by errors (estimated error rate of 3.3%) i Key data Audited by the Court 45 EU agencies and other bodies, 8 Joint Undertakings Total 2016 budget 5.2 billion euros Total 2016 staff Around 11 000 staff The Court publishes 55 special annual reports, including two summary reports
Our activities 15 agencies (budget of 3.4 billion euros, 10 364 employees) Our audit showed that the annual accounts of all 41 agencies give a true picture of the situation.
The financial operations underlying the annual accounts were legal and proper for all agencies, except the European Asylum Support Office, for which we gave a limited opinion on the basis of non-compliance with public procurement principles.
Joint Undertakings (budget of 1.8 billion euros, 633 employees) The annual accounts of all eight Joint Undertakings were reliable.
They were appropriate to the assets and financial position of the Joint Undertakings and to the results of their operations and cash flows for the year 2016 in all material respects.
Moreover, the transactions underlying the annual accounts for seven Joint Undertakings were in line with the relevant legislation, except for the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, for which we gave a limited audit opinion, as we were unable to obtain sufficient assurance regarding the reliability of its internal controls on FP7 grants.
All special annual reports and the two summary reports are available on our website (eca. europa.eu).
Special Reports In 2017, we published 28 special reports.
In these reports, we examined in particular whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved in an effective and economic way and whether the EU funds have created added value.
We also made recommendations for improvements in terms of financial savings, better working methods, avoiding waste or more cost-effectively achieving the policy objectives pursued.
The special reports focus in particular on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economy of EU policies and programmes.Our special reports focused on issues relevant to the EU, such as the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources, the creation of growth and the promotion of inclusion, the challenges associated with migration and global development, the internal market and the banking union, as well as ensuring the accountability and economic viability of the European Union.
At this point, we will examine two of these 28 special reports: a special report on food waste, which dealt with the question of whether EU policies were appropriate to tackle this problem along the entire food supply chain, and a special report on the Greek financial crisis, which examined the EU's response to the financial and debt crisis in one of its Member States through the economic adjustment programmes.

Our activities 17 Special Report: Combating food waste: an opportunity for the EU to improve the resource efficiency of the food supply chain Food waste is a global problem Food waste is a global problem, which has become more and more the focus of public and political discussion in recent years, especially in view of the need to feed the growing world population.
Current estimates suggest that around a third of the world's food produced for human consumption is wasted or lost, resulting in high economic and environmental costs.
The EU auditors examined the role the EU can play in combating food waste The Court's auditors looked in particular at the measures taken so far and the way in which the various EU policy instruments work to reduce food waste.
The focus was on avoiding food waste and facilitating food donation as these two aspects were given the highest priority in the fight against food waste.
Our auditors interviewed the Commission staff responsible for the policy in question, carried out file checks and carried out audit visits in five Member States: Italy (Lazio), the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Finland.
They visited the relevant ministries and made on-site visits.
In addition, they consulted relevant stakeholders in the areas of food production, retail trade, research and charities. "The EU can and should do more to combat food waste effectively," said EU auditors The auditors concluded that while food waste could be combated through a number of EU policies, this potential is not exploited.
The way forward is still fragmented and inconsistent, and coordination at Commission level is inadequate.
Our report highlighted a number of untapped opportunities and potential improvements that would not require new legislation or additional public funding, and recommended that auditors better adapt existing policies and set a clear policy goal of reducing food waste.
The report was submitted to the Committee of the European Parliament on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as to the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the EU and a number of national parliaments throughout the EU.
Both the European Parliament and the Council welcomed the report and agreed with the conclusions contained therein.
The report also received a considerable response from the media, in particular social media.
Our Activities 18 Special Report: The Commission's role in the Greek financial crisis Greece needed support to ensure its financial stability The 2008 financial crisis followed an economic downturn and a debt crisis in Europe, which exposed the weaknesses of the Greek economy.
In April 2010, Greece was no longer able to finance itself in a sustainable manner on the financial markets, and so requested financial assistance from the euro area Member States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Since then, Greece has participated in three economic adjustment programmes managed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, the so-called Troika.
The third programme also involved the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
The total amount of support of EUR 368.6 billion was linked to political constraints set jointly by the Greek authorities and the lenders.
These programmes aimed at stabilising the economic situation in Greece by meeting the financial needs of the Greek economy, thereby preventing the crisis from spreading to the rest of the euro area.
In return, Greece committed itself to carrying out far-reaching structural reforms.
The EU auditors examined whether the Commission had adequately managed the economic adjustment programmes This review is part of the series of audits carried out by the Court over the past years on the measures and reforms initiated in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
Our auditors assessed how the Commission was dealing with the first two programmes for Greece and how the third programme had been designed.
They reviewed the documents on EU financial assistance programmes, analysed the programme conditions and interviewed Commission staff, national authorities (such as specialist ministries), the Bank of Greece, business associations and stakeholders, as well as IMF, ESM and OECD staff. "Economic adjustment programmes for Greece: despite shortcomings, progress in the reform process, so EU auditors Our auditors concluded that the economic adjustment programmes for Greece had provided financial stability in the short term and made progress in the reform process possible.
However, the programmes in Greece have only brought about a limited recovery.
In addition, the auditors found that the Commission had no experience in managing such a process, that the conditions of the programmes were neither sufficiently prioritized by importance nor embedded in a broader strategy for Greece, and that the macroeconomic assumptions of the programmes were on clay feet.
This special report was submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and to institutional stakeholders in Greece.
The report was the subject of comprehensive media coverage and achieved the largest media response from all the special reports we published in 2017.

Our activities 20 Youth Employment Court Conference – addressing challenges and finding solutions 10 May 2017, European Parliament, Brussels This conference was organised after the publication of our Special Report on the Youth Guarantee, which – as in other reports – examined the effectiveness of EU policies in addressing the problem of youth unemployment in the EU Member States.
During the conference, Iliana Ivanova, the rapporteur, and the auditors discussed with senior representatives of EU institutions, employment agencies and young people whether EU policies should deliver results and how best to proceed in the future.
Court Conference on EU Actions in the Energy and Climate Change 17 October 2017, European Parliament, Brussels This conference was an integral part of our work on the Landscape Analysis on EU Actions in the Energy and Climate Change sectors, which we published in September 2017 and later presented at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn.
The Court's conference provided a platform for stakeholders and key actors in this area, both public and private, to discuss future challenges.
It was organised jointly by the Court and the European Parliament's Scientific Service.
The conference was opened by Phil Wynn Owen, the rapporteur, and Jerzy Buzek, chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
The conference was attended by representatives of Member States, EU institutions, Supreme Audit Institutions, non-governmental organisations and think tanks, as well as members of the European Parliament (MEP), scientists and our auditors.

Our activities 21 Court Symposium on Regulatory Impact Assessment November 23, 2017, European Court of Auditors, Luxembourg About 100 representatives of universities, think tanks, research centres, international organisations as well as European, national and regional institutions attended the two-day symposium in which the subject of regulatory impact assessment was discussed.
During the symposium, contributions were presented and discussed, which had been submitted by the participants in an open call.
The symposium was chaired by Danièle Lamarque, a member of the Court, and organized in collaboration with the scientific journal "Politiques et management public".
This is crucial because the impact of our work largely depends on the benefit these recipients derive from our audit results and recommendations.
It is therefore also important that we take into account their concerns and proposals in the planning of our annual work programme.
European Parliament In February 2017, President Klaus-Heiner Lehne presented the Court's work programme for 2017 to the parliamentary body that coordinates the work of the committees of the European Parliament (Conference of Committee Chairs).
It invited all Parliament's standing committees to propose possible audit tasks for the 2018 work programme.
Three quarters of the parliamentary committees submitted proposals, of which we have now taken account of about two-thirds in our work.
Exchange of views with the Conference of the Presidencies of the European Parliament chaired by Cecilia Wikström
Our activities 22 In April 2017, President Lehne took part in the debate in the plenary session of the European Parliament on the discharge procedure for 2015.

Our management 28 Strategy The next three years will be a crucial period for the European Union in which essential decisions must be taken.
We are aware that EU citizens need access to clear and reliable information so that the EU can successfully address the challenges facing them.
Citizens must be able to see that the EU is acting with integrity, upholding the rule of law, prudently using taxpayers' money, pursuing clear objectives and achieving the results it has promised.
We, as external auditors of the EU, can make a contribution to this.
Our strategy for 2018-2020: strengthening trust through external financial control In July 2017, we published our strategy for the period 2018-2020, in which we set four strategic objectives: • communicating clear statements to our audience; • focusing more on the performance aspects of EU action; • improving the added value of the Statement of Assurance; • aligning our overall organisation with our products.
Ultimately, the EU is not about figures, but about people Through external financial control exercised by the Court, the Court can show what works and what does not work in the EU's expenditure and activities, it can help EU citizens to answer the question of whether the EU institutions provide them with results and thus help to strengthen confidence in the EU.
In this respect, the Court's audits must also address the concerns of European citizens, its most important addressees at last.
The 2018-2020 strategy identifies five priority areas for the Court's work in the coming years.
Sustainable management of natural resources and combating climate change Investments for cohesion, growth and integration Challenges related to migration, security and global sustainable development A functioning internal market and a stable monetary union Financing and management of the Union while respecting accountability and economic efficiency
Our management 29 In the course of developing our strategy, we placed strong emphasis on internal and external consultation.
We discussed the strategy with our staff and addressed members of the European Parliament, representatives of EU Member States, the European Commission, other supreme audit authorities and non-institutional stakeholders such as scientists, think tanks, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private sector auditors.
The Court's strategy for 2018-2020 is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Work planning In January 2017, we decided to launch new work plan procedures, which we applied for the first time to our annual work programme for 2018, which was published in October last year.
The main changes in our work planning: • drawing up a list of audit tasks for the whole Court; • centralised procedure for the selection of audit ideas, possible audit tasks and final audit proposals; • more flexible allocation of resources to and distribution of resources between the different audit chambers, taking into account the workload; • extension of the product range to include audit tasks resulting from analysis-based publications; • definition of high-priority audit tasks for which shorter deadlines apply.
In addition, we agreed with the Conference of the Committee Chairs of the European Parliament a procedure in which all Parliament's standing committees can propose potential audit topics to the Court.
The Court's 2018 work programme is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Performance Measurement In the period 2013-2017, we used seven Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to inform management of the progress made with regard to our goals, support the decision-making process and provide our users with information about our performance.
The indicators were used to measure core parameters regarding the quality and impact of our work, taking into account the position of key stakeholders and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of resources.
A revised set of performance indicators, valid for the period 2018-2020, will be introduced in 2018.
Quality and impact of our work We evaluated the quality and impact of our reports on the basis of assessments by addressees and expert reviews. Another evaluation criterion was the follow-up to our recommendations to improve EU financial management.
Our management 30 Appraisals from recipients We asked our main institutional addressees and peers – the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets, the Council's Committee on Budgets, the main audited bodies at the Commission and the European Agencies, as well as the Presidents of the EU ORCB – to evaluate our reports.
Similar to previous years, the vast majority of respondents assessed the relevance and impact of our reports in 2017 as "high or "very high".
Expert reviews Every year, independent external experts review the content and presentation of a sample of our reports to assess their quality.
In 2017, the auditors assessed six special reports* and the annual reports for the financial year 2016.
They assessed the quality of various aspects of the reports on the basis of a four-stage scale of "significantly impaired" (1) to "high-quality" (4).
The results have changed only slightly in recent years, with the quality of our reports being "satisfactory". * In 2017, the reviewers assessed our special reports No. 3/2017, No. 4/2017, No. 5/2017, No. 10/2017, No. 14/2017 and No. 17/2017.

Our management 31 Follow-up of recommendations During the year, we systematically reviewed the extent to which our recommendations had been implemented by the audited bodies.
By the end of 2017, this was the case with 92% of the recommendations we made in 2014.
100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Implementation of the Court's recommendations after the year of the tax 92 % 80% 59% 53% 2014 2015 2016 2017 The Court in the media 31% 4% 65% The Court Annual Reports Special Reports in the general media presence In addition, we follow the media reports about our work and our institution.
In 2017, 65% of the references in the online media that related to our work and our institution were related to special reports.
Overall, the number of media reports on our special reports increased by 11% compared to 2016.
The Court's reports, which received the largest media response in 2017, were the special reports on the Greek financial crisis, registration centres for migrants (hotspots), fisheries control, greening and the Natura 2000 network.
Our management 32 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 Special Reports of the Court – average number of online articles per Special Report 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 The increase in media reports on our Special Reports in 2017 is in line with a trend that has been observed for several years.
While less than 1,500 online articles were published in 2013, this number increased to almost 7,000 in 2017, with the average number of articles written per special report rising from an average of less than 30 in 2013 to almost 130 in 2017.
The biggest media response was our special report on the Greek financial crisis, which deals with over 2,000 online articles and contributions on social media resources As part of our performance measurement, we also evaluate our resource use, in particular our ability to carry out audits in a timely manner, implement our work programme and ensure the expertise of our employees.
Examination period In 2017, an average of 14.6 months passed from the start of an audit task to the adoption of a special report.
This is the shortest processing time since the beginning of the period 2013-2017.
For the preparation of eight reports (29%) published during the year, we needed less than 13 months.
It took an average of 16 months to publish the reports, about two months less than in 2016.
This positive trend indicates that the measures will bear fruit in achieving the 13-month objective set out in the Financial Regulation.

Our Management 33 Publication of Reports In 2017, 65% of our special reports were published in accordance with the original plan.
The remaining reports have been postponed and will be published in 2018.
In addition, our annual reports and all special annual reports have been published as planned.
Professional Training In accordance with the recommendations published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), we strive to provide every auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training per year.
In 2017, we were once again above this target with 6.7 training days per examiner.
If the language courses necessary for the efficient work of our auditors in all EU Member States are also taken into account, an auditor accounted for an average of 8.3 training days in 2017.
For the other employees, we have set ourselves the goal of providing on average 16 hours (two days) of professional training (without language courses).
In 2017, this target was met with an average of 2.3 training days.

Our staff 34 Human resources allocation In 2017, we completed the 5 % reduction of staff planned for a period of five years (2013-2017), as defined in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of December 2013.
At the end of 2017, 853 officials and temporary staff worked at the Court. 548 of them worked in the examination chambers, including 118 employees in the members' cabinets.
Recruitment The staff of the Court have a broad academic and professional background.
With our recruitment policy, we follow the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and promote equal opportunities at all levels.
Staff include both officials and temporary staff.
General selection procedures are usually organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In 2017, the Court hired 72 staff: 29 officials, 13 temporary staff, 24 contract staff (of whom seven left the Court by the end of the year) and six seconded national experts.
We also provided 71 university graduates with internships for periods of three to five months.

Our employees 35 Age profile The age profile of the active staff on 31 December 2017 shows that almost half of our employees are 44 years old or younger.
31 of the 68 directors and executive managers of the Court (46%) are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, in the next five to ten years, when these employees retire, there will be a renewal in senior management positions.
Balance between men and women The Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities relating to all stages of the career of its employees.
Overall, we have achieved a balanced proportion of men and women among our employees; 43% of our auditors and boards are women.
In recent years, we have managed to increase the proportion of women in management positions in our examination chambers from 7% in 2015 to almost 20% in 2017.
We continue to strive to achieve a balance between men and women at all levels of management.
In addition, our policy on equal opportunities for the period 2018-2020 concerns issues related to age and disability.
More detailed information on the nationality and gender of managers is given in the table below.

In 2017, we further expanded our training offering, including an increase in the number of courses in the areas of e-learning and integrated learning (blended learning).
We continued our successful series of presentations, held by internal or external experts on audit developments and other topics related to the work of our auditors.
We also organised several training sessions and events in which experts from other Supreme Audit Institutions provided knowledge and good practices regarding accounting audits and audits.
A good example of this is the annual "Training Day", which we organised in November 2017 in cooperation with the University of Luxembourg and which was attended by more than 300 employees.
We work closely with the European Commission, the European Institute for Public Administration (EIPA) and the European Administration Academy (EUSA) to provide our employees with a wide range of training courses, including exam courses and courses for developing personal skills as well as work-related language courses.
In addition, we helped our employees to acquire or maintain professional qualifications and qualifications in the areas relevant to the role and work of the Court.
In particular, we continued our cooperation with the University of Lorraine (Nancy, France), within the framework of which the postgraduate program "Audit of public organisations and policies" and the master program "Management of public organisations" are offered.
We also signed a cooperation agreement with the European University Institute (EHI) in Florence, Italy.
In 2017, we established a partnership with the University of Pisa (Italy) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accoun-tants (ACCA) to organise a summer course in the field of public financial control and accountability.
Last year, we awarded the best submitted contribution with the award 2016 by the Court for scientific work in the field of audit in the public sector.
37 We continued our "Performance Recognition Awards" program, which allows non-managerial staff to participate in specific external training.
Translation The Directorate for Translations, Language Services and Publication of the Court translated and revised more than 211 000 pages.
We continued our efforts to streamline translation and reduce the associated costs.
For example, all our translation teams are now using a collaborative work platform to increase efficiency.
We are striving to involve our translators increasingly in our core activities and to create further synergies with our auditors.
In particular, in 2017 the translators increasingly supported the auditors in the linguistic preparation of the special reports and the annual report.
In addition, they provided our examiners with linguistic support during 38 test visits.
Information technology Our IT directorate makes a decisive contribution to our audit processes by optimising the flow of information using modern and secure technologies.
We have made further progress in document management and have been able to fully digitise production, acceptance and publication processes.
We introduced a simplified tool to facilitate remote access via mobile devices.
We also performed a system upgrade (installation of Windows 10 and SharePoint 2013).
To make even better use of interinstitutional synergies, we introduced new audit, mission and training systems, which are currently being used by other EU institutions.
Support for audit activities 38 buildings The yard currently owns three buildings ("K1", "K2" and "K3") and rents office space for its data recovery centre in Luxembourg.
K1 The K1 building, which was opened in 1988, has offices for up to 310 employees and meeting rooms.
In the basement there are parking spaces, technical facilities, storage rooms, the library and the main archive, while the entire top floor is used for technical installations.
The K1 building was modernised in 2008 to bring it into line with national health, safety and environmental requirements.
As far as possible, the technology in the K1 building was adapted to achieve compatibility with the buildings K2 and K3.
Thus, the three buildings form a single integrated technical unit.
K2 The K2 building was opened in 2003.
Parking, technical facilities, storage rooms and the fitness centre are located in the basement.
The entire top floor is used for technical installations.
The remaining floors are used for offices for up to 241 employees, and there are also meeting rooms, a conference room with interpreting booths, video conference rooms, a cafeteria and a basic kitchen area.
The Court commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of setting up activity-related work areas and the modernisation of the K2 technical facilities.
The study shows that the design of the work areas could be improved and that some technical facilities have to be modernised.
A detailed study of this project will be carried out in 2018 and work is expected to begin in 2019.
As approved by the Council and the European Parliament in March 2014, the Court will use the remaining resources of the K3 construction project completed a few years ago to finance this modernisation.

The basements have parking spaces, technical facilities, storage rooms, unloading areas, waste storage facilities, printing houses, kitchens and archives.
The ground floor consists of the canteen, a cafeteria and training rooms.
In addition, there are offices for 503 employees, meeting rooms and an IT room in this building.
On the sixth floor there are reception rooms, a kitchen and technical facilities.
Based on the world's leading method for assessing and certifying the sustainability of buildings (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, BREEAM), the K3 building was rated "very good".
Project for Safety at Work In 2017, the project aimed at strengthening the safety of the farm and its employees was continued as planned.
The new security control centre, the external accreditation centre and access control centre for employees and visitors will be put into operation in 2018.
Environmental management As an institution of the European Union, we consider it our duty to follow the principle of sound environmental management in all activities, and we strive to continuously reduce the environmental impact of the Court.
In 2017, we received the Eco Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).
We now successfully operate an EMAS-compliant environmental management system and fully meet the certification requirements of ISO 14001:2015.
Our goal is to systematically reduce our CO2 emissions.
In 2017, we analyzed – for the third year in a row – the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our activities (i.e. our carbon footprint).
The results of this study are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Accountability of the 40 Court Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union, with its budget falling within the area of administrative expenditure.
In 2017, the Court's budget amounted to around 141 million euros.
This represents less than 0.1% of total EU expenditure and around 1.5% of total EU administrative expenditure.
The share of the 2017 budget appropriations used was 98%.

Court's accountability 42 Risk management During the year, we reviewed risk assessments for each Directorate, as required by the Financial Regulation.
The results of these checks shall be incorporated into the annual statement by the authorising officer by delegation in the Annual Activity Report and shall be used for the risk assessments of the following year.
As far as necessary, we prepared action plans for ex ante and ex post controls.
In September 2017, after carrying out these checks, we strengthened internal controls and financial procedures related to travel expenses and the management of service vehicles.
Internal and external audit Internal audit The Internal Audit Service advises the Court on risk management issues.
It shall deliver opinions on the quality of administrative and internal control systems and report to a Committee on Internal Audit, composed of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee regularly monitors the progress made in the various tasks set out in the annual work programme of the Internal Audit Service and ensures the independence of the Office.
In 2017, the department examined the implementation of the Court's 2013-2017 strategy, the operational structure of the President's Services Directorate and the management of our software licenses and products.
It also examined the implementation of the Court's risk management policy and monitored the implementation of its recommendations to ensure that the action plans take shape.
The Internal Auditor considers that in 2017, the existing governance, risk management and internal control procedures as a whole provide sufficient assurance that the Court's objectives will be achieved.
We report annually to Parliament and to the Council on the results of the internal audit work.
External audit Our financial statements are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same transparency and accountability principles to itself as to the bodies it reviews.
The auditor's report – PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à r.l. – on the Court's financial statements for the financial year 2016 was published on 31 October 2017.
Discharge Like the other EU institutions, the Court is subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2017, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2015.
This means that our financial statements for 2015 were finally approved.
As in every year, we have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our audit and management responsibility, taken appropriate measures and reported to the European Parliament on our follow-up.
Court's annual accounts 43 Audit opinions of the independent auditor – Financial year 2016 On the Court's annual accounts: "According to our assessment, the financial statements give an actual picture of the European Court of Auditors' assets and financial position as at 31 December 2016 and its earnings, cash flows and changes in net assets for the year ending that reference date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the Union's general budget and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 347, 31.12.2012, p.
1), hereinafter referred to as the "Budget", and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of the Financial Regulation.
Declaration by the Plenipotentiary 44 Authorising Officer I, the undersigned Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, hereby declare in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation that the information contained in this report is accurate and accurate and confirms with sufficient certainty that the funds provided for the activities described in this report have been used for the purposes provided and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, that the control procedures established provide the necessary assurance of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and that the costs and benefits of the controls are proportionate to the appropriate handling of fraud or suspected fraud.
This security is based on the assessment of the undersigned and the information available to him, such as the reports and statements of authorising officers by subdelegation, the internal auditor's reports and the independent auditor's audit reports on previous financial years.

European Court of Auditors 4 About the Court The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the external auditor of the European Union.
It was established in 1977 and is one of the seven institutions of the EU.
The Court is based in Luxembourg and employs around 900 staff of all EU nationalities, composed of auditors and staff in horizontal services and administration.
The College of the Court shall be composed of one member from each EU Member State.
The Court's tasks The Court checks that the EU ensures proper accounting, that its financial rules are correctly applied and that its policies and programmes achieve the desired objectives and that the best use is made of resources.
Through its audit work, the Court contributes to improving the financial management of the EU and to promoting accountability and transparency.
The Court submits its observations and recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, national governments and parliaments and to the general public.
Foreword of the President 5 Dear reader, dear reader!
We are now increasingly focusing on assessing the performance of EU measures, conveying our statements to the Court's addressees in a clear form and increasing the value of our work for our stakeholders.
In this activity report, we provide an overview of our work in 2018, in which we published the highest number of special reports, analyses and opinions so far.
You will also find information about our employees, our management and our finances.
Our reports offer an impartial assessment of the Union's policies and programmes and the quality of EU financial management within and outside the European Union.
We are examining whether EU expenditure is in line with the rules and whether the Union's policies and programmes ensure optimal use of funds.
We will be pleased to work with the newly elected European Parliament and the new European Commission to further improve EU financial management and ensure that the EU achieves results.
In this report, our determination to continue to adapt the Court's organisation in order to "equip us for the future" and to continue to help shape developments in the field of public sector audit.

Our activities Strategy 2018 is the first year of our current strategy, covering the period up to and including 2020.
Our strategic objectives for this three-year period are: o to improve the added value of the Statement of Assurance with a view to the current EU financial management, o to increase the focus on the performance aspects of EU action, o to provide clear statements for our audience.
In addition, we have agreed to align our overall organisation even better with our products.
In order to implement our strategy, we have agreed an action plan for these objectives in order to continue to be among the frontrunners in developments in the field of public sector audit.
All these measures were in progress at the end of 2018.
At the same time, we have already commissioned an independent peer review process for the implementation of our strategy. The expert review should be completed at the end of 2019 – further information in the chapter on the Court's accountability.
Progress towards achieving our strategic objectives 7
The focus – communication activity around our products Communicating clear statements to our audience Communication is crucial if we are to achieve our strategic goal of conveying clear statements to our audience, which consists of the political bodies of the EU and the Member States responsible for the control and management of the policies and programmes of the Union, of the other Supreme Audit Institutions, of companies and industry organisations, of scientists and not least of the general public – our most important stakeholder.
In 2018, we saw the media's interest in our work.
Above all, our special reports met with great interest in the media and were also discussed more and more in national and EU-oriented media channels – further information on this in the chapter on media presence.
In 2018, we published 12 audit previews (previously referred to as "background papers") designed to serve as a source of information for all those interested in specific policy areas or programmes to which audits are under way.
The information presented here is based on the preparatory work prior to the start of an ongoing examination task.
Audit previews have contributed to the stable and balanced output of Court publications throughout the year: 2018 was the first year in which there was not a single month without the publication of the ECA.
We will continue to publish this type of communication products in 2019. 8
Journal While our findings and recommendations for improving EU financial management are set out in our audit reports, the Court Journal focuses on our way of working and our staff who report on various areas.
Now each issue is dedicated to a different overarching theme.
In 2018, the Court's journal targeted a wide range of topics, such as EU pre-accession assistance, the financing and audit of Parliament and the financial and economic governance of the EU, as well as our special reports, our work programme, our international cooperation and our forward-looking measures, with the aim of "equiping the Court" for the future.

Audits More focused on performance We carry out various types of audits in the different areas of the EU budget: o Economic audits – Consider the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of EU policies and programmes.The focus of these audits on optimal use of funds is on specific management or budget issues.
In selecting and designing these audit tasks, the Court shall consider the risks to the economy or compliance, the level of the revenue or expenditure concerned, as well as the political and public interest; o Audits of the accounts and compliance audits – This shall consider the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying financial operations, in particular in the context of the Statement of Assurance, and whether the systems in specific budgetary areas comply with the rules.
Our random sampling procedure ensures the same probability of testing for each euro spent.
Our reviews focus on issues that reflect EU-relevant issues such as the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources, growth and inclusion, challenges associated with migration and global development, the internal market and banking union, and ensuring the accountability and economic efficiency of the European Union.
On the basis of the evidence obtained during our audit work, our reports draw clear conclusions on the extent to which the EU's policy objectives have been achieved, as well as on the state of the Union's budgetary and financial management.
Our audits are in line with internationally accepted auditing principles for the public sector.
The examination work is divided into the following phases: 10
PLANTING Determining the usefulness and feasibility of a proposed audit.
On-site audit work Multi-disciplinary teams shall gather on-site audit evidence in the Commission's central services as well as in Member States and recipient countries.
VERSION 03 04 05 06 11 01 02 Clear, structured presentation of the main findings and conclusions.
CLARification Confirmation of facts and findings by the audited body.
Acceptance of the report by the Chamber of Examining or the entire College of Court.
PUBLICATION Publication of the special report in 23 official languages together with the reply of the audited body.
Work planning Audit priorities are based on the EU's main concerns Our work programme is decided annually by the members of the Court.
In January 2018, President Lehne presented the 2018 work programme to the Conference of Committee Chairs of the European Parliament and asked all parliamentary committees to propose potential audit topics for the 2019 work programme as part of the annual stakeholder consultations.
12 In October 2018, we published the first work programme prepared in accordance with the new strategy. In this work programme for 2019, we presented in detail our audit priorities and the 36 reports and analysis-based products that are planned to be published this year.
These tasks covered, at least in part, 29 of the 69 proposals submitted by Parliament (42%) (2017: 32%).
Our audits will continue to focus on key issues such as the sustainable use of natural resources, growth and inclusion, migration, security and global development, the internal market and the accountability and economic viability of the EU to determine whether the EU has achieved what it has promised.
On-site examinations 3 761 days of examination work – within and outside the EU The majority of our examination work takes place in the premises of the Court in Luxembourg.
At the same time, our auditors also carry out numerous audit visits to the European Commission – the most important body audited by the Court – including the other EU institutions, agencies and bodies, the EU delegations, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States, and international organisations to which EU funds are allocated.
We also conduct on-the-spot audits of beneficiaries of EU funds within and outside the European Union.
Through these audits, we can track the audit path and obtain direct audit evidence from the bodies involved in the management of Union policies and programmes and the collection or disbursement of EU funds, as well as from the respective beneficiaries. 13
The frequency and intensity of our audit work in the individual Member States and recipient countries depend on the type of audit we carry out.
In 2018, our auditors spent 3,761 days (2017: 3,670 days) with on-site inspections in Member States and outside the EU.
Within the EU, our on-site audits are often carried out in conjunction with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States visited.
In addition, our auditors spent 2,723 days (2017: 2,300 days) with the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as with decentralised agencies and bodies throughout the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations or the OECD, as well as with audit firms.
To obtain and validate audit evidence, we are increasingly making use of video conferencing and other information technologies, such as the secure exchange of data and documents. 14

Combating fraud at the expense of the EU budget Nine cases of suspected fraud In combating fraud at the expense of the EU budget, we work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
These cases will then be followed up by OLAF, which will decide on possible investigations and, if necessary, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
Although our tests are not specifically designed to detect fraud, we occasionally encounter cases in which we suspect irregularities or fraudulent activities.
In 2018, we forwarded nine such cases (2017: 13 cases), in which there was a suspicion of fraud, to OLAF.
Additional information on the nature of suspected fraud transmitted to OLAF and on the resulting recoveries, as recommended by OLAF, can be found in our annual reports on the general budget of the EU. 16
Publications New record: highest number of publications in 2018 Our audit reports, analyses and opinions form an important link in the EU's accountability chain.
They help the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to monitor and verify whether the EU achieves its policy objectives and to hold the bodies responsible for the budget management of the EU accountable, in particular within the framework of the annual discharge procedure.
This is primarily the European Commission, but also the other EU institutions and bodies.
National, regional and local authorities in the Member States also play an important role in areas of shared management where the bulk of the EU budget is spent, including agricultural and cohesion measures.

Special Reports We assess the performance of EU action in our Special Reports In line with our strategy for 2018-2020, we are increasingly focusing on assessing the performance of EU action to ensure that EU citizens' resources are used optimally.
In 2018, we published 35 special reports (2017: 28 special reports) on the various areas of EU expenditure in which we addressed the challenges facing the EU, such as air pollution, the high-speed rail network, the Facility for Refugees in Turkey, banking supervision and the financing of non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
In these special reports, we examine whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved in an effective and economic way, and whether the EU funds have provided added value – i.e. whether they have achieved more than can be achieved by action alone at national level.
We also make recommendations on financial savings, better working methods, avoiding waste or more cost-effective achievement of the policy objectives.
At this point, we will examine two of our 2018 special reports: a special report on high-speed rail transport in the EU and one on the Facility for Refugees in Turkey.
In line with the EU Financial Regulation, we strive to produce our special reports within 13 months. 20

Special report in focus European high-speed rail network: not a reality, but an ineffective patchwork High-speed rail transport has many advantages for passengers.
It is a convenient, safe, flexible and environmentally sustainable mode of transport.
Improving links between regions in the EU will also make them more competitive and contribute to European integration by bringing people closer to each other.
In this way we analyzed the various connections, travel times and prices for business and private travellers.
We also examined whether the co-financed investments in high-speed rail lines were cost-effective and effective, as well as well thought out and planned.
The Court concluded that the European high-speed rail network was merely an inefficient patchwork of lines in each Member State, which were insufficiently interconnected.
There is no realistic long-term plan for connecting the various parts of the existing EU network; high-speed lines crossing national borders are not among the priorities of each Member State, and the European Commission does not have the powers to force Member States to do so.
In such circumstances, EU co-financing for high-speed rail transport will achieve low added value.
However, there is also a good news: the number of passengers using high-speed rail in Europe is growing steadily, with an increase from about 15 billion passenger kilometres in 1990 to more than 124 billion in 2016.
Both institutions welcomed the report and agreed with our conclusions.
We also presented it to numerous national authorities and SAIs as well as researchers, industry stakeholders and the media.
Throughout the EU, the media, in particular EU-oriented media and financial media, have been involved in this report, especially in Spain and Germany.

Special report in focus The Facility for Refugees in Turkey: Support is helpful, but optimal use of funds can only be achieved with improvements Turkey has received as many refugees as no other country in the world, with almost 4 million people.
About 3.5 million of these refugees are Syrians, most of whom live outside refugee camps.
Support under the Facility for Refugees in Turkey, which has been endowed with a total of EUR 6 billion by the EU and its Member States, covers humanitarian and non-Humanitarian activities for refugees and host communities.
As part of the political agreement, Turkey was required to end irregular migration from Turkey to the EU.
The humanitarian projects have been able to meet the basic needs of refugees, but in some cases the expected optimal use of funds or the objective of the facility, an effective coordination of this support, has not been achieved.
The humanitarian projects audited provided helpful support for the refugees.
For example, the social security network for emergency situations helped 1.3 million refugees through cash aid.
However, half of the projects have not yet achieved the expected effects – a lasting positive impact that can be sustained without further financial support – and nine out of ten projects had to be extended.
The timely implementation of projects managed by NGOs was primarily hampered by the difficult working environment.
This was due to the refusal by the Turkish authorities to provide access to the data of the eligible beneficiaries of the two cash support projects in our sample, totalling EUR 1.1 billion.
We presented our report at a joint meeting attended by the Development Committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, and subsequently also the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
It was also presented to the Enlargement and Candidate Countries Group of the Council of the EU and the press.
In Germany in particular, this report has attracted great media interest, but also in Denmark, Austria, the Benelux countries and the Mediterranean countries, as well as in the EU-oriented media.

Annual reports Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2017 Annual accounts drawn up, full audit opinion on revenue, limited audit opinion on expenditure Every year, we examine the revenue and expenditure of the EU budget and examine whether the annual accounts are reliable and the revenue and expenditure operations are in line with the financial rules at EU and Member State level.
In addition, we will specifically assess all important areas of the EU budget – on the basis of the headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020 – and provide information on budgetary and financial management as well as performance-related information.
Furthermore, we analyse why errors have occurred, make recommendations on possible improvements and examine whether and to what extent our previous recommendations have been put into practice.
As part of our latest annual report on the EU budget for the 2017 financial year, our auditors examined a sample of around 700 payments worth a total of EUR 100 billion to beneficiaries in the various areas of expenditure of the EU budget.
This means that we analysed some 700 different cases where EU funds were used to support important infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in the EU Member States or to support beneficiaries in non-EU countries.
26 Key data EU expenditures 2017 137.4 billion euros Audited amount 100.2 billion euros (703 payment transactions) Accounting According to actual circumstances – reliability confirms revenue Legally and properly – full audit opinion Expenditure Except for reimbursements lawfully and properly – limited (and no failed) audit opinion
Downward trend in estimated error rates continues This extensive work forms the basis for our Statement of Assurance, which we must submit to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with our mandate set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The Court gave an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the revenue of the EU, as in previous years.
In addition, for the second year in a row, we were able to present a limited (and not a failed) assessment of EU expenditure.
A significant part of the expenditure audited in 2017 did not have a significant error rate.
In addition, the estimated error rate for payments in 2017 was 2.4%, compared to 3.1% in 2016 and 3.8% in 2015.
Parliament's discharge procedure kicks off The publication of our annual report is at the beginning of the discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament, in which the EU legislative and budgetary authority, on the recommendation of the Council, decides whether the Commission and other bodies have managed the EU budget satisfactorily.
We presented our annual report to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control on 4 October at the same time as it was published and subsequently also to the plenary of the European Parliament and the ECOFIN Council, as well as to the national parliaments and authorities of 14 Member States.
Mr Lehne, President of the European Court of Auditors, and Mr Lazarou, Member of the Court, at the presentation of our annual report at the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2018 28
For cohesion expenditure, we assessed the 2014-2020 control and reliability framework and the reliability of the information provided by the Commission to demonstrate regularity.
This was a first step towards the potential design of the Statement of Assurance as a test-oriented audit.
With the revised approach and the transition to a testat-oriented audit, we generally intend to take greater account of the different internal control levels at the European Commission and the Member States' authorities responsible for managing EU expenditure.
This makes it clearer where weaknesses persist both within the European Commission and in the Member States, enabling us to contribute to promoting accountability and further improving EU financial management.
This approach shall only apply where the relevant requirements laid down in international auditing principles are complied with. 29
Annual report on the European Development Funds Cancelled audit opinion on payments Under the European Development Fund (EDF), the European Union provides support for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the overseas countries and territories.
The EDFs are financed by the Member States of the Union and managed outside the EU budget by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank.
Key data on our audit opinions on EDFs are set out below.
Special annual reports Agencies and other bodies Unrestricted opinion on all EU agencies other than one EU agencies have their headquarters all over Europe and employ around 11,000 staff.
The 2017 budget of all agencies combined – with the exception of the Single Resolution Committee (SRB) – amounted to EUR 3.5 billion, representing approximately 2.7% of the total EU budget.
The SRB's 2017 budget, financed by contributions from credit institutions, amounted to 6.6 billion euros.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London, which is moving to Amsterdam New approach: a single report on all 41 EU agencies In 2018, we decided to present the results of our audit of the accounts in EU agencies in a more user-friendly format.
While we continued to provide individual statements of assurance for each agency, we published a single annual report on all agencies, including a summary document entitled "Short Information on the Review of EU Agencies".
As every year, we have also published our annual reports on the European Schools and the contingent liabilities of the SRB, the Commission and the Council. 31
Seats of agencies in the Member States 32 * Following the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the EU, the Council decided to move the EMA and the EBA to Amsterdam and Paris in 2019.
Joint Undertakings Unrestricted review judgement for all European Joint Research Undertakings other than a Joint Undertaking are EU public-private partnerships with industry, research groups and Member States, which play an important role in implementing certain aspects of EU research policy.
The European Commission is the member of the Joint Undertaking and represents the EU.
Private members include various partners from industry and research.
One of the main objectives of the Joint Undertakings is to attract contributions from members of the private industry and the research sector, which is their added value.
33 Main conclusions Overall, our review of the agencies confirmed the positive results from previous years for the year ending 31 December 2017.
We gave o full audit opinions on the reliability of the accounts for all agencies; o full audit opinions on the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the annual accounts of all agencies; o full audit opinions on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts of all agencies, with the exception of a failed audit opinion for the European Asylum Support Office, which identified a number of problems.
Main conclusions o We have drawn up the accounts of all EU Joint Undertakings for the financial year 2017 and confirmed their reliability. o Seven Joint Undertakings have received full audit opinions on their revenue and payment transactions; the Joint Undertaking "Electronic Components and Systems for Europe's Leadership" has received a limited audit opinion as auditors have identified problems that in some cases have been countered by effective internal control.
Opinions We also contribute to improving the EU's fiscal governance by publishing opinions on Commission proposals for new or amended legislation.
If these are acts with significant financial implications, the Court's opinions are required under EU law.
These are mainly used by the legislative authority – the European Parliament and the Council – in their work.
Opinions may also be launched at the request of other institutions or at the Court's own initiative.
In 2018, we published ten opinions – the highest number so far – on various areas of EU governance.
On the one hand, these mainly concerned the Commission's legislative proposals for the new MFF, such as the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and its cooperation with the future European Public Prosecutor's Office (EUStA), and the link between EU funding and respect for the rule of law and the protection of whistleblowers.
Focus – opinion on CAP reform A more environmentally friendly and consistently performance-driven CAP, which focuses more on accountability When the European Commission published its legislative proposal for the new CAP after 2020, it stressed that environmental and climate objectives would be given a very high priority.
However, in our opinion on the reform of the CAP, we pointed out that many of the policy options proposed differed only slightly from the current CAP regime.
In particular, most of the budget will continue to be direct payments to farmers based on the number of own or used hectares.
We also noted that this instrument is not the most economical way to support adequate income and that it does not take into account many environmental concerns.
Moreover, the Commission's assessment of the CAP's contribution to the EU's climate change objectives seemed unrealistic; therefore, the Court recommends more environmentally friendly and consistently performance-based plans for the next CAP, which should also focus more on accountability. 34
In accordance with the procedure we apply in our reports, this opinion was presented to the committees of the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council, the stakeholders in the environmental and agricultural sectors and the press. 35
Analysis-based publications: Landscape analyses, thematic papers and rapid case reviews Analytical overview of publicly available information and the Court's own work Landscape analyses In 2018, we produced two landscape analyses.
In the first, the Court examined the application of Union law in practice and explained that the Commission's supervisory activities should be strengthened with regard to the application of Union law by the Member States.
In the second Landscape analysis, we dealt with mobility and transport and assessed it as the cornerstone of European integration.
However, we expressed concerns about the investment deficit, as the modernisation of the EU transport network is being slowed down by the decline in investment in transport infrastructure.
Topic papers In 2018, we published a total of six thematic papers: five on the Commission's proposals for the future MFF and one on the integration of migrants in the EU.
The Court's comments on the MFF focused in particular on the proposed procedure for setting the EU's expenditure priorities, the flexibility of the EU budget, performance orientation and administrative simplification, and accountability and audit rules.
We welcomed the Commission's efforts to modernise the EU budget after 2020, but at the same time identified several potential risks, identified a number of weaknesses and proposed concrete improvements.
We pointed out that effective parliamentary control of sound accountability rules is needed and that the Court should in principle be designated as an external auditor for all bodies set up by the EU.
Rapid Case Reviews In the only rapid analysis we presented in 2018 on cohesion, we noted that VAT reimbursement is prone to error and does not always represent an optimal use of EU funds.
We felt that the refund of VAT to public authorities should no longer be possible for expenditure co-financed by the EU in the period after 2020. 36
Conference on financial instruments In January 2018, we held a joint high-level conference on EU financial instruments in Vilnius in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Lithuania.
The event gave high-level experts from EU institutions and Lithuanian institutions, experts and other public and private stakeholders the opportunity to share their views and ideas.
Symposium on the Public Financing of Parliaments In March 2018, the Court hosted a two-day international symposium on the public financing of Parliaments in Europe to discuss their autonomy and the analysis of the budgetary systems of the EU Member States.
Global Audit Leadership Forum In April 2018, we hosted the fifth meeting of the Global Audit Leadership Forum, where the presidents and representatives of around twenty Supreme Audit Institutions from around the world met.
The main issues discussed were the practice and limits of the economic assessment in the political context as well as the challenges and opportunities in the transmission of audit findings in the digital age. 37
38 Fifth meeting of the Global Audit Leadership Forum in April 2018, at which the presidents of around twenty Supreme Audit Institutions from around the world met in the European Court of Auditors Europe Day – EU Open Day In May 2018, we attended the events on the occasion of Europe Day in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg.
At the information booths, visitors could obtain information from our examiners about our role and work and learn first-hand how tests are carried out.
We will continue to organise open days in the European Court of Auditors and participate in public events to get in touch with citizens.
Symposium on Good Public Administration In September 2018, we attended a symposium on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and on public governance entitled "Good Public Administration and Benefits for Citizens – The Role of Parliamentary Control Bodies", organized by the Austrian Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of INTOSAI and the Austrian People's Prosecutor's Office.
Conference on the Application of Union Law In September 2018, we hosted a conference on the application of Union law at which, followed by our Landscape Analysis on the Application of Union law in practice, the need for accountability, transparency and scrutiny was discussed.
This event was held at the Committee of the Regions in Brussels.
Conference on e-commerce and related taxation In October 2018, we hosted a conference on e-commerce and the challenges of taxation in the digital age.
Speakers and panel participants discussed the risks of the current tax model for VAT in e-commerce and suggested alternative tax models aimed at using modern technology, such as blockchain.
Conference of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) In November 2018, we participated in the eighth annual conference of EIOPA in Frankfurt.
The conference brought together more than 400 people from the financial services sector, academia, consumer organisations, the media, international organisations, EU institutions and national authorities.
The Court presented its audit work on supervision and financial stability in the European insurance sector – the subject of the special report on EIOPA in 2018. 39
COP24 In December 2018, we participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice.
We presented our audit work on air quality and its impact on climate change and vice versa and discussed the challenges of desertification and land desertification in the EU – both issues were addressed in special reports we published in 2018.
Janusz Wojciechowski, member of the Court, at the presentation of our special report on air quality in December 2018 in Katowice School Project Day Throughout the year, the Court staff participated in the school project day organised by the EU institutions.
17 of our staff attended their secondary schools in seven Member States and informed the pupils about the EU, the role of our institution and the possibilities to study in the EU and work with the EU institutions. 40
Relations with institutional addressees The impact of our work depends on the benefits our institutional addressees derive from it We work closely with the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and national parliaments, as the impact of our work depends to a large extent on the benefits these institutions derive from our audit results and recommendations.
European Parliament The number of reports discussed in parliamentary committees is a record The members of the Court and the audit teams are regularly invited to present their findings and recommendations to the Committee on Budgetary Control and other committees of the European Parliament and other bodies.
In the course of 2018, we presented to Parliament 33 special reports, four opinions and six analysis-based publications.
In total, we attended 74 meetings with the Committee on Budgetary Control (2017: 60) and 38 meetings with 13 other committees and working groups of Parliament and with political groups in Parliament.
The joint annual meeting of the Court's representatives with the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control took place in February 2018.
In April 2018, President Lehne took part in the debate in the plenary session of the European Parliament on the discharge procedure for 2016.
In October 2018, he presented the Court's annual report for the financial year 2017 to the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and to the plenary. 41
In addition, 44 presentations were held for other relevant Council preparatory bodies (2017: 27).
During the year, we presented 37 special reports, four opinions and three analysis-based publications to the Council (2017: 27).
In January 2018, during the Bulgarian Presidency, President Lehne met with the Deputy Minister of Finance of Bulgaria to discuss key audit findings on the 2016 discharge procedure.
In March 2018, President Lehne and Neven Mates, the Court's Special Report on Macroeconomic Imbalance, presented the report to EU finance ministers during the ECOFIN meeting.
Thus, for the first time, a special report was presented to the EU finance ministers of the ECOFIN Council.
President Lehne also presented our annual report 2017 at the ECOFIN meeting in November, during the Austrian Presidency.
Prior to the meeting, President Lehne met the Austrian Federal Minister for Finance, in his capacity as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, and the Minister for Public Finance of Romania – this Member State held the Presidency at the beginning of 2019 – to discuss with them our annual report 2017 and the corresponding discharge procedure and to inform them of other relevant activities of the Court.
First presentation of a special report before ECOFIN 42
Member State governments and parliaments Meeting of the President of the Court with senior government representatives in five Member States During the year, President Lehne visited many EU Member States – Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Romania – and met with high-level government representatives.
These visits were often combined with participation in an official State event or a high-level conference.
In addition, the members of the Court presented the 2017 Annual Report to the national parliaments and/or other national authorities of 14 Member States.
We also took the opportunity to present some of our special reports to the relevant parliamentary committees of national parliaments.
Delegations from national parliaments occasionally visit the Court and we continue to explore ways to further deepen our cooperation with national parliaments.

Cooperation with EU Member States' Supreme Audit Institutions (ORKBs) In active cooperation with the EU's SAIs: a joint call to address weaknesses in the accountability and audit rules for EU banking supervision Our cooperation with the EU's Supreme Audit Institutions is primarily carried out within the framework of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of EU-ORKBs.
In October 2018, we actively participated in the annual meeting of the Contact Committee, which was hosted by the SAIs of Croatia under their own chairmanship.
The discussions focused on interaction with EU citizens and on making the SAIs accessible to the public.
Court President Klaus-Heiner Lehne speaks to the President of the EU-ORKB at the annual meeting of the Contact Committee in Dubrovnik, Croatia, October 2018 Together with the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the 28 Member States, we appealed to national governments and parliaments, as well as to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to address a number of weaknesses in the accountability and audit arrangements for EU banking supervision.
In addition, the Court took part and participated in the activities of several working bodies of the Contact Committee, including the Working Group on Value Added Tax, the Financial Policy Audit Network, the Europe 2020 Review Network and the European Banking Union Task Force, and other activities in the areas of financial reporting in the public sector and public procurement audit.
The Court also coordinated the preparation of the first examination compendium of the Contact Committee (Youth unemployment and the vocational integration of young people), based on audit reports drawn up by 14 EU-ORCs between 2013 and 2017.
With the publication of the examination compendium, the Contact Committee presents a new product 44
INTOSAI/EUROSAI In 2018, we continued our active participation and participation in the activities of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), in particular in our function as Deputy Chair of the Committee on Technical Standards (since December 2016) and as a member of the Subcommittee for Auditing Accounting and Accounting, the Subcommittee for Auditing Compliance with Legal Standards and the Subcommittee for Economic Audits.
We also actively participated in the activities of other INTOSAI working bodies, including the peer reviews subcommittee, the environmental audit working group, the working group on financial modernisation and regulatory reform, and the task force for the professionalisation of auditors.

Performance Measurement Our new key performance indicators in the 2018-2020 strategy Since 2008, we have been using Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to inform management of the progress made towards our goals, support the decision-making process, and provide information to our users about our performance.
We not only set our strategy for 2018-2020, but also adjusted our KPIs for this period.
Thus, 2018 is the first year in which we can report on these indicators.
These five KPIs provide a comprehensive overview of how we manage our work in terms of dissemination, impact and perception. o KPI 1 – Implementation of our recommendations o KPI 2 – Stakeholders' feedback on our work o KPI 3 – Our views in the European Parliament, Council and national parliaments o KPI 4 – Number of special reports (and similar products) published (number of special reports [and similar products]) o KPI 5 – Our presence in the media (court's media presence) 50
51 Number of Special Reports and Similar Products in 2018 We monitor the number and timing of reports published throughout the year.
This provides an indication of the accuracy of our planning.
Of the 47 reports planned for 2018, 44 were published: 35 special reports, six thematic papers, two landscape analyses and a quick analysis.
In addition to the selected audits provided for in our work programme, we delivered ten opinions.
Special reports and similar products 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 44 30 2017 2018 Our appearances in the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and in national parliaments Most of our audit reports are presented to the competent committee of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
In addition, most of the Court's members present our annual reports to the national parliament of their respective Member States.
In 2018, representatives of the Court spoke to the European Parliament 133 times (2017: 91), 65 times in the Council (2017: 47) and 50 times in front of national parliaments (2017: 19).
This represents a significant increase compared to 2017.

We have published o 76 press releases in 23 EU languages (2017: 57) and o 20 press briefings in Brussels (2017: 16), including press briefings for the annual report, including briefings regarding both the sector and the Member States concerned.
We also received journalists from Brussels and the Member States and offered industry stakeholders, NGOs and think tanks several briefings on selected reports.
53 Visits to Luxembourg by Member State journalists in November 2018 We monitor media coverage of our work and our institution, which can vary considerably depending on the topic and complexity of a report.
At the same time, we must take into account that external factors can strongly influence the media's interest in our publications.
For example, if the date of publication coincides with an important event or political development, public interest in the subject may increase significantly.
The total number of media reports, including social media, has almost tripled: while there were around 15,500 online articles and social media contributions in 2017, their number has increased to more than 44,000 in 2018.
Social media posts posted by the Court's official accounts regarding our publications were displayed around 11 million times in 2018, almost 18 times more frequently than in 2017.
Special reports are clearly our flagship product in terms of media coverage As regards communication and media coverage, the special reports have clearly become our flagship product. Twelve of the Court's 15 most successful publications in 2018 were special reports.
In that year, there were more than 11,000 online articles on our special reports, which means that the number has increased by more than double the number compared to 2017.
On the other hand, the total number of online articles in 2013 was 1,500 – the year we started tracking media coverage.
Compared to 2017, there was also an increase of 60% of the average number of media reports per special report.
This means that our presence in the media has increased not only because of a higher number of reports, but also because of a greater interest in our publications.

The court has five social media accounts: * This number indicates how many times our posts have been displayed.
Throughout the year, we have seen an exponential increase in our presence and involvement in social media, especially on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, which are now an essential part of our communication activities and enable us to engage in direct exchanges with citizens.
The number of our followers and subscribers and the number of our impressions, which shows how often our posted posts were displayed, have increased.

Impact and perception of our work Our reports – useful and effective We assess the impact and perception of our work on the basis of assessments by the recipients.Another evaluation criterion is the follow-up to our recommendations to improve EU financial management.
At the beginning of 2018, we started to ask our stakeholders (from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, from EU agencies, permanent representations of Member States, Member States' public bodies, national SAIs, NGOs, science, the media, etc.) to provide feedback on the usefulness and likely impact of our reports.
These feedbacks concern selected special reports and analyses, as well as the Court's annual reports, and are obtained by anonymous electronic surveys from all those who have previously received a copy of these reports.
This survey also allows stakeholders to provide qualitative feedback on reports and make general proposals on the Court's work.
Overall, 87% of respondents confirmed the usefulness of our reports for their work and 78% agreed with them.

Follow-up to our recommendations Most of our recommendations have been implemented Since 2018, we have been using a follow-up carried out by our auditors as a basis for this indicator instead of the European Commission's management statement.
For 2018, we analysed the recommendations made in our 2014 special reports and the annual report of the same year.
This analysis shows that 74% of the recommendations we made in our 2014 Annual Report and 94% of the recommendations in our 2014 Special Reports have been fully, largely or partially implemented.

Our staff staff at the end of 2018 employed 834 temporary officials and staff at the European Court of Auditors.
The Court's establishment plan included 853 permanent and scheduled posts – including 541 in the examination chambers – including 112 posts in the members' cabinets.
Areas of activity of our staff: Examination services, translation, administration and services of the President 58 Examination services 541 Translation Administration Presidential services 135 A total of 853 129 48 In addition, 76 contract staff and 15 seconded national experts were employed at the Court at the end of the year.
Recruitment The staff of the Court have a broad academic and professional background.
With our recruitment policy, we follow the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and promote equal opportunities at all levels.
In 2018, the Court hired 79 staff: 15 officials, 32 temporary staff, 22 contract staff and ten seconded national experts.
We also provided 60 university graduates with internships for periods of three to five months.
Age profile The age profile of active staff on 31 December 2018 indicates that almost half of our employees are 44 years old or younger.
30 of the 64 directors and executive managers of the Court (47%) are 55 years of age or older.
Age profile 59 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65+ 0% -1% 2% 4% -1% 5% 10% 15% 25% 7% 12% 16% 18% 20% 23% 18% Note: differences in aggregates are due to rounding.
Overall, we have achieved a balanced proportion of women and men among our employees; 45% of our auditors and board members are women.

Our equal opportunities policy for the period 2018-2020 also addresses issues related to age and disability.

Supporting audit activities Professional further training Continuing training: how we prepare our employees and the Court for the future In line with the recommendations published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), we strive to provide each auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training per year.
In 2018, we were once again above this target with 6.9 training days per examiner.
We have also extended the range of training courses that we offer to employees both inside and outside the audit area, and have supported examiners in obtaining various certifications.
We continued our successful series of presentations, which were held by internal or external experts on developments in the field of testing or other topics relating to the work of our auditors.
We continued our "Performance Recognition Awards" program, which allows non-management employees to participate in specific external training.
Average number of training days per year 7.0 6.7 6.9 Objective ≥ 2 days 2016 2017 Per examiner 2018 4.0 2016 2.3 3.1 2017 2018 Objective ≥ 5 days Per non examiner 62 days
Successful cooperation with educational institutions We have signed a partnership agreement with the College of Europe (Brügge, Belgium), which provides for cooperation in several areas, including training, traineeships and reports.
We have also concluded cooperation agreements with the European Institute for Public Administration and other organisations to enable our staff to attend training courses organised by these institutions.
We have continued and expanded our cooperation with the University of Lorraine: Once again we offered the postgraduate degree program "Audit of public organisations and policies" and the Master's degree program "Management of public organisations". In addition, we have designed a new postgraduate program called "Fundamentals of statistics applied to audit".
Finally, auditors from other SAIs took part in our internal training sessions. Some of them shared their experience in the field of illustrating reports on the annual Court Training Day, attended by more than 450 people.
Interactive public online courses We made our online business assessment training available to the public and held two interactive seminars with a capacity of more than 150 participants from all over the world.
Translation The Court's Translation, Language Services and Publication Directorate translated and revised more than 251 000 pages in 2018, an increase of more than 18% compared to 2017.
This increase also led to a higher outsourcing rate.
In addition, all our translation teams are now using harmonised working methods.
The translators have been increasingly involved in the Court's audit activities by providing linguistic support during audit visits and in the preparation of most reports.
As a result, we managed to create further synergies with our auditors.
The publication team is now a full part of the Directorate.
Review of originals for translation and finally for publication, integrated into a single, optimized workflow.
Information, Work Environment and Innovation Our Information, Work Environment and Innovation Directorate supports our employees in the effective and efficient use of information technologies by promoting innovation and knowledge management.
Information Management We have launched a new initiative called tECAway, which gives our employees access to the network on the go.
This will allow them to access the Court's digital resources and services on all devices, anywhere and at any time.
The Court has created a new harmonised document management system and has introduced multi-function devices for printing, copying and scanning.
We expect these devices to have a beneficial impact on information security and paper consumption.
We have also introduced a new governance model for cybersecurity and are currently working on implementing the cybersecurity plan.
All IT projects and IT solutions have taken due account of the maintenance of business operations, ensuring the full availability of critical systems.
Innovation We have also set up the ECAB, an interdisciplinary innovation laboratory whose focus is on the digitisation of the examination area through the use of data and technology.
ECAB tests the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing and text mining in real test tasks.
This support has already benefited from several tasks and publications.
We have also carried out a pilot project on the use of blockchain technologies for notarial certification of audit evidence and publications.
The resulting prototype, the ECA registry, was selected by the European Blockchain Partnership – set up by EU Member States and the Commission – as part of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, which will be developed from 2019.
Knowledge Management In July 2018, our first annual summer course in the field of public financial control took place, which we organized together with the University of Pisa and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).
45 people from SAIs, EU institutions and universities took part in the summer course, whose focus was on data analysis for exams.
We also held a conference on blockchain, where we explored the possibilities offered by this technology and its practical applications for controlling EU expenditure.
This conference was primarily aimed at participants from other EU institutions.
Building The courtyard currently has three buildings ("K1, "K2" and "K3"), which form a single integrated technical unit.
The Court also offers office space for its Centre for the Recovery of Data in Luxembourg.
The remaining floors are used for offices for up to 241 employees, with meeting rooms, a conference room with interpreting booths, video conference rooms, a cafeteria and a basic kitchen area.
A detailed study on this project will be carried out in 2019 and work is expected to begin at the end of this year.
As approved by the European Parliament and Council in March 2014, the Court will use the remaining resources of the K3 construction project completed a few years ago to finance this modernisation.
K3 The K3 building was opened in 2012.
Based on the world's leading method for assessing and certifying the sustainability of buildings (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, BREEAM), the K3 building was rated "very good".
A new security control centre and an external accreditation and access control centre for employees and visitors was put into operation in September 2018.
The main EurH building "K1" and the new safety control centre in Rue Alcide De Gasperi, Luxembourg Environmental management As an institution of the European Union, it is our duty to follow the principle of sound environmental management in all activities.
We are therefore endeavouring to reduce the environmental impact of the farm steadily.
We now successfully operate an EMAS-compliant environmental management system and fully meet the certification requirements of ISO 14001:2015.
As part of our goal of systematically reducing our CO2 emissions, we regularly examine the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our activities.
Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 amounted to a total of 10 451 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), which represents a 3% reduction compared to 2016.
2018 was the fourth consecutive year for which the Court examined its carbon footprint.
67 Court's accountability Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union, with its budget falling within the area of administrative expenditure.
In 2018, the Court's budget amounted to around 146 million euros.
This represents less than 0.1% of total EU expenditure and around 1.5% of total EU administrative expenditure.
The share of the 2018 budget appropriations used was 96%.

Internal and external audit Internal audit The Internal Audit Service advises the Court on risk management issues.
It provides independent and objective guarantees and provides advisory services designed to add value and improve the Court's activities.
It shall also report to the Internal Audit Committee, composed of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee shall regularly monitor progress on the various tasks set out in the annual work programme of the Internal Audit Service and ensure the independence of the Office.
In 2018, she conducted an audit of the Court's cybersecurity systems and construction work on its perimeter protection.
The department also examined the implementation of the Court's risk management policy and the statements made annually by the authorising officers by delegation.
It also monitored the implementation of its previous recommendations to ensure that the agreed action plans had taken shape.
In 2018, the audit carried out by the department did not reveal any deficiencies which, due to their nature or extent, would seriously jeopardise the reliability of the internal control systems as a whole; those control systems had been introduced by the authorising officer by delegation in order to ensure the legality and regularity of the Court's financial operations.
We report annually to the European Parliament and to the Council on the results of the internal audit work.
External control Our annual accounts are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying to itself the same principles of transparency and accountability as those that it has examined.
The auditor's report — PricewaterhouseCoopers Sàrl. — on the Court's annual accounts for the financial year 2017 was published on 17 May 2018. 70
Audit opinions of the independent auditor – Financial year 2017 71 On the Court's annual accounts: "According to our assessment, the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the European Court of Auditors' financial and financial position (hereinafter referred to as "the Court") as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in net assets for the year ending on that date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 347, 31.12.2012, p.
1) and its subsequent amendments, hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Regulation", and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Financial Regulation and its subsequent amendments.';
As regards the use of resources and the Court's control procedures: "In our work described in this report, we have not encountered situations from which we would have to conclude that, in all essential respects and taking into account the above assessment criteria, the funds allocated to the Court have not been used for the intended purposes and that the control procedures established do not provide the necessary assurance that the financial operations have been carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations."
Discharge Like the other EU institutions, the Court is also subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2018, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2016.
As in every year, we have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our audit and management responsibility, we have taken appropriate measures and we have reported in detail to the European Parliament on our follow-up.
On 26 March 2019, the European Parliament granted discharge to our Secretary-General for the financial year 2017.
This means that our financial statements for 2017 were finally approved.
Peer Reviews Peer Reviews mean independent and transparent expert reviews of the capabilities of a particular SAI carried out by other SAI.
Each SAI participating in the peer review shall continue to respect the independence of the other SAI during its implementation.
We asked the SAIs of Estonia (Leading SAIs), Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States of America in 2018 to assess whether the Court is on its way to achieving its strategic objectives at the mid-term of the 2018-2020 period and whether it is likely that the measures we have implemented so far will have the desired impact.
The peer review report is expected to be published in early 2019.
At the same time, we began to prepare the peer review of the SAIs of Lithuania together with the SAIs of Poland and the United Kingdom.
The main objective of this expert assessment will be to assess whether the SAIs' audit approach complies with international standards.
We also commissioned an external and independent evaluation of the Court's ethical framework during the year.
This peer review is carried out by the Courts of Auditors of Croatia and Poland.
The audit report is expected to be available in 2019. 72

European Court of Auditors 5 Who we are o external auditors of the European Union; o established 1975 by the Treaty of Brussels; taking up office in October 1977; since the Maastricht Treaty of 1993 full-fledged EU institution; o head office in Luxembourg; o one member per EU Member State appointed by the Council after consulting the European Parliament; o about 900 employees of all EU nationalities.
Our role o We ensure that the EU ensures proper financial management, that its financial rules are correctly applied and that its policies and programmes achieve its objectives and that the best use of funds is made. o We contribute to improving the financial management of the EU and to promoting accountability and transparency. o We warn against risks, provide audit certainty, point to weaknesses and successes and provide guidance to policy-makers and legislators of the Union. o We make our comments and recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council, national governments and parliaments and the general public. Foreword of the President Dear reader, dear reader!
The year 2019 was marked by many changes for the Union: elections to the European Parliament took place and a new European Commission took office.
The strategic priorities have been redefined and important packages of measures launched, such as the "European Green Deal" or the "Digital Future of Europe" (beginning of 2020).
Towards the end of the year it became clear that we would now be a Union of 27 Member States.
At the same time, the EU is at a significant crossroads in terms of its finances.
We are about to conclude negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the outcome of which will be decisive for the Union's financing capacity over the next seven years.
All EU institutions must now build on the efforts made so far to further improve the Union's financial management and ensure that the EU delivers results.
As an external auditor, we offer an impartial assessment of the Union's policies and programmes and the quality of EU financial management within and outside the Union.
We are examining whether EU expenditure is in line with the rules and whether Union policies and programmes ensure optimal use of funds.
This activity report gives an overview of our work in 2019, in which we published a large number of up-to-date special reports, analyses and opinions.
You will also find information about our employees, our management and our finances.
We hope that this information will be useful to you.
We are publishing our Annual Activity Report this year at a time when public health in the EU and its Member States is facing an unprecedented challenge as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our institution reacted rapidly to this situation in accordance with the Luxembourg Government's health and safety instructions.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their good work and for their willingness to adapt flexibly to the current situation.
We must now stand together and do everything we can to continue to fulfil our role as external auditors of the EU in these difficult times.

8 Our Activities Strategy In order to continue to shape developments in the field of public financial control, we rely on multiannual strategies to make long-term choices for our audit work and to push forward initiatives for organizational change with a view to continuous improvements.
At the end of 2019, we had completed the second year of our current strategy for 2018-2020.
During this three-year period, we set ourselves the following strategic goals: improving the added value of the Statement of Assurance; focusing more on the performance aspects of EU measures; communicating clear statements to our audience.
In order to implement our strategy in practice, we have agreed on an action plan covering these objectives.
Over the last two years, we have made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives.
A number of initiatives and projects have been launched in all areas envisaged, which sometimes go beyond the objectives of the Action Plan, in particular: o a pilot phase of the test-oriented audit approach for the preparation of the Statement of Assurance, which has led to useful findings; o a significant increase in the number of economic audits and analytical products, as well as a wider range of topics, covering both EU expenditure and regulatory action; o better contact with the European Parliament and greater visibility in traditional and social media.
During the year, a group of four Supreme Audit Institutions (Estonia, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United States) conducted a peer review of our strategy.
Our peers' report was published in March 2020, just in time to provide valuable impetus for our next strategy from 2021 onwards.
Good progress in implementing our strategy 9
Auditing the efficiency and regularity of EU policies Auditing the financial statements, audits and compliance audits Our audit reviews look at the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of EU policies and programmes.
The focus is on issues that reflect EU-relevant issues such as the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources, growth and inclusion, challenges associated with migration and global development, the internal market and banking union, as well as ensuring the accountability and economic viability of the European Union.
These audits should help the EU to better achieve its policy objectives.
Our audits of the accounts and our compliance audits lead to our statement of reliability of the accounts as well as the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
We may also carry out selected compliance audits to examine the budgetary and financial management of the Union or to assess whether the management and control systems established to collect and use EU funds comply with the applicable EU and national rules.
Our audits are in line with internationally accepted auditing principles for the public sector. 10
Work Programme Strategic Perspectives In 2019, we continued to embed the strategic perspective in our audit work in order to better address the key future challenges for the EU through a forward-looking approach.
To this end, we have set up an Advisory Committee on Strategy and Perspectives.
One of the current tasks of this Committee, composed of five members, is to monitor the development of the post-2020 strategy.
Audit priorities with a view to the topics relevant to the future of the EU Our work programme was published in October 2019, in which we present our audit priorities for the coming years and the 41 reports and analyses, the publication of which is planned for 2020, in detail.
With our audits planned for 2020 and beyond, we will continue to provide the citizens of the Union and policy makers with independent reports on issues relevant to the future of the EU.
We are preparing the work programme for our audits in an independent way, but not in complete isolation from our environment.
It is therefore of the utmost importance for us to work with our institutional stakeholders, in particular the European Parliament.
As usual, at the beginning of 2019, we asked all parliamentary committees to propose possible audit topics for our work programme. 11
On-site examination The majority of our examination work takes place in our premises in Luxembourg.
Our auditors also carry out numerous audit visits to the European Commission – our main audited body – as well as to the other EU institutions, as well as EU agencies and bodies, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States, EU delegations in third countries and international organisations to which EU funds are allocated.
We also carry out on-the-spot audits of beneficiaries of EU funds within and outside the EU.
These audits will enable us to understand the audit trail and obtain direct audit evidence from, and from, the beneficiaries of, the bodies involved in the management of Union policies and programmes and the collection or disbursement of EU funds.
In line with the objective set out in the EU Financial Regulation, we strive to complete our selected audits within 13 months. 12
3 605 days of on-site audit work – inside and outside the EU Our audit teams usually consist of two to three examiners, and the duration of an audit visit may be a few days, but also several weeks.
Within the EU, our on-the-spot audits are generally coordinated with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States concerned.
13 The frequency and intensity of our audit work in each Member State and recipient country depend on the type of audit we carry out.
In 2019, our auditors spent 3 605 days (2018: 3 671 days) with on-site inspections – in the Member States and outside the EU.
In addition, our auditors spent 2,504 days (2018: 2,723 days) with the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as with decentralised agencies and bodies throughout the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations or the OECD, as well as with audit firms.
To interact with our audited bodies, we are increasingly making use of video conferencing and other information technologies, such as secure exchange of data and documents. 14
Audit reports, analyses and opinions Our audit reports, analyses and opinions form an important link in the EU's accountability chain.
They help the European Parliament and the Council to monitor and verify whether the EU achieves its policy objectives and to hold the bodies responsible for the budget management of the EU accountable, in particular within the framework of the annual discharge procedure.
Special reports and analytical products In line with our strategy for 2018-2020, we have increasingly focused on assessing the performance of EU action in recent years.
In 2019, we published 36 special reports and analyses addressing many of the challenges facing the Union in the various EU spending areas, such as food safety, renewable energy, e-commerce, border controls, budgetary governance and ethical frameworks in selected EU institutions, to name just a few. 15
16 In our special reports, we examine whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved in an effective and economic way, and whether the EU measures have created added value – i.e. whether they have achieved more than can be achieved by action at national level alone.
We also make recommendations on financial savings, better working methods, avoiding waste or more effective achievement of the policy objectives.
Our analyses are intended to provide introductory descriptions and analytical considerations, often from a cross-sectional perspective and on the basis of previous tests or other publicly available information.
They can also be used to present our analysis of areas or issues that have not yet been examined, or to compile facts on specific topics or problems.
In contrast to tests, they neither respond to evaluation questions nor provide a guarantee of reliability.
17 Sustainable use of natural resources Analysis No. 01/2019: The EU's response to the "diesel scandal" In 2015, deviations between the emission levels achieved on the test bench and the road were detected in diesel engines.
Studies have shown that so-called "decommissioning devices" were used, which caused lower emissions in official tests than in normal driving operations.
The type-approval authorities of some Member States reacted to the emissions scandal by re-testing diesel cars.
These tests showed that exhaust emissions from road transport in almost all light diesel commercial vehicles in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes significantly exceeded the permitted NOx limits, in some cases by more than 10 times.
We considered the measures taken by both the EU and the Member States in response to the "diesel scandal".
We also included in our consideration the changes made to the exhaust emission measurement system after September 2015.
We noted that many legal changes to the EU type-approval and emission testing system have been adopted with speed.
The Commission is now empowered to review the work of the national type-approval authorities, and may also have vehicles tested and type-approval revoked or suspended.
The third parties concerned can now also carry out emission tests.
The Commission also initiated infringement proceedings against certain Member States.
We also noted that in several Member States there has been an increase in the willingness to restrict motor vehicle traffic in order to improve air quality, and in several European cities low-emission zones where car traffic is restricted or prohibited.
We presented our work results in the form of an analysis, as the changes made to legislation will not have a measurable impact in the near future.
Our analyses do not contain recommendations.
18 Investments for Cohesion, Growth and Integration Special Report No 08/2019: Wind and solar energy for electricity generation: to achieve the EU's objectives, substantial efforts are needed Electricity can be generated either from non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, non-recoverable waste and nuclear fuels in conventional reactors, or from renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind and solar energy, biomass, etc.
Renewable energies also serve the production of heat and cooling as well as the extraction of fuels for the transport sector.
Currently, 79% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions are due to the use of fossil fuels for energy production.
A higher share of renewable energy in electricity generation will contribute to achieving the EU's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Member States shall determine how best to use their energy resources and how to structure their energy supply.
The EU can support Member States' actions by providing additional funding for investments in renewable energy projects.
We assessed the progress made by the EU and the Member States towards the targets set for the share of renewable energy in order to achieve the overall EU target of 20% by 2020 and 32% by 2030.
In Germany, Greece, Spain and Poland, we checked locally whether the promotion of electricity generation from wind energy and photovoltaics was effective.
We noted that significant progress had been made as regards the share of renewable energy in the energy mix from 2005 onwards, but this trend slowed down after 2014.
The share of renewable energy in electricity generation in the EU has risen from around 15% (in 2015) to just under 31% (in 2017) and has thus doubled.
Wind and solar energy were the technologies that made the greatest contribution to this increase.
However, achieving the targets for around half of the Member States will be a major challenge.
We recommended that the Commission encourage Member States to support further development – through the implementation of auctions for additional capacity in the field of renewable energy, the promotion of greater citizen participation, the simplification of administrative procedures and the elimination of network inadequacies.
We also recommended that the Commission review the legal requirements of the Member States in order to improve the timeliness of the statistical data.
19 External policies, security and justice Special Report No 24/2019: Asylum, resettlement and return of migrants: Time to step up measures to eliminate disparities between objectives and results In 2015, the European Union experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, followed by an increase in asylum applications.
In recent years, immigration figures have fallen back to pre-crisis levels.
We conducted interviews with staff at the European Commission, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (commonly referred to as "Frontex").
Verification visits to national authorities, international organisations and non-governmental organisations carrying out EU-funded projects have also been carried out, and 20 EU support actions have been carried out in Greece and Italy.
Both Member States are particularly affected by these migratory flows.
We assessed whether the objectives of EU-funded support were met and asylum and return procedures were implemented effectively and expeditiously.
We also examined whether the targets and targets of the temporary emergency relocation arrangements have been achieved.
We found that quotas had improved significantly when registering and fingerprinting in the hotspots.
Nevertheless, a large number of migrants continue to move to other EU Member States and apply for asylum without their fingerprints being stored in the Eurodac database.
In both Member States, the implementation of asylum procedures remains characterised by long processing times and bottlenecks.
A large proportion of applicants were actually relocated (80% in Greece and 89% in Italy).
Nevertheless, the relocation process in the countries receiving migrants has not been monitored by the Commission since February 2018.
As in the other EU countries, the return rates from Greece and Italy are low.
We recommended that the next Commission should take appropriate measures to improve the management of emergency aid.
In addition, the Commission should make use of past experience in the development of future voluntary relocation mechanisms.
Finally, EASO support for asylum procedures should be improved and Frontex support for return operations adjusted.
20 Market regulation and competitive economy Special Report No 10/2019: EU-wide stress tests for banks: more information about banks than ever before, but stronger coordination and risk focus needed The EU-wide stress test aims to assess the potential impact that a common shock could have on the financial situation and the viability of large European banks.
It is the task of the European Banking Authority (EBA), in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to initiate and coordinate the implementation of Union-wide banking stress tests.
Stress tests have been carried out in the EU since 2011, with the bottom-up approach being applied to all banks providing the results of the shock scenario based on the methodology approved by EBA.
We evaluated the implementation of the EU-wide banking stress test under the mandate given to EBA.
We found that at the beginning of the procedure, the EBA did not specify the risks or the severity it considered relevant for the stress test procedure.
The ESRB, which developed the stress scenario, again received a substantial input from the ECB as well as from national central banks and authorities.
As a result, EBA lacked control over key phases of the procedure.
In the United States, regulators rely on a top-down approach, giving them much greater control over the results achieved by banks.
Conversely, the role of EBA in the EU is limited to the introduction of stress tests, the provision of methodology and the extensive coordination of stress tests.
The EBA stress test assessed the vulnerability of the system and banks to economic downturn rather than a severe financial shock affecting the system.
Although EBA was pursuing a broad coverage objective, certain risky banks were excluded from the stress test.
The bottom-up approach of EBA led to a limited reliability and comparability of the results achieved by banks.
We recommended that EBA should strengthen its control over the stress testing process and develop a top-down approach to complement the current bottom-up approach.
In order to fulfil their purpose of assessing resilience to adverse market developments, future stress tests should also take due account of the risks arising within the EU financial system, ensure a minimum level of stress and provide clear statements on the resilience of banks.
Finally, the choice of banks for the stress test should be based not only on size but also on risk.
21 Financing and administration of the Union Special Report No 14/2019: "Your opinion counts!"
While the Commission's public consultations involve citizens, there is a lack of public relations "better regulation" is about ensuring that political decisions are prepared openly and transparently, based on the best facts available and supported by citizens and other stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and representative associations that are fully involved.
The Commission is obliged to consult citizens and representative associations in all areas of Union action.
The Better Regulation Guidelines define stakeholder consultation, and at the same time make citizens "interest-makers".
Consultations with stakeholders, in particular during public consultations, shall seek information and opinions from citizens and other stakeholders when the Commission prepares a policy initiative or evaluates ongoing interventions.
On average, the Commission carries out more than 100 public consultations per year.
We assessed whether the Commission's public consultations have effectively contributed to reaching out to citizens and stakeholders and making use of their contributions.
We studied the design of the Commission framework, the way in which the Commission has prepared and carried out a selection of public consultations and how it has provided information on the consultation activities and used the consultation work.
We reviewed a sample of 26 Commission public consultations carried out by five Directorates-General from 2016 to 2018 and conducted an opinion poll to determine how satisfied the participants in public consultations were.
We noted that the Commission's framework for public consultation has a high standard.
In addition, the Commission's overall sample of public consultations showed a positive picture and its perception by the participants was generally satisfactory.
Inefficiencies have been identified in public relations and feedback, such as not always using the full range of communication channels, lack of clear criteria to justify why a questionnaire was not available in all EU official languages, and some questionnaires were long and complex.
We recommended that public advertising for the consultations should be made on a larger scale and more targeted in order to improve visibility and allow more people to participate.
We also encouraged the Commission to report better on the follow-up to the public consultation.
Finally, there is potential for improvement in the participation of citizens when it comes to launching legislative proposals within the framework of the European Citizens' Initiative.
Audit previews Audit previews provide information on ongoing audit tasks (in the field of audit).
They are based on the preparatory work carried out prior to the start of an audit and are intended to serve as a source of information for all those interested in certain policies and/or programmes subject to an ongoing audit.
In 2019 we published 18 previews (2018: 12).
Annual reports and special annual reports The annual reports mainly contain the results of our Statement of Assurance on the European Union budget and on the European Development Funds (EDF).
The special annual reports contain the results of our annual audit of the accounts of the agencies, decentralised bodies and Joint Undertakings of the EU and the European Schools.
We also publish a report on contingent liabilities resulting from the Single Resolution Committee (SRB) carrying out its tasks. 22
Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2018 Every year, we review the revenue and expenditure of the EU to assess whether the annual accounts are reliable and the underlying revenue and expenditure operations are in line with the relevant EU and Member State legislation.
We also provide specific assessments of all key areas of the EU budget, based on the (partial) headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020.
Furthermore, we analyse why and where errors have occurred, make recommendations for improvements and examine whether and to what extent our previous recommendations have been put into practice.
Finally, we provide information on budgetary and financial management as well as performance-related information.
This extensive work forms the basis of our Statement of Assurance, which we must submit to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with our mandate set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
EU general budget: full audit opinion on the reliability of accounts and revenue; limited audit opinion on expenditure In 2018, EU expenditure amounted to EUR 156.7 billion, representing 2.2% of the total expenditure of the general government of the EU Member States and 1% of the gross national income of the Union.
Our auditors examined a sample of 728 payments made to beneficiaries in all areas of expenditure of the EU budget from a population of around 120 billion euros to be examined.
This means that we have reviewed various cases where EU funds have been used to support key infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in the EU Member States or to support beneficiaries in non-EU countries.
For the 2018 financial year, we gave a full audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the revenue of the EU.
In addition, for the third year in a row, we were able to present a limited audit opinion on EU expenditure. 23
Around half of the expenditure audited has no significant error rate As in previous years, we found that the errors in EU expenditure were not comprehensive and that payments were lawful and proper, except for high-risk expenditure (mainly complex expenditure on a cost-refund basis).
24 In total, the Commission and the Member States were able to maintain the progress recorded in the two previous years with an error rate of 2.6% (financial year 2017: 2.4%; financial year 2016: 3.1%).
We see this as an encouraging sign.
Mistakes – what does that mean?
An error or irregular payment is the amount of the funds that should not have been paid from the EU budget because they were not used in accordance with EU or national rules and therefore do not comply with the objectives pursued by the Council and Parliament with the relevant EU legislation or run counter to specific national rules in the Member States.
We estimate the error rate using statistical methods, based on quantifiable (i.e. monetaryly measurable) errors that we have identified by examining a sample of operations within the whole audited population of expenditure.
The most error-prone MFF heading: Economic, social and territorial cohesion In the 2018 financial year, the "Economic, social and territorial cohesion" area was the most error-prone MFF (partial) heading, followed by "Natural resources" and "Competitiveness for growth and employment". 25
Annual report on the European Development Funds EDF: full audit opinion on the reliability of accounts and revenue; limited audit opinion on expenditure 26 The European Development Funds (EDF) are the EU's main instruments of assistance in the context of development cooperation.
The EDFs aim to overcome poverty and promote sustainable development and the integration of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and overseas countries and territories into the world economy.
The EDFs are financed by the Member States of the Union and managed outside the EU budget by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
As in previous years, we gave a full audit opinion on the reliability of EDF accounts and revenue and a limited audit opinion on EDF expenditure for the financial year 2018.
Special annual reports on EU agencies and Joint Undertakings The EU agencies are separate entities with their own legal personality established to carry out specific technical and scientific tasks and administrative tasks, thus helping to shape and implement the policies of the EU institutions.
There are 43 agencies in total.
Joint Undertakings are EU public-private partnerships with industry, research groups and Member States, which play an important role in implementing certain aspects of EU research policy.
The European Commission is the member of the Joint Undertaking and represents the EU.
A total of eight Joint Undertakings exist.
27 Note: The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020.
Full audit opinion for all agencies except one; full audit opinion for all Joint Undertakings Total appropriations for all agencies (excluding the SRB) in the financial year 2018 amounted to 4.2 billion euros, i.e. 20% more than in 2017 (3.5 billion), representing approximately 2.9% of the EU general budget for 2018 (2017: 2.7%).
Overall, our audit of the accounts of the agencies for the financial year 2018 confirmed the positive results shown in previous years.
We gave full audit opinions on the reliability of the accounts, revenue and underlying payments to the agencies' annual accounts, with the exception of EASO, which has been given a limited audit opinion on payments.
We also gave all the Joint Undertakings full audit opinions on the reliability of the accounts, revenue and expenditure.
Parliament's discharge procedure kicks off The publication of our annual reports is at the beginning of the discharge procedure, during which the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Council, decides whether the Commission and other bodies have managed the EU budget satisfactorily.
In October 2019, we presented our annual reports on the EU general budget and the EDF to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and subsequently also to the plenary of the European Parliament, the Council ("Economy and Finance") and the parliaments and national authorities of 21 Member States.
28 Other annual reports: contingency liabilities and European schools We are obliged to report annually on all contingent liabilities incurred by the Single Resolution Committee, the Council and the Commission in connection with the performance of their tasks in the field of bank resolution.
In our 2018 report, we concluded that the Committee has improved the presentation of its accounts, but needs better reporting on contingent liabilities at national level.
We also publish an annual report on the annual accounts of the European Schools.
Our audit of the annual accounts for 2018 revealed a significant error rate for one of the 13 European schools.
On the way to a digital audit Digitalisation is about exploiting the potential of technologies to provide more and better information for the accountability process.
Digital change is also of great importance for our audit work and our organisation.
We have set up a five-member Digitalisation Steering Committee to steer this transformation process in the coming years.
As the first important initiative in the audit area, we launched a pilot experiment in 2019 to automate the audit of the accounting of the executive agencies.
In this pilot experiment, we will simultaneously use traditional and digital instruments. 29
Opinions Opinions: a contribution to better regulation One way to strengthen the Commission's approach to better regulation is to publish opinions on Commission proposals for new or amended legislation.
If these are legislative proposals with significant financial implications, the Court's opinions are required under EU law.
In addition, other institutions may ask us to deliver opinions on specific issues.
Our opinions will be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.
In 2019 we published three opinions: on the proposal concerning the European Union Intellectual Property Office, on a proposal for the financial regulation of the Single Resolution Committee (SRB) and on the proposal for the financial regulation of the Community Plant Variety Office.
Our comments on the new MFF in early 2019 were also published in our brief presentation of the EAFRH's comments on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.
This summary focused on the proposed procedure for setting expenditure priorities for the EU, the flexibility of the EU budget, performance orientation and administrative simplification, and accountability and audit arrangements.
The main basis for this analysis was a number of comments we made in the course of 2018 on the Commission's proposals, as well as our recent thematic papers and other reports on EU finances.
Balanced number of publications over the year We have reached a relatively balanced number of publications throughout the year at a peak in October when we published our annual reports.
31 32 Fighting fraud against the EU's financial interests Administrative agreement signed by OLAF The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is at the forefront of the fight against fraud to the detriment of the EU's financial interests.
We have adopted detailed guidelines for our auditors on how to deal with the risk of fraud.
We shall forward to OLAF any suspicion of fraud or any other illegal act affecting the financial interests of the EU, which arises during our audit work or is reported to us.
These cases will then be dealt with by OLAF, which will decide on possible investigations and, if necessary, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
In 2019, we also signed an administrative agreement setting out the operational provisions for our cooperation with OLAF, including the coordination of training, workshops and staff exchanges.
10 cases of suspected fraud have been forwarded to OLAF We are the external auditor of the EU.
Our tests are not specifically designed to detect fraud.
Nevertheless, our auditors regularly identify a number of cases in which they suspect fraudulent activities.
In 2019, we reported to OLAF 10 cases of suspected fraud (2018: nine cases), eight of which we encountered in the course of our audits, and two cases resulting from information provided by third parties.
Additional information on the nature of these suspected frauds and the resulting recoveries, as recommended by OLAF, can be found in our annual report on the EU's general budget.
In 2019, we also published two special reports closely related to the fight against fraud in EU expenditure: Special Report No. 01/2019 "Combating fraud in EU expenditure: action must be taken" and Special Report No. 06/2019 "Combating fraud in EU cohesion expenditure: administrative authorities must step up detection, response and coordination".
33 Finally, we dedicated a special issue of the ECA Journal to combating fraud and corruption and protecting the EU's financial interests.
Focus on sustainability The UN Sustainable Development Goals at the heart of our audit work In recent years, in which we focused on environmental and climate issues, issues of sustainability were issues of outstanding importance.
In 2019, our work on sustainability was complemented by the analysis of sustainability reporting.
This analysis provided an overview of how the EU institutions publish sustainability information and how they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We also organised a conference – the ERAH Forum on Sustainability Reporting – to raise awareness of the issue and bring important stakeholders together.
In July, we attended a meeting of SAIs presidents and stakeholders on the topic "ORCs move something: review the implementation of the SDGs" at the high-level political UN Forum for the 2030 Agenda.
Finally, we published a special issue of the ECA Journal on the SDGs.
Audit team: analysis "Sustainability reporting: an inventory of EU institutions, bodies and agencies".
Institutional relations Continuous increase in presentations to the European Parliament, the Council and the national parliaments We work closely with the European Parliament (EP), the Council and the national parliaments in the Member States, as the impact of our work depends to a large extent on the benefits that these institutions derive from our audit results and recommendations.
Our audit reports will be presented to the relevant committees of the European Parliament and the Council working groups.
We are also presenting our annual reports and our special reports and analyses to the national parliaments.
In 2019, the presentations of our reports for these institutional addressees continued to increase, mainly as a result of a significant increase in presentations to national parliaments.
At the same time, due to the parliamentary break, fewer presentations took place in the EP from mid-April to September 2019. 34
Meeting with the newly elected Presidents of the EU Institutions 2019 was a year of change at the head of many EU institutions: after their election, our President met with the President of the European Parliament, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council.
35 EurH President Lehne with EP President David Sassoli, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the Council Charles Michel.
European Parliament Our members and audit teams are regularly invited by the committees and bodies of the European Parliament – and in particular by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
In 2019, due to the elections to the European Parliament in May 2019, special conditions prevailed insofar as the parliamentary committees' meetings paused in mid-April and then started again in September.
We presented 14 committees 31 special reports and 10 analyses (2018: 39 reports and 14 committees).
Following the elections, we launched an awareness-raising campaign to inform Members of the European Parliament about our activities as external auditors of the EU.
We also organised a series of workshops for the staff of the EP.
Finally, in October 2019, we set up a publication portal that will not only allow members of the EP but also the general public more user-friendly access to our reports. 36
Council of the European Union In 2019, our audit teams presented 22 Council working groups and two committees with 26 special reports (2018: 40 reports and 27 working groups).
We also presented two analyses: one to the Committee on Budgets during an informal Council meeting in Romania and another to the working group on the 2030 Agenda.
We also participated in an exchange of views with the Committee on Financial Services on the agreement with the European Central Bank and the Committee on Budgets on our draft budget for 2020 and presented our 2020 work programme in December 2019.
In October 2019, the President of the Euro Group paid us a visit to discuss the state of play and future reforms of the Economic and Monetary Union and our potential contribution in the area of financial and economic governance in the EU.
In addition, the Chairman of the Euro Group Working Group met with our members in May 2019.
Member State governments and national parliaments More appearances in national parliaments Our members regularly visit national parliaments and governments.
In 2019, we held 90 presentations in 21 Member States (2018: 50 presentations in 14 Member States).
This is the highest number so far. 37
European Commission Exchange of views with our audited high-level bodies For years, it has been common practice for our members to hold an annual meeting with their counterparts at the Commission.
These meetings provide an opportunity to take stock and to reflect on how our cooperation can be further improved.
European Central Bank In June 2019, this tradition continued when President Jean-Claude Juncker invited our members to an exchange of views with the College of Commissioners in Brussels.
In October 2019, we signed an agreement with the European Central Bank which sets out the practical arrangements for the exchange of information on the supervisory activities of the European Central Bank for our auditors.
Cooperation with Supreme Audit Institutions (ORKB) Contact Committee of the EU-ORKB Annual Meeting 2019 in Poland Our cooperation with the EU-ORKB takes place primarily within the framework of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the EU-ORKB.
This network of EU-ORKBs allows us to promote the activities of independent external financial control in the EU and its Member States.
In June 2019, we attended the annual meeting hosted by the SAIs of Poland, which also held the Presidency.
The discussions focused primarily on the challenges and opportunities that the Digital Europe brings to the EU-ORCs.
At this meeting we took over the chair of the Contact Committee, as we do every three years.
Contact Committee meeting, Warsaw, June 2019. 39
Online portal "Public financial control in the EU" In January 2019 we launched an online portal for financial control in the European Union.
This online portal provides information on the mandate, status, organisational structure, activity and output of the EU and its Member States' Supreme Audit Authorities.
Public Health Examination Board in the EU In December 2019, on behalf of the Contact Committee, we published a second Public Health Examination Board which provides information on the audits carried out throughout the European Union in the field of public health.
The Compendium provides background information on public health, its legal bases, its main objectives and related responsibilities at Member State and EU level, and outlines the main challenges facing the EU and its Member States in this regard.
It is based on current audit findings by the European Court of Auditors and the SAIs from 23 EU Member States.
In 2019, we started the preparatory work for a third exam compendium, which will be published in 2020 and will deal with the topic of cybersecurity. 40
INTOSAI In 2019, the ECA continued its active participation in the activities of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), in particular in its function as Vice-Chairman of the Technical Standards Committee (since December 2016) and as a member of the Sub-Committee for Auditing Accounting and Accounting, the Sub-Committee for Auditing Compliance with Legal Standards and the Sub-Committee for Economic Audits.
We also participated in the activities and projects of other INTOSAI working bodies, mainly in the areas of environmental assessment, big data, financial modernisation and regulatory reform as well as evaluation of public policies and programmes.
We were also involved in the INTOSAI task force for the professionalisation of auditors, the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI) and the ISSAI 200 revision project under the auspices of the Accounting and Accounting Subcommittee.
INTOSAI Congress (INCOSAI) in September 2019 in Moscow.
The conference discussed two main topics in detail: information technology for the development of public administration and the SAIs' contribution to national priorities and objectives.
EUROSAI We also took an active part in the activities of the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI), the European Regional Group of INTOSAI, in particular in its working groups on environmental assessment, IT audit and assessment of disaster relief as well as in its task force on audit and ethics.
We also participated in several workshops and seminars and, together with 14 other European SAIs, contributed to the publication of a joint report on air quality. In October 2019, we hosted the seventeenth annual meeting of the EUROSAI Working Group on Environmental Assessment and a joint conference on biodiversity. Finally, we attended the third joint conference of EUROSAI-ASOSAI on "New emerging issues and emergency situations" in Israel in March 2019, as well as the first joint seminar of EUROSAI-AFROSAI in Lisbon in November 2019, hosted by the Portuguese SAIs.
41 Annual meeting of the EUROSAI Working Group on Environmental Assessment, October 2019.
42 The SAIs of the EU candidate countries and potential EU candidate countries In addition, we support the SAIs of the candidate countries and potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey), primarily through a network comparable to the Contact Committee and through our support for activities coordinated by the OECD.
In 2019, 10 auditors from SAIs of the network took part in our internship program.
We also actively contributed to the network's meetings and activities, including addressing issues such as accounting policies with increased impact and digital auditing.
Peer reviews of other EU-ORKBs A peer review is an external independent review of one or more elements of the organisation and/or functioning of an SAI by a team of peers from one or more SAIs.
It does not constitute an examination, but an assessment and advice by peers, which takes place on a voluntary basis.
In 2019, a peer review team led by our Secretary General together with the SAIs of Poland and the United Kingdom conducted a peer review of the SAIs of Lithuania.
The main objective was to assess whether the audit practice of the Lithuanian SAIs was in line with international audit standards.
In December 2019, the final report was submitted to the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas). * This designation does not affect positions on status and is in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) and the opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo's declaration of independence.

Our upper management level Note: as of March 2020.
Performance Measurement We use Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to inform our management of the progress made towards our strategic goals, support the decision-making process and provide our institutional addressees with information about our performance.
These KPIs provide a comprehensive overview of how we work as an organisation in terms of dissemination, impact and perception.
In 2019 as planned 36 reports published We monitor the number and timing of reports published throughout the year.
In 2019 we published 36 reports: 25 special reports and 11 analyses.
This corresponds to the number of publications planned in the work programme.
Number of special reports and analyses published 47 In addition, we issued six annual reports, three opinions, 18 audit reports and four other publications.
A total of 67 publications were produced in the course of the year. 48
Media Presence Continuous increase in social media coverage We monitor media coverage of our work and our body, which can vary considerably depending on the topic and complexity of a report.
At the same time, external factors can strongly influence the media's interest in our publications.
This may be the case, for example, if the date of publication of a report coincides with an important event or political development in time, which may increase the public interest in the subject in question significantly.
In total, more than 50,000 free online articles and contributions were recorded on social media in 2019.
49 For 2019, we noted a significant increase in our social media contributions, which is also due to the more active use of these communication channels during the year.
Increased contacts with the press In 2019, we intensified our contacts with the press and the media.
We managed to do this by publishing o 61 press releases in 23 EU languages (2018: 76) as well as numerous briefings and hints for the media in certain languages; o 25 press briefings (2018: 20), including sector- and country-related press briefings in connection with the annual report.
These press briefings usually take place in Brussels.
We also received journalists working in Brussels and the Member States for on-the-spot visits and organised several briefings on selected reports for industry stakeholders, NGOs and think tanks.
Visit of journalists from Member States to Luxembourg in November 2019. 50
One million visitors to our website in 2019 exceeded the number of visits to our website for the first time.
In total, we recorded around 511,000 individual visitors.
More Followers in social media Throughout the year, we have seen an increase in our presence and engagement in social media – especially on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn – which are now an indispensable part of our communication activities and enable us to engage in direct dialogue with citizens.
At the end of 2019, our three social media accounts recorded around 29,500 followers (2018: around 22,500). 51
The impact and effectiveness of our work 88% of the stakeholders surveyed consider our audit reports to be useful We evaluate the likely impact and usefulness of our audit work on the basis of feedback from our stakeholders from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, EU agencies, Member States' permanent representations, Member States' public bodies and SAIs, NGOs, science, the media and other parties.
Since 2018, we have been requesting feedback from our stakeholders via anonymous electronic surveys on a selection of special reports and analyses as well as on the annual report.
These surveys will also enable stakeholders to give feedback on the quality of the reports and make general proposals on the Court's work.
In total, 88% of respondents confirmed the usefulness of our reports for their work in 2019 and 81% agreed with them.
52 Follow-up to our recommendations Almost all our recommendations implemented We determine the state of implementation of our recommendations on the basis of the follow-up carried out by our auditors.
For 2019, we analysed the recommendations we had made in our 2015 special reports and the annual report of the same year.
This analysis shows that 96% of the recommendations we made in our 2015 Annual Report and 94% of the recommendations in our 2015 Special Reports have been fully, largely or (at least) partially implemented. 53
Our staff staff staff allocation At the end of 2019, our institution had 853 permanent and scheduled posts (2018: 853 posts), of which 534 in the examination chambers, including 118 posts in the members' cabinets.
54 In addition, 75 contract staff and 16 seconded national experts were employed by the Court at the end of the year (2018: 76 and 15 respectively).
Recruitment Our recruitment policy follows the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions. Our employees have a broad academic and professional background.
In 2019, the Court hired 77 staff (2018: 79 staff): 17 officials, 33 temporary staff, 21 contract staff and six seconded national experts.
We also provided 55 internship places (2018: 60) for university graduates for periods of three to five months.
Age profile Almost three quarters (74%) of active staff at the end of 2019 are between 40 and 59 years old.
55 More than half of our directors and executive managers are 50 years old or older.
As a result, in the next five to 10 years, when these employees retire, there will be a renewal in leadership positions.
Equal opportunities The Court offers its employees equal opportunities at all levels of the organisation.
Overall, we have a balanced female and male share among our employees.
In 2019, about one third of our directors and executive managers will be women.
57 Supporting audit activities Professional training record number of training activities In 2019, we continued the diversification and expansion of the training offer for our staff.
We organized a record number of training courses, conferences, presentations and workshops on a variety of topics.
We also provided financial support to employees for their participation in externally organised courses and programmes for the acquisition or maintenance of professional qualifications and qualifications.
We also launched a program to develop leadership skills, which consists of courses, coaching and mentoring for employees who want to expand their leadership skills.
We supported the HR operations by training newly created pools of career consultants, mentors and internal intermediaries.
Overachieved for training days Newly we exceeded the requirement for professional training days (5 days of non-language-related training per year), which was set in accordance with the recommendations of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
Our examiners completed an average of 7.5 training days; on average, our non-audit staff accounted for 3.6 training days.
Cooperation in the field of further education In July 2019, the second Summer Academy for Public Financial Control and Accountability took place at the University of Pisa on the topic of "Digitalisation of Examination".
We also continued our cooperation with the University of Lorraine, within which we offered the fifth edition of the postgraduate course "Audit of public organisations and policies", which culminates in the Master's degree "Management of public organisations".
In addition, we launched a new postgraduate program on "Fundamentals of statistics applied to audit".
These programmes are now open to European Commission staff.
Finally, we intensified our cooperation with the International Audit Committee of NATO (IBAN) in the field of training.
In May 2019, the Court held a workshop on "Assessing the Union's Security and Defence Policy", which brought together auditors of the Commission, NATO, the European Defence Agency, the Joint Organisation for Arms Cooperation (OCCAR), the Athena Mechanism and several EU Supreme Audit Institutions.
Launching ECademy In addition, we have launched ECademy, an instrument that enables us to exchange course material, publish records of conferences and organize webinars with all those interested in public financial control in the EU and its Member States.
This e-learning platform is open to the general public free of charge at https://ecademy.eca.europa.eu.

Translation In 2019 we translated and revised more than 223,000 pages including external contracts (2018: 251 000).
We translate our publications into all official EU languages.
We also translate our correspondence with the authorities of the Member States into their national language, as required by law.
Our translators are also often involved in our audit activities by providing linguistic support during audit visits and the preparation of reports.
Information technology, working environment and innovation Transition to cloud-based services A major milestone is the transition to cloud-based services, which has generally been made available for various applications from end-users (IT, personnel, office equipment, security, etc.) an easy-to-use system.
A new action plan on IT security has achieved many of its goals, such as more effective and regular removal of software vulnerabilities, preventing unauthorized access to cloud services, reviewing information security management and improving our security monitoring capabilities.
Finally, an ambitious technical programme was implemented in 2019 to provide equipment and systems that allow all employees to work more flexibly, such as home office, teleconferencing and mobile work.
New open data access policy In 2019, we also adopted a new open data access policy.
The re-use of documents and the process of providing our data will be determined in cooperation with the Publications Office. 59
ECALab The ECALab, our interdisciplinary innovation laboratory team, has continued to research technologies such as text mining, artificial intelligence and process mining.
In 2019, ECALab also started supporting a number of audit tasks.
Technology and Innovation Network in the audit area In November 2019, we founded the EU-ORKB Technology and Innovation for Audit (TINA) network at the "Big and open data" conference held at our premises in Luxembourg.
Conference on "Big and open data", November 2019, Luxembourg.
In order to accompany the development of the European blockchain services infrastructure by the European Commission and the Member States on the basis of our "conceptual proof", a further EU-ORKB network on blockchain technology has been set up in the audit area. 60
Building The yard currently has three buildings ("K1, "K2" and "K3"), which form a single integrated technical unit.
K1 The K1 building, which was opened in 1988, has offices for up to 310 employees and meeting rooms.
The basements have parking spaces, technical facilities, storage rooms, the library and the main archive, while the entire top floor is used for technical installations.
The K1 building was modernised in 2008 to bring it into line with national health, safety and environmental requirements.
As far as possible, the technology in the K1 building was adapted to make compatibility with the buildings K2 and K3.
The basements have parking spaces, technical facilities, storage rooms and the fitness centre.
The remaining floors are used for offices for up to 241 employees, as well as meeting rooms, a conference room with interpreting booths, video conference rooms, a cafeteria and simple kitchen areas.
We are currently modernising the K2 building to optimise the organisation of its work areas and to update certain technical facilities.
A detailed study of this project was carried out in 2019 and work began at the end of the year.
As approved by the European Parliament and the Council in March 2014, the Court will use the remaining budget of the K3 construction project, which was completed a few years ago, to finance this modernisation. 61
The basements have parking spaces, technical facilities, storage rooms, unloading areas, waste storage facilities, printing houses, kitchens and archives.
In addition, there are offices for 503 employees, meeting rooms and an IT room in this building.
Based on the world's leading method for assessing and certifying the sustainability of buildings (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, BREEAM), the K3 building was rated "very good". 62
Further increase of our security measures In 2019, we took a number of measures to increase safety in our buildings in Luxembourg.
This included the establishment of a team of armed security personnel.
An agreement has been reached with the Luxembourg police to allow us to use their national training centres.
We also agreed with the European External Action Service to assist our auditors in their visits to countries at high risk.
63 Eduardo Ruiz García, Secretary General of the ECA, and Helga Schmid, Secretary General of the EEAS.
Environmental management As an EU institution, it is our duty to follow the principle of sound environmental management in all activities.
We strive to continue to systematically reduce our CO2 emissions and regularly analyse the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our activities.
Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 amounted to a total of 10 178 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), which represents a reduction of 3% compared to 2017.
We are proud of our EMAS certification for environmental management and audit: We successfully operate an EMAS-compliant environmental management system and fully meet the certification requirements of ISO 14001:2015.
In the last quarter of 2019, an external EMAS audit was carried out, which resulted in our EMAS certification being renewed for the period 2020-2022.
New initiatives such as the "plastic-free EurH" initiative are progressing as planned.
In 2019, we also set up four hives in our gardens in cooperation with the Luxembourg Ministry of Agriculture.
The bees are cared for by volunteers.
We assume that this will have a positive impact on the sustainability of pollinators in our environment. 64
Court's accountability Financial information The Court is financed from the general budget of the European Union, the budget of which falls under the heading of administrative expenditure.
For 2019, our budget amounted to around 147 million euros, of which 98 % were used throughout the year.
This represents less than 0.1% of total EU expenditure and around 1.5% of total EU administrative expenditure.

Internal and external audit Internal audit The Internal Audit Service advises the Court on risk management issues.
It provides independent and objective guarantees and provides advisory services designed to enhance and enhance the added value of the Court's activities.
It shall also report to the Internal Audit Committee, composed of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee shall regularly monitor progress on the various tasks set out in the annual work programme of the Internal Audit Service and ensure the independence of the Office.
In the course of 2019, the Internal Audit Service carried out three selected tasks: "Risks and challenges of the Audit Committee", "Travel expenses of members and high-level officials, expenses for representation purposes of members and use of the Court's vehicle fleet" and "occupational training activities of the Court".
Our risk management strategy and three annual declarations by subdelegated authorising officers were also examined.
In addition, the Internal Revision Service monitored the implementation of its previous recommendations by verifying that the agreed action plans have been implemented and advised on issues related to the Court's new internal control framework.
Our internal auditor did not identify any deficiencies that, due to their nature or extent, would seriously jeopardise the reliability of the internal control systems as a whole; these control systems had been introduced by the authorising officer by delegation to ensure the legality and regularity of the Court's financial operations in 2019.
External audit Our annual accounts are audited by an independent external auditor.
We attach great importance to this audit, as it shows that we apply the same transparency and accountability principles to ourselves as to the bodies we examine.
The auditor's report – PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à.r.l. – on the Court's financial statements for the financial year 2018 was published on 4 April 2019. 67
Audit opinions of our independent auditor – Financial year 2018 68 On the Court's annual accounts: "According to our assessment, the annual accounts give a true picture of the European Court of Auditors' financial and financial situation as at 31 December 2018 and the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in net assets for the year ending that reference date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2012, p.
OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1), and its subsequent amendments, hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Regulation", as well as Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p.
1) laying down rules for the application of the Financial Regulation and its subsequent amendments.'
Regarding the use of resources and the Court's control procedures: "In our work described in this report, we have not encountered situations from which we would have to conclude that, in all essential respects and taking into account the abovementioned assessment criteria, the funds allocated to the Court have not been used for the intended purposes and that the control procedures established do not provide the necessary assurance that the financial operations have been carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations."
Discharge for the financial year 2017 Like the other EU institutions, the Court is also subject to the discharge procedure.
In March 2019, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2017.
As in every year, we have carefully analysed all the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our audit and management responsibility, taken appropriate measures and reported to the European Parliament in detail on our follow-up.
Peer Review on our Ethics Framework Finally, in 2019 our ethics framework was subjected to an external expert review by the SAIs of Poland and Croatia.
The report was completed in January 2020. 69
Declaration by the authorising officer by delegation In accordance with Article 74(9) of the Financial Regulation Statement by the authorising officer by delegation The undersigned, Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, hereby declares in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation, or that the information contained in this report, as well as the additional internal information relating to the fulfilment of my duties, which contain financial and management information, including the results of the controls, is accurate and accurate, and or confirms with reasonable certainty that — the resources provided for the activities described in this report have been used for the intended purposes and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management — the control procedures set up are proportionate to the need for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and for the appropriate handling of fraud or suspicion of fraud — the costs and benefits of the controls.

EN 2013 Brief information on the audit of the EU Presentation of the annual reports of the European Court of Auditors for the financial year 2013
President's Preface 02 Each November, the European Court of Auditors reports on the results of its annual audits of EU financial management during the previous financial year.
On the basis of the audit evidence obtained, the Court provides a guarantee of reliability for the use of EU funds and highlights the greatest risk of improper use of EU funds.
The reports also contain recommendations for possible improvements in EU financial management.
In this way, the Court supports the European Parliament and the Council in the review of EU expenditure and helps to ensure that the accountability of EU citizens is effectively exercised.
This "In brief on the audit of the EU in 2013" summarises and explains the main findings in our 2013 Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget and the European Development Funds.
As in previous years, the reports show the extent to which EU and national financial management actors have provided a true picture of financial management in their reports, ensured the application of EU financial rules and complied with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
2013 was the last year of a seven-year programming period and we publish our annual reports on this financial year in a transition period that is important for the EU and its finances.
As our reports show, a new European Parliament and a new Commission are facing both long-standing and new challenges for financial management and accountability in the 2014-2020 programming period which is now under way.
The continued pressure on EU and national finances requires careful management and control of EU funds, as well as better forecasts of long-term financing needs.
In particular, our reports highlight the need for the Commission and the authorities of the Member States to make greater use of EU funding to achieve results that could not be achieved equally efficiently or effectively by other means.
At the same time, the Court's audit results show that more can and should be done to ensure that EU spending is in line with the rules.
The Court will be pleased to take the opportunity to assist the new European Parliament and the new Commission in solving these and other problems of financial management and accountability at EU level.
To this end, we have also developed two landscape analyses on the basis of our audit experience, highlighting the main challenges facing the EU in the areas of accounting, audit and financial management.

Overall results 04 Key statements Summary of the Statement of Assurance for 2013 The European Court of Auditors (EuRH, "the Court") gives an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts of the European Union for 2013.
The total revenue for 2013 is legal and correct.
Commitments for 2013 are overall legal and regular.
Payments for 2013 are significantly affected by errors.
The Court therefore gives a failed opinion on its legality and regularity.
The text of the Statement of Assurance is set out in Chapter 1 of the 2013 Annual Report. ο The Court estimates the error rate, which measures the extent of the irregularities, at 4.7% for 2013. This figure is close to the error rate for 2012 (4.8%) and consistently above the materiality threshold of 2%. ο Overall, the monitoring and control systems examined – with significant differences between Member States – ensured the regularity of payments. ο The two areas of expenditure, regional policy, transport and energy, with an error rate of 6.9% and rural development, environment, fisheries and health, with an error rate of 6.7%, were the most erroneous.
In the overall shared management, i.e. taking into account the areas of agriculture: market support and direct payments as well as employment and social affairs, the estimated error rate was 5.2 %. ο Corrections and recoveries by the authorities in the Member States and the Commission had a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
Overall results 05 Proper use of EU funds The EU funds for 2013 Every year, the Court reviews EU revenue and expenditure and assesses, in its audit opinion, the reliability of the annual accounts and the consistency of the revenue and expenditure operations with the rules and legislation in force.
In 2013, the total expenditure from the EU budget amounted to 148.5 billion euros or around 290 euros per citizen.
These expenditures represent about one per cent of the gross national income of the EU and represent about two per cent of the total public expenditure of the EU Member States.
The EU budget is adopted annually by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of a seven-year financial framework.
The Commission's primary task is to ensure that the budget is spent properly.
The Commission shares this task with the EU Member States for around 80% of expenditure, particularly in the fields of agriculture and cohesion.
Where do the funds come from?
The EU budget is financed from various sources.
The largest share is made up of payments made by Member States on the basis of their gross national income (EUR 110.0 billion).
Other sources include Member States' payments based on VAT (EUR 14.5 billion) and customs duties and agricultural duties (EUR 15.4 billion).
The annual EU budget is spent in a wide range of policy areas (see Graph 1).
Payments are used to promote activities as diverse as research projects, training unemployed people or agricultural production.
Overall results 06 Expenditure for 2013 6.9% Administrative expenditure and related expenditure 8.9% Research and other internal policies 9.4% Employment and social affairs 9.9% Rural development, environment, fisheries and health 4.2% External relations, external assistance and enlargement Total expenditure 2013 148.5 billion EUR 30.4% Regional policy, transport and energy 30.3% Agriculture: market support and direct payments Audit findings for 2013 A key element of the Court's audit work is the examination of samples of operations taken from all parts of the EU budget in order to arrive at statistical estimates of the error of revenue and the various areas of expenditure.
The results for 2013 are summarised in Figure 2.
Further information on the Court's audit approach and the estimation of the most likely error rate can be found on page 35.

Overall results 07 For 2013, the Court concludes that revenue was not significantly affected by errors.
For the expenditure budget as a whole, the estimated error rate is 4.7%, resulting in a failure to assess the regularity of expenditure (explanation of the term ‘order-by-order' can be found on page 36).
For further information on the various areas of expenditure, see pages 18 to 34 and the corresponding chapters of the annual report for the financial year 2013.

This figure is close to the error rate for 2012 (4.8%) and consistently above the 2 % materiality threshold (see Graph 4). Estimated error rate for the EU budget as a whole (2007-2013) EU expenditure 10 % 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% 6.9% 5.2 % 4.8% 4.7% 3.3% 3.7% 2007 2008 Upper error limit 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 % Estimated error rate Lower error limit Note: The Court uses statistical standard methods to estimate the most likely error rate.
The Court is 95 % sure that the error rate for the population concerned is between the lower error limit and the upper error limit.
Further details can be found in Annex 1.1 and Figure 1.3 of Chapter 1 of the Annual Report.
Overall results 09 Errors, waste and fraud The Court's estimated error rate is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste.
It is a damage to the funds that should not have been paid out because they have not been used in accordance with the legislation in force.
Typical errors include payments for ineligible expenditure or purchases where the procurement rules have not been properly applied.
Fraud is a deliberate act of deception with the aim of gaining advantages.
The Court shall forward cases to OLAF (the European Union Anti-Fraud Office) which it is responsible for carrying out any further investigations in cooperation with the authorities in the Member States, in the course of its audits and in which it suspects fraud.
A comparison of the error rates estimated for the different areas of expenditure is shown in Figure 5.
Higher quotas in the field of research and other internal policies, administrative expenditure and related expenditure have been offset by lower quotas in the areas of rural development, environment, fisheries and health, as well as external relations, external assistance and enlargement.
As in 2012, the two areas of expenditure were the most flawed: regional policy, transport and energy and rural development, environment, fisheries and health.
These two areas together with the other two areas of shared management (agriculture: market support and direct payments and employment and social affairs) have an estimated error rate of 5.2%.
For all other operational expenditure (mainly managed directly by the Commission), the estimated error rate was 3.7 %.
In addition, the Court found an estimated error rate of 1.0% in administrative expenditure.

Overall results 12 The Court analyses the contribution of the various types of error and the different areas of expenditure to the estimated total error rate (see Graph 6).
Expenditure that did not meet the necessary conditions to be claimed under EU-funded projects had the largest share of the estimated total error rate (inclusion of ineligible costs in cost statements: 39% or 1.8 percentage points of the estimated total error rate).
Second, there were projects where either the object(s) financed or the beneficiary should not have been funded under the applicable rules (non-eligible projects/activities or beneficiaries: 22 % or 1.1 percentage points of the estimated total error rate).
As the largest expenditure area with the highest estimated error rate, regional policy, transport and energy contribute by far the most to the estimated overall error rate (44% or 2.1 percentage points of the estimated total error rate).
The agricultural sector: market support and direct payments, where expenditure was almost the same, contribute roughly half as much to the estimated overall error rate.
Corrective measures have a positive impact on the error rate Member States and the Commission are applying corrective measures to protect the EU budget in cases of ineffective control systems or irregular expenditure.
If such corrective measures had not been taken in respect of the 2013 payments audited by the Court, the estimated total error rate would have been 6,3 % instead of 4,7 %.
However, the estimated error rate could be significantly further reduced by better application of existing control systems and corrective measures.
The Court noted that the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the errors in a large part of the error in the areas of shared management before requesting a refund from the Commission.
For example, this would have reduced the estimated error rate in regional policy, transport and energy from 6.9% to 3.9%, in rural development, environment, fisheries and health from 6.7% to 2.0% and in employment and social affairs from 3.1% to 1.9%.
New challenges for the presentation of reliable financial information Reporting on the corrective adjustments mentioned above does not clearly distinguish between the main types of corrective adjustments and the information is largely provided outside the accounting system.
This makes more detailed analysis more difficult and reduces the accuracy of the figures presented in the accounts and related financial reporting.
A further development is the increasing use of financial instruments to support investment in potentially economically viable projects in the form of loans, guarantees, equity and other risk mechanisms.
Due to its complex structure, financial instruments require particular care in assessing and recording them in accordance with internationally recognised public sector accounting principles.
Overall results 13 Continuous increase in amounts to be financed from future budgets Among the main features of the budget and financial management of the EU in 2013 are: ο a strong increase in the volume of payments that the Commission was allowed to make through amending budgets: 9.6% of the initial budget; ο a sustained increase in commitments that will give rise to payments in the future (by 2.6%) despite the high level of payment; ο an unchanged period (on average more than two years) between the date of the initial commitment and the date on which the expenditure declarations are accepted by the Commission; ο only 37% of the appropriations allocated to financial instruments were disbursed to final beneficiaries at the end of 2012; ο repayments, interest and dividends of EUR 259 million accumulated since 2008 were not recognised as revenue.
What are obligations and payments?
The EU budget consists of two elements: obligations (payments to be paid in the current or coming years) and payments (covering payments paid in the current year).
Payments can only be made against valid commitments.
The annual ceilings for commitments and payments are laid down in the multiannual financial framework agreed by the Council and Parliament.
The nature of EU spending programmes, in particular the long period between commitment and payment, is putting increasing pressure on future payment budgets.
This is reflected in a significantly higher budget for payments in 2013, and this trend will continue in a similar way in future budgets.
Overall Results 14 How can budgetary management and financial management be improved, according to the Court, by providing ο more meaningful information on the operation of the correction mechanisms (time, origin and nature) and the accuracy of the corresponding figures by recording information within traditional accounting systems; ο gathering and evaluating all financial instruments and financial instruments in accordance with internationally recognised accounting principles for the public sector, in particular by means of reliable procedures for the identification and recording of impairments; ο providing information on cash resources held until payment to final beneficiaries; ο preparing and publishing a long-term cash flow forecast that is updated annually; this would make it easier for the stakeholders concerned to identify future payment needs and set budget priorities. ο improving?

Full information on the main audit findings can be found in Chapter 1 "Declaration of reliability and related statements" of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
Overall results 15 EU funds and the provision of results EU funds should be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management (sparability, efficiency and effectiveness).
Against this background, it is necessary to achieve good performance inputs (financial, personnel, material, organisational or regulatory resources required for the implementation of the programme), outputs (to be achieved within the framework of the programme), results (immediate changes caused by the programme for direct stakeholders or direct beneficiaries) and effects (long-term societal changes, at least partly due to EU action).
The Court assesses these aspects in its economic audits.
The emphasis is not enough on performance In the 2007-2013 programming period, the use of EU funds focused on absorption (use it or loose it – lapse in non-use) and compliance with legislation and not good performance.
The choice of projects for EU funding was, for example, the first priority was the need for the use of available EU funds, second was the need to comply with the rules and third – and only to a certain extent – was the achievement of results and impacts.
This lack of emphasis on performance is a crucial weak point in the way a large part of the EU budget is built up.
According to the Commission, the 2014-2020 programming period focuses more on performance, with performance-related reserves being the main incentive.
By means of these reserves, the Commission will hold back 6% of the funds allocated to individual Member States until the performance is found to be satisfactory.
However, in practice, input and output indicators will continue to be largely decisive for the release of funds.
The Commission will use result indicators only in a few areas.
The effectiveness of performance reserves will depend on the success of the Commission in negotiating appropriate targets and milestones at the beginning of the programming period and in obtaining accurate, reliable and up-to-date data from Member States to determine whether the targets have been achieved.
The reporting framework is not suitable for the desired performance culture Performance reporting is spread across several general reports at the level of the general budget.
These reports do not provide any information on progress towards achieving the Europe 2020 Strategy objectives, nor do they provide a comprehensive overview of the results in the form of EU added value.
However, the fourth evaluation report is a step in the right direction, in that it seeks to link the main financial programmes with the available performance information relevant to the Europe 2020 strategy.
At the level of each Directorate-General of the Commission, performance objectives for policy areas within their respective responsibilities are defined in the management plans, which are then reported in the annual activity reports.
The Court's analysis of the management plans and annual activity reports of the Commission's Directorates-General has shown that the assurance of reliability is limited to aspects of regularity and internal control and does not take performance aspects into account.
Moreover, the objectives would be too general to be used for management purposes and the selected indicators are not always suitable for performance measurement.
Overall results 16 The added value of EU expenditure is not always demonstrated The 19 special reports adopted by the Court in 2013 deal with a wide range of issues in economic impact assessments and assess whether EU intervention has been carried out in accordance with the principles of sound financial management (sparability, efficiency and effectiveness).
The Court examined the lessons to be learned from its 2013 Special Reports on the development of the new programmes and projects for the 2014-2020 programming period and concluded that ο The EU added value could not always be ensured. ο In several cases, there were potential take-off effects, i.e. the beneficiaries had carried out the activity without EU funding.
Example: European Globalisation Adjustment Fund The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund compensates workers affected by mass redundancies.
The Court noted that one third of the funding was used for measures that would have been paid by Member States anyway (Special Report No 7/2013 "Has the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provided an EU added value in the reintegration of redundant workers?").
Example: Risk-Sharing Finance Facility The Commission had not sufficiently demonstrated that EU funds provided under the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (financial instrument intended to facilitate access to debt financing in the field of research) lead to higher investments than the beneficiaries would make without public funds (Special Report No 2/2013 "Did the Commission ensure the efficient implementation of the Seventh Research Framework Programme?").
Overall results 17 Most of the Court's recommendations have been implemented The follow-up to the Court's recommendations as a result of economic audits is a key part of the accountability cycle and can help the Commission effectively implement the recommendations contained in the reports.
The Court analysed how the Commission continued to address recommendations made in eight special reports adopted in 2007-2010 and noted that the Commission had implemented either fully or largely 79 % of the recommendations.
The Court recommends that the Commission: ο The Commission should tighten up the framework for its performance reporting at the next revision of the Financial Regulation. ο The Commission should ensure that the evaluation report contains a summary of all available information on the progress made towards achieving the Europe 2020 objectives. ο The Commission should further develop its performance management and reporting system so that it can take responsibility for the sound financial management and the contribution of the EU budget to political success. ο Would you like to know more?
Full information on the Court's assessment of performance can be found in Chapter 10 "EU budget and performance report" of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the 2013 budget.
All special reports are available on the Court's website: http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/ Pages/AuditReportsOpinions.aspx.
The contributions calculated on the basis of the gross national income (GNI) of the Member States or the VAT collected by the Member States accounted for 74 % and 10 % of the revenue respectively in 2013.
Import duties and the production levy on sugar collected by the authorities in the Member States on behalf of the EU accounted for 10 % of the EU's revenue, while the remaining 6 % came from other revenue.
Explanation on the audit of EU revenue EU revenue based on GNI and VAT is calculated on the basis of macroeconomic statistics and estimates provided by Member States.
The Court's audit of the regularity of the underlying transactions relates to the processing of these data by the Commission, but not to the initial collection of these data by the authorities in the Member States.
Consequently, the Court's conclusion on the audit concerns the impact of any errors made by the Commission on the total amount of revenue.
With regard to customs duties, the Court is examining how the Commission deals with the safeguards submitted by the Member States on the claims found.
These data are not sufficiently harmonised among Member States.
A reservation is an instrument that allows the possibility of correction to be kept open for a contested element in GNI data transmitted by a Member State.
There is a general reservation regarding the Greek GNI data for 2008 and 2009, as the data are still based on provisional estimates.
This aspect is part of a problem that affects Greece's national accounts.
Detailed analysis of revenue and expenditure sectors 19 The customs authorities of the Member States shall carry out checks to verify that importers comply with customs and import rules.
The Court noted that the quality of these controls was very different in the Member States visited.
This may result in importers deciding to notify goods in a Member State other than the Member State in which they are established in order to reduce the likelihood of a check and to make it more difficult to collect the duties due.
One example of this practice seems to be the case of an importer that unloaded Chinese textiles in Hamburg (Germany) who transported them to Rotterdam, where they were declared for free circulation, and then sent them to Poland for final sale.
Our recommendations The Court recommends that the Commission: ο The Commission should work to ensure that Member States harmonise their methods for calculating data on unobserved economic activity. ο The Commission should draw up a detailed action plan with clear milestones and monitor the implementation of this action plan closely in order to tackle the problems encountered in the preparation of Greece's national accounts. ο The Commission should set minimum standards for the controls of the Member States' customs authorities in order to enable a more targeted focus on high-risk importers.

Full information on the Court's audit of EU revenue can be found in Chapter 2 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
20 This area of expenditure comprises the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), one of the two main instruments of the EU's common agricultural policy.
The aim of this policy is to increase the productivity of agriculture, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural population, to stabilise markets, to ensure supply and to ensure that consumers are supplied at reasonable prices.
Expenditure shall be subject to shared management with Member States.
Yes Estimated error rate: 3.6% (2012: 3.8%) Control systems under investigation: conditionally effective Most expenditure in this area is calculated on the basis of agricultural land.
Many quantifiable errors are the result of inaccuracies in the beneficiaries' applications, most often overlying area data (see example).
Example: Overdeclarations – application for aid for non-eligible areas In Germany, Ireland, Greece, France, Poland and Romania*, some areas declared as permanent grassland for which payments were made were actually fully or partially covered with uneligible vegetation (density of bushes or trees).
No EU aid should have been paid for these non-eligible areas.
In Greece, this error occurred because such areas were classified as eligible grassland and were included in the agricultural parcel identification system accordingly. * Note on the designation of Member States in the examples: the sampling approach applied by the Court does not examine operations every year in each Member State, beneficiary country and/or region.
Examples of errors are intended to illustrate the most common types of errors.
They do not form the basis for conclusions on the Member States, beneficiary countries and/or regions concerned.
For all direct aid schemes under the EAGF, beneficiaries of EU aid are legally obliged to "obtain cross-compliance" which relates to environmental protection, human, animal and plant health and animal welfare, as well as to the conservation of land in good agricultural and environmental conditions.
If farmers fail to meet these obligations, their aid will be reduced.
In the course of its audits, the Court found that 25 % of the transactions involved in these obligations were infringing.
In the event of a significant number of errors, the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before a refund was requested from the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors before the Commission's expenditure was reported, the estimated error rate in this area would have been 2,5 %.
More detailed analysis of revenue and expenditure sectors 21 The Court's analysis of the integrated management and control systems (IPCoS) in four Member States (Germany, Ireland, France and Italy) revealed weaknesses in the administrative control procedures and the quality of the databases in three Member States (Ireland, France and Italy), ο shortcomings in the quality of on-the-spot checks in two Member States (Germany and Italy), ο weaknesses in the recovery procedures in two Member States (Ireland and Italy).
In spite of the shortcomings identified during the audit, the IACS makes a significant contribution to preventing errors in the expenditure covered by this system.
In the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or later, producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector can receive EU aid.
Certain conditions regarding the number and relative size of member producers must be fulfilled for recognition as a producer group.
The Court found that nine out of the 40 producer groups examined in Poland did not meet these conditions.
In its 2013 Annual Activity Report, the Commission reported that it had reserved a risk amount of 25 % of the total expenditure under the measure in question in Poland.
Our recommendations The Court makes the following recommendations: ο The Commission and the Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that the full potential of the IACS is realised; for example, they should ensure that the eligibility and size of agricultural parcels are properly assessed and covered. ο The Commission should monitor the corrective measures related to the shortcomings in EU aid to producer groups in Poland.

The Court's full information on the Court's audit of EU expenditure on market support and direct payments in the agricultural sector can be found in Chapter 3 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
22 This area of expenditure covers the policy areas "rural development", "climate and environmental policy", "maritime affairs and fisheries", and "health and consumer protection".
Of the payments in this area, 88% are to the detriment of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Expenditure shall be subject to shared management with the Member States.
The EAFRD will co-finance rural development expenditure under relevant programmes in the Member States.
Expenditure covers land-related measures (such as agri-environmental payments and compensation to farmers in areas with natural handicaps) and non-area-related measures (such as modernisation of agricultural holdings and basic services for the rural economy and population).
Yes Estimated error rate: 6.7% (2012: 7.9%) Control systems under investigation: Conditionally effective Most errors were due to the fact that the conditions for aid were not met, in particular the following conditions: agri-environmental obligations (see example), special requirements for investment projects and procurement rules.
Example: non-compliance with agri-environmental obligations A farmer in Sardinia (Italy) received compensation for the non-use of polluting plant protection products in the cultivation of artichokes.
In its on-the-spot check, the Court found that the beneficiary had used such plant protection products 12 times during the period under review.
Therefore, the payment of aid was not considered.
Similar cases of non-compliance with agri-environmental commitments have also been identified in the Piedmont region (Italy) as well as in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.
Detailed examination of the revenue and expenditure sectors 23 In the case of a significant number of error-laden transactions, the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before a refund was requested from the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors before the Commission's expenditure was reported, the estimated error rate in this area would have been 2.0 %.
The Court's examination of the control systems for rural development revealed: ο shortcomings in the control of eligibility conditions, e.g. non-recovery of non-eligible VAT amounts or the risk of double financing (in seven of the eight Member States examined – Germany, Spain, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovenia; Poland was the exception); ο inadequate assessment of the plausibility of costs (in all four Member States examined – Italy, Latvia, Poland and Romania); ο shortcomings in the design and implementation of cross-compliance controls (in all four of the Member States examined – Czech Republic, Spain, Italy and Malta); the cross-compliance obligations require beneficiaries to meet specific conditions, such as environmental and social standards, in order to qualify for aid; ο shortcomings in the control of award rules (in all three Member States examined – Italy, Latvia and Poland; see for example).
For example, insufficient controls on the procurement rules by the Member State In Latvia, the paying agency was the beneficiary of EUR 2 million of EAFRD aid to finance its outsourced IT system, which was subject to public procurement rules.
The Court noted that several serious errors had occurred in the procurement process for the IT system and the subsequent data banks.
For example, instead of an open or restricted procedure, as provided for in the legislation, the paying agency applied a negotiation procedure.
Due to non-compliance with the required procedures, expenditure is not eligible for EU funding.
Our recommendations The Court makes the following recommendations for rural development: ο Member States should improve the implementation of their existing administrative controls by using all relevant information available to paying agencies.
In this way, the majority of the errors could be detected and corrected. ο Member States should ensure that the Action Plans aimed at addressing the high estimated level of rural development include all regions and take into account all measures, in particular investment measures, and that they take account of the Commission and the Court's audit findings.

More detailed analysis of the revenue and expenditure areas Regional policy, transport and energy EUR 45.5 billion Subject of our audit 24 This audit covered regional policy (which accounts for 96% of payments in this area of expenditure), mainly financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF).
The aim of regional policy is to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by reducing the disparities in development between the different regions.
Expenditure on regional policies is subject to shared management by the Commission and the Member States, with projects co-financed under approved spending programmes.
The remaining 4% of this audited expenditure covers transport and energy policy areas.
Transport and energy policy aims to provide European citizens and businesses with safe, sustainable and competitive transport and energy systems and services.
These expenditure shall be managed directly by the Commission.
Yes Estimated likely error rate: 6.9% (2012: 6.8%) Control systems investigated: Conditionally effective The Court found serious errors in the award of public contracts, accounting for 39% of the Court's estimated error rate.
The cumulative value of the 122 awarded procedures audited is estimated at EUR 4.2 billion.
Example: Unjustified free-hand contracts for additional construction work at the passenger terminal of an airport in Germany were awarded free-hand to the original contractor.
This additional work was necessary because of man-made preparation, planning and implementation of the project and not due to unforeseen circumstances.
In such cases, a free-handed award is inadmissible and the additional work should therefore have been advertised.
Similar cases of unjustified hands-free award were found in projects in Belgium, the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Germany, as well as in Spain, Italy and Sweden.
Further consideration of revenue and expenditure sectors 25 The Court's auditors also check whether EU state aid rules are complied with.
Illegal State aid confers an unjustified advantage on the beneficiary bodies and therefore affects the internal market.
Errors related to State aid accounted for 17% of the estimated error rate in this area (see example).
Example: State aid for a profitable project of a small or medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) in Slovenia has been granted for research and development activities in the automotive industry.
However, the SME was wholly owned by large companies and undertook its research activities exclusively for them.
As more stringent public funding rules apply to large companies, the company was not entitled to the entire subsidy.
Similar cases were found in Bulgaria and Hungary.
In the case of a significant number of error cases, the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the errors before the Commission had been requested to obtain them.
If this information had been used to correct errors before the Commission's expenditure was reported, the estimated error rate in this area would have been 3,9 %.
The Court's auditors also noted that in 2013 financial instruments continued to receive low levels of disbursement to final beneficiaries.
The funds in question support companies or urban development projects through equity investments, loans or guarantees.
The funds will be provided when their legal structure has been established and will be used to support projects.
A total of 940 financial instruments have been set up in 25 Member States, worth around EUR 12.6 billion.
Our recommendations The Court recommends to the Commission that: ο The Commission should require Member States to explicitly confirm in their administrative declarations the effectiveness of the primary controls carried out by the managing authority and the certifying authority. ο The Commission should carry out a thorough evaluation of the ongoing problem of primary controls carried out by authorities in the Member States during the 2007-2013 programming period, as required by the Financial Regulation. ο The Commission should analyse the reasons for the frequency of breaches of EU state aid rules. ο The Commission should reduce the continuing delays in disbursement of EU funds through financial instruments. ο Would you like to know more?
Full information on the Court's audit of EU expenditure on regional policy, transport and energy can be found in Chapter 5 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
The audit covered employment and social expenditure, which forms part of the EU's cohesion policy.
The main objectives of spending in this area are to combat unemployment, develop human resources and promote integration into the labour market.
Employment and social policy is implemented mainly through the European Social Fund (ESF): 98% of the payments made in 2013 in this area of expenditure were charged to this fund.
The ESF will support investment in human capital in the form of training and other employment measures.
In a private school in Portugal, the full salary of the school director was charged to the EU project, although he also had other tasks to perform.
In addition, the ceiling for co-financing salaries has not been respected.
The Court also found similar findings in projects in Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.
In the case of a significant number of errors, the authorities in the Member States have had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before the Commission has been requested to do so.
If this information had been used to correct errors before the Commission's expenditure was reported, the estimated error rate in this area would have been 1.8%.
Further consideration of revenue and expenditure areas 27 On the recommendation of the Court and with a view to reducing the likelihood of errors and administrative burdens for the promoters, the application of lump sums and flat rates was extended in 2009 instead of the reimbursement of ‘actual costs'.
In its 2013 audit, the Court did not detect any quantifiable errors in relation to the application of lump sums and flat rates.
This suggests that projects whose costs are reported using such payment options are less error-prone.
Our recommendations The Court recommends to the Commission that: ο The Commission should invite Member States to strengthen controls on procurement rules, non-project-related costs or projects without EU added value. ο The Commission should ensure that Member States address the problem of imposing higher levels of staff costs on EU projects than on national funded projects. ο The Commission should ensure that Member States have taken into account all the simplification options provided for in the regulations for the European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2014-2020.

Full information on the Court's audit of EU expenditure on employment and social affairs can be found in Chapter 6 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
28 This expenditure covers expenditure on external relations, development and humanitarian assistance, as well as actions for candidate countries and candidate countries.
The development projects are spread across more than 150 countries around the world and implementation bodies vary considerably in size and experience.
Support for EU funding projects is conditional on compliance with conditions laid down in specific financing agreements, as well as compliance with other requirements, such as tendering and procurement procedures.
Expenditure is managed either directly by the Commission's Directorates-General – through the central Commission services in Brussels or EU delegations in the beneficiary countries – or jointly with international organisations.
Yes Estimated error rate: 2.6% (2012: 3.3%) Control systems under investigation: Effective Most errors concerned ineligible expenditure at final beneficiaries level, such as expenditure incurred outside the eligibility period, inclusion of ineligible expenditure in project cost statements (e.g. VAT, unwarranted personnel costs or overheads) and not backed up by adequate supporting documents.
The Commission validated pre-accession expenditure for a total of EUR 150 million, although it was not confirmed by evidence that the expenditure was incurred and eligible.
The validated amounts were based on Commission estimates rather than on incurred, paid and accepted costs, supported by relevant evidence.
Following the Court's detection of this systematic error, the Commission corrected the accounting operations in question.
Example: Undisbursed expenditure The Commission signed an agreement on EUR 9.5 million with the United Nations Development Programme to promote social development in Moldova.
In 2013, the Commission accepted contracts worth EUR 1.8 million for reimbursement for which no underlying expenditure had yet been incurred.
A closer look at revenue and expenditure sectors 29 Commission Directorate-General EuropeAid manages most of the EU's expenditure in the field of external action from the budget.
The EuropeAid systems studied are assessed as being of limited effectiveness.
In May 2013, EuropeAid adopted an action plan to address the main identified shortcomings.
Our recommendations The Court recommends to the Commission that: ο The Commission should ensure that the instructions for staff indicate that final management of expenditure should be based only on expenditure actually incurred and should not be based on own estimates.
The Commission has already agreed to amend its final expenditure procedure accordingly. Would you like to know more?
The full information on the Court's examination of EU expenditure on external relations, external assistance and enlargement can be found in Chapter 7 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
30 The main component of this expenditure is research and innovation projects, which amounted to EUR 7.7 billion in payments in 2013.
The other internal policies concern spending on a number of policy objectives, including education and culture, security, migration and measures to address the consequences of the financial crisis.
Most of the expenditure is managed directly by the Commission.
Yes Estimated error rate: 4.6% (2012: 3.9%) Control systems under investigation: conditionally effective With most payments in this area of expenditure, the Commission is reimbursing costs claimed by beneficiaries in project cost statements.
Errors arise when beneficiaries report ineligible costs that are not detected by the control systems prior to reimbursement by the Commission.
35% of the estimated error rate is due to incorrectly calculated or ineligible personnel costs.
Among other things, it claims the estimated and not the actual personnel costs and working hours that have not been spent on the project.
Apart from non-compliance with expenditure rules, reimbursement of ineligible costs is also hampered by the successful implementation of policy objectives and thus limits the added value of EU support (see example).
Example: Ineligible expenditure reduces EU added value The EU provides funding to ensure efficient and effective controls at EU external borders.
The Court examined a project in Spain involving the purchase of four helicopters, which were to be used 75 % for the surveillance and control of the external borders.
However, the Court found that only 25 % of the hours of operation of the helicopters were related to this purpose.
As a result, the EU should have paid only 25% and not the 75% actually taken over of the helicopter costs.
Detailed analysis of revenue and expenditure sectors 31 In the framework of the research expenditure control system, the Commission checks progress reports and cost statements on funded projects before payments are made.
The Court noted that the Commission did not always apply procedures in a uniform way, which could affect the efficiency of the programmes and increase the administrative burden on beneficiaries.
Our recommendations The Court recommends to the Commission that ο The Commission should provide current, coherent and clear guidance to beneficiaries and authorities in the Member States on the new research programmes for the period 2014-2020 (Horizon 2020) and other internal policies on eligibility rules and control rules. ο The Commission should make its control activities more risk-oriented by focusing audits on high-risk beneficiaries (e.g. less experienced institutions with EU support) and reducing the burden of controls on lower-risk beneficiaries.

More details of revenue and expenditure 32 Administrative expenditure and related expenditure 10.6 billion euros Subject of our audit The administrative expenditure and related expenditure comprise the expenditure of the institutions and other bodies of the EU.
These are the Commission, Parliament, the European External Action Service (EEAS), the European Council and the Council of the European Union, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor.
Expenditure on staff (contributions, allowances and pensions) represents 60 % of the expenditure, the remainder being for buildings, equipment, energy, communications and information technology.
The results of the Court's audits of the European Union agencies and other decentralised bodies will be addressed in specific annual reports, which will be published separately, including a summary.
No Estimated error rate: 1.0% (2012: 0.0 %) Investigated control systems: Effective The investigation of most control systems revealed no serious deficiencies.
However, the Court notes that the Commission and the EEAS have repeatedly made mistakes in payments of salaries and allowances, as well as weaknesses in the procurement procedures of the EU delegations (which are subject to the EEAS).
Our recommendations The Court recommends the following: ο The Commission and the EEAS should take further steps to ensure that parts of the staff files are up-to-date with regard to the payment of salaries and allowances. ο The EEAS should support and guide EU delegations on procurement procedures.
The full information on the Court's audit of administrative expenditure and related expenditure can be found in Chapter 9 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
A closer look at the revenue and expenditure areas of the European Development Fund (EDF) EUR 2.6 billion Subject matter of our audit 33 Under the EDF, the European Union grants funds for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
It will also promote sustainable development and the integration of the ACP States and OCTs into the global economy.
The EDFs are financed by the Member States and are subject to their own financial regulation and are managed by the European Commission outside the EU's general budget.
The environment in which external assistance financed by the EDF is implemented is highly risky, in particular because the activities are geographically dispersed and the partner countries do not have sufficient institutional and administrative capacity.
Our findings Reliability of EDF accounting: the annual accounts of the EDFs for 2013 are a material error in the asset and financial situation of the EDFs, the results of their operations, their cash flows and the changes in net assets as a whole?
No Control systems investigated: Does EDF commitments have a significant impact on errors?
Yes Estimated error rate: 3.4% (2012: 3.0%) Failure to comply with procurement rules was the cause of around half of the estimated error rate (see example).
Another significant source of error is the lack of supporting evidence.
Example: non-compliance with procurement rules by the beneficiary The Court examined a call for tenders for IT equipment for a business information centre, financed by a micro and small business support programme.
The test showed that the contract was not awarded to the tenderer with the lowest price offer, although the lowest price was the award criterion.
The error was not detected by the auditor who audited the programme in accordance with the relevant framework agreement with the Commission.
A closer look at revenue and expenditure sectors 34 The EDFs also provide budget support for payments directly into the budget of a developing country, provided that specific conditions are met.
The Court found errors in the transactions relating to budget support, where the fulfilment of the conditions had been misassessed and where the wrong exchange rate was applied for the conversion of the payment into the local currency.
The Commission's Directorate-General for EuropeAid manages not only the bulk of external aid expenditure from the EU budget, but also almost all expenditure under the European Development Fund (EDF).
The EuropeAid systems studied are assessed as conditionally effective.
However, in May 2013, EuropeAid adopted an action plan to address the main shortcomings identified.
Our recommendations The Court recommends to the Commission that: ο The Commission should recover interest on pre-financing. ο The Commission should review the quantification of the benefits of the controls carried out. ο The Commission should report on progress made in implementing the action plan to remedy shortcomings in the control system.
Full information on the Court's audit of the European Development Funds can be found in the Annual Report on Activities under the eighth, ninth and tenth European Development Funds (EDFs) for the financial year 2013.
Background information 35 The audit approach at a glance The Court's audit opinions in the context of the Statement of Assurance are based on objective evidence obtained, in particular through audit procedures carried out in accordance with international audit principles.
The EU budget is complex.
The Commission's Directorates-General each year arrange hundreds of thousands of entries based on data from many different sources (including the Member States).
The Court shall examine whether the accounting procedures function properly and whether the resulting accounting data are properly recorded and duly presented for the purposes of determining whether they are correct. ο Analytical audits of accounting data in order to determine whether they are consistent and plausible. ο Direct verification of a sample of accounting entries in order to determine whether the underlying transactions are actually present and correctly recorded. ο Audit of annual accounts in order to determine whether they represent the financial situation properly.
1 Payments recorded as expenditure are interim payments, final payments and advance payments.
The implementation of the EU budget provides millions of payments to beneficiaries within the EU and in the rest of the world.
Most of this expenditure is managed by the Member States.
In order to obtain the necessary evidence, the Court conducts direct audits of revenue and expenditure and assesses the systems by which payments are processed and controlled.
Further information on the audit process with regard to the preparation of the Statement of Assurance can be found in Annex 1.1 of the Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
Background information 37 The European Court of Auditors and its work The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the independent audit body of the European Union based in Luxembourg.
It employs around 900 staff from all EU nationalities, composed of auditors and staff in horizontal services.
Since its establishment in 1977, it has raised awareness of the importance of EU financial management and contributed to its improvement.
The Court's audit reports and opinions are an important link in the EU's accountability chain.
Our results are used to hold the bodies responsible for the EU's budget management accountable, in particular under the discharge procedure.
This is mainly the Commission, but it also affects the other EU institutions, bodies and agencies.
Member States also play an important role in shared management.
Our main tasks are: ο audits of the accounts and compliance audits, mainly with regard to the statement of assurance; ο economic audits on issues selected in such a way that we achieve the greatest possible impact with our work; ο opinions on legislation related to budgetary management and other important issues.
We strive to use our resources to strike a balance between our different areas of activity in order to achieve sound results and to effectively cover the various areas of the EU budget.
Background information 38 Our results We present the following results: ο Annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Funds; the annual reports mainly include the audit opinions in the context of the Statement of Assurance and the relevant results and will be published annually in November; ο Special annual reports on the audit opinions on the accounting of the various agencies and other bodies of the EU; 53 reports to be published in 2014; ο Special reports on selected audit topics, to be published throughout the year; these are mainly economic audits; about 25 reports to be published in 2014; ο Opinions to be used by the European Parliament and the Council in adopting EU legislation with significant implications for financial management; six opinions to be published in 2014; ο Landscape analyses on selected areas of EU policy in which major challenges and long-term trends will be analysed; ο The annual activity report, information and explanations on our activities in the year concerned.
With our work, we contribute to raising awareness about EU financial management and increasing transparency in this respect by providing a assurance of the state of financial management and by making recommendations for further improvements.
This is in the interests of the citizens of the European Union.

The European Court of Auditors is the independent external audit body of the EU - Guardians of EU finances In its annual reports on the EU budget and the European Development Funds, the Court gives an audit opinion (declaration of reliability) on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
This briefing provides an overview of the main findings and conclusions.
The full text of the reports is available on the Court's website and will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2 INTRODUCTION 1. The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (hereinafter referred to as "the Agency") based in Ljubljana was established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council1.
The main task of the Agency is to assist national regulatory authorities in carrying out the regulatory tasks carried out in the Member States at Union level and, where necessary, to coordinate the actions of those authorities.
Under the Regulation on the integrity and transparency of the wholesale energy market (REMIT Regulation)2, the Agency, together with the national regulatory authorities, will be given additional tasks in monitoring the wholesale European energy market3.
As regards the financial year 2011, the period from 8 March to 31 December 2011 was therefore examined.

OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 1.
The Annex to this Decision sets out, for information purposes, the responsibilities and activities of the Agency.
3 DECLARATION OF RELIABILITY 4. In accordance with Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court has examined the Agency's annual accounts4 consisting of the "annual accounts"5 and the "annual accounts"6 for the financial year ending 31 December 2011 and the legality and regularity of the operations underlying that account.
Management responsibility 5.In its function as authorising director, the budget in revenue and expenditure under the Agency's financial regulation is autonomous and within the limits of the appropriations authorised7.
The Director shall be responsible for the establishment8 of the organisational structure and of the internal management and control systems and procedures necessary to enable the establishment of a financial statement9 which shall be free of material misrepresentations, intended or unintended, 4 5 6 7 8 9 The annual accounts shall be accompanied by a report on the financial management and management of the financial year in question, including additional information on financial management and management.
The annual financial statements include the balance sheet and the financial result overview, the cash flow table, the table of changes in net assets, and a summary of the main accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
The relevant rules for the accounting and accounting of the agencies are laid down in Chapters 1 and 2 of Title VII of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002, as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 652/2008 (OJ L 347, 31.12.2008, p.
ADB001375EN04-12PP-CH058-12APCFIN-RAS-2011_ACER-TR.DOC 19.9.2012
6.The responsibility of the auditor 6.The responsibility of the Court of Justice to provide the European Parliament and the Council10 with a statement of assurance on the reliability of the Agency's accounts and the legality and regularity of its underlying transactions.
7. The Court has carried out an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing as well as the professional conduct requirements of IFAC and the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions of INTOSAI.
In accordance with these standards, the Court is required to plan and carry out the audit in such a way as to secure sufficient certainty as to whether the Agency's annual accounts are free of material misrepresentations and the underlying transactions are lawful and proper.
8.A statutory audit shall include the performance of auditacts in order to obtain audit evidence of the valuations and other information contained in the annual accounts, as well as the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The selection of audit acts is at the discretion of the examiner. This includes the assessment of the risks of material - intended or unintended - misrepresentations in the conclusion and of material - intended or unintended - violations of European Union legislation in the underlying transactions.
In assessing these risks, the auditor shall take into account the internal control system relevant to the preparation and proper overall presentation of the financial statements and the 5 monitoring and control systems set up to ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in order to plan audit actions that are appropriate in the circumstances.
An audit shall also include an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting policies applied and the representativeness of the estimated values in the accounting and an assessment of the overall presentation of the financial statements.
9.The Court's view that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to serve as the basis for the following audit opinions.
10.According to the Court's assessment, the Agency's annual accounts11 shall, as at 31 December 2011, reflect its financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year ending on that date, in accordance with its financial rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer12 in all essential respects.
11 12 The final annual accounts were drawn up on 19 June 2012 and were received by the Court on 2 July 2012.
The final annual accounts consolidated with the Commission's annual accounts shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 15 November of the following year.
The annual accounts are available at the following addresses: http://eca.europa.eu or http://ww.acer.europa.eu/.
The accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer are based on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) or, in the case of operations for which there are no IPSAS standards, on the International Accounting Standards (IAS) or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In addition, the payment rate was low in relation to commitments of 41% each for Titles II and III.
The high level of unused appropriations and transfers made and the low payment rate indicate shortcomings in budget planning and implementation and constitute a breach of the budgetary principle of annuality.
OTHER COMMENTS 14.The transparency of recruitment procedures needs to be improved.
For example, the vacancy notices did not specify the maximum number of candidates to be included in a reserve list, nor did they contain any appeals.
7 the written and oral exams and their respective weightings are not prepared prior to the examination of the applications.
15.In 2011, the Agency paid daily allowances of EUR 10 839 to seconded experts who were nationals of the country in which the Agency is based.
This payment is contrary to the rules adopted by the Agency's Management Board for the secondment of national experts, according to which only temporary staff who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are employed are entitled to daily allowances.
This report was adopted by Chamber IV, chaired by Mr Louis GALEA, Member of the Court of Auditors, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 5 September 2012.

ACER - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ACER - Agence de coopération des régulateurs de l'énergie ANSWERS TO THE AGENCY 13. During the first year of its operation, ACER had to hire a large part of its staff, which was connected with problems and led to job vacancies being filled late; this was clearly reflected in the use rate of the Agency's budget.
This also affected the estimated procurement needs and led to the focus of procurement procedures at the end of the year, thus requiring large carry-overs to meet the legal and budgetary commitments made.
Since most posts were filled at the beginning of 2012, ACER is now in a much better position to carry out the tasks entrusted to it and to carry out the related budget.
14. ACER takes note of the justification of the Court's observations and has already taken corrective action.
15. ACER takes note of the justification of the provisional finding and has already stopped the daily allowance payments to Slovenian ANS.

The Auditor's responsibility 5. The Court's duty to provide the European Parliament and the Council8 with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
According to these standards, the Court is required to plan and carry out the audit in such a way as to obtain sufficient certainty as to whether the ADB001936DE04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014
The selection of the examination acts is at the discretion of the examiner.
In assessing these risks, the auditor shall take into account all internal controls relevant to the establishment and proper overall presentation of the financial statements and the monitoring and control systems established to ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and shall plan audit actions that are appropriate in the circumstances.

6 The Commission's report on the implementation of the Community's financial rules in the field of the environment and the environment (COM(88) 346 final) is based on a proposal from the Commission of the European Communities for a directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the environment (COM(88) 446 final).
10.The following comments do not call into question the Court's judgments.
COMMENTS ON BUDGET MANAGEMENT 11.The Agency has carried over EUR 1.9 million or 56% of the total committed appropriations under Title II (Buildings of the Agency and associated costs), which are mainly related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
This is an operational, multiannual activity which would have been terminated under Title III of the budget.
12.In addition, the Agency has transferred EUR 3.1 million or 91% of the total committed under Title III, also in connection with the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
The exceptionally high transfer rate of Title III is primarily due to an increase in appropriations of around EUR 3 million by means of an amending budget approved on 31 October 2013.
OTHER COMMENTS 13.At the end of the year, the Agency had EUR 5.5 million in cash, including around 3 million from the late adopted ADB001936DE04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014 7 Amending budget (see paragraph 12).
Nevertheless, average cash balances during the year were significantly higher than those justified by operational needs.
CONTINUING THE REMARKS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS 14.Annex I gives an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations made in previous years. This report was adopted by Chamber IV, chaired by Mr Milan Martin CVIKL, Member of the Court of Auditors, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 8 July 2014.

1 CONTINUING THE COMMENTS FROM THE ANNUAL ANNEX I Year The Court's comment State of the corrective action (completed/in progress/outgoing/e.g.) 2011 The high level of unused appropriations and the carry-overs made as well as the low payment rate indicate shortcomings in budget planning and implementation and constitute a breach of the budgetary principle of annuality.
Completed 2011 Transparency of recruitment procedures needs to be improved.
In addition, the questions for the written and oral exams and their respective weighting were not worked out before the examination of the applications.
Completed 2012 In order to cover higher school fees, the Agency shall grant a special allowance in addition to the educational allowance provided for in the Staff Regulations to staff whose children attend primary or secondary schools1.
In 2012, the total special allowances amounted to around EUR 23 000.
They are not covered by the Staff Regulations and are therefore contrary to the rules.
Completed ADB001936EN04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014
1 2 year Court comment Situation of the corrective action (completed/in progress/outgoing/n.e.) 2012 The Agency has carried over to the following financial year commitments of EUR 1.7 million in Title II (buildings of the Agency and ancillary costs) of its budget (this corresponds to 81 % of the total committed appropriations under Title II).
These transfers are mainly linked to the ongoing implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
Since these implementing measures are part of the operational activities of the Agency, they would have been included in the budget under Title III.
Completed 2012 In 2012, the Agency carried out 20 transfers of some EUR 1 million within the budget, affecting 43 budget lines.
Completed 2012 At the end of the year, the Agency had EUR 4.2 million in cash, including the 2011 budget surplus of EUR 1.6 million, resulting from an excessive call-out in 2011, which was recovered by the Commission in January 2013.
In the course of 2012 The recruitment procedures examined showed weaknesses with regard to transparency and equal treatment of candidates: The questions for the oral and written examinations were not established before the examination of the applications.
The conditions for admission to the written and oral examinations and for inclusion in the list of suitable candidates were not sufficiently precise and insufficient measures were taken to ensure the anonymity of candidates participating in the written examinations.
Article 3 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations provides for double the basic allowance of EUR 252.81, i.e. EUR 505.62.

ACER - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ANSWER OF AGENCY 11. As the Court noted, this deficiency has already been corrected by the Agency in the case of subsequent commitment appropriations related to the implementation of REMIT entered in the operational budget lines under Title III.
12. As the auditors have already acknowledged, the high transfer rate was due to delays in the implementation of REMIT.
This delay was due to the fact that DG ENER only approved the transfer of the necessary additional funds in October 2013 and that the funds were received by the Agency at the beginning of November 2013.
However, the Agency has succeeded in successfully completing all procurement procedures planned in connection with the implementation of REMIT by December 2013 and the related expenditure will be incurred in 2014.
13. The balance of the accounts at the end of the year, due to a budgetary adjustment, included the EUR 3 million received late in the year; the remaining amount was used to cover all legal obligations, in particular with regard to REMIT, for which commitments were made towards the end of 2013.
The cash forecast tool introduced in 2014 will allow better cash management for the future. ACER - DE

EN 1.12.2016 Official Journal of the European Union C 449/19 COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 12. The Agency transferred EUR 1.36 million or 59 % of the appropriations committed under Title III (operational expenditure) to the following financial year (2014: EUR 1.57 million or 62 %).
These transfers were mainly related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation (1.1 million euros), a complex multi-annual operational activity in relation to the integrity and transparency of the energy wholesale market.
In addition, the Agency transferred EUR 0.79 million or 35% (2014: EUR 0.98 million or 41%) of the appropriations committed under Title II (administrative expenditure) to the following financial year. These transfers mainly concerned studies and services not yet provided in 2015.
CONTINUE OF COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 13. Annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
This report was adopted by Chamber IV, chaired by Mr Baudilio TOM such as MUGURUZA, Member of the Court of Auditors, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 13 September 2016.
Mr Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President
C 449/20 Official Journal of the European Union 1.12.2016 DE Court's comment The Agency transferred EUR 1.57 million and 62 % of the appropriations committed under Title III (operational expenditure) to the following financial year (2013: EUR 3.1 million and 91%).
These transfers were mainly related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation, a complex multi-annual operational activity on which the implementing regulation was only adopted on 17 December 2014 (1).
The Agency also transferred EUR 0.98 million and 41% (2013: EUR 1.9 million and 56% respectively) of the funds committed under Title II (administrative expenditure) to the following financial year.
In October 2013, the Agency received an additional EUR 3 million for the implementation of the REMIT Regulation by means of an amending budget, which it transferred to 2014.
However, the REMIT framework will only apply as of October 2015 in accordance with the implementing regulation.
Part of the funding was used in 2014 to prepare for the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
At the end of 2014, the Agency made two pre-financing payments of over 1.56 million euros for the provision of services in connection with the REMIT Regulation, which is to be provided in the years 2015-2017. In this way, an automatic repayment of unused funds to the Commission was avoided(2).
Although the Agency can thereby finance its future REMIT-related activities, this approach is in contradiction with the budgetary principle of annuality.
The agreement between the Agency and the Slovenian government is to establish a European school in Slovenia, but this has still not happened more than four years after the agreement was concluded.

According to Article 13 of the EU Financial Regulation, only the next financial year will be transferred.
EN 1.12.2016 Official Journal of the European Union C 449/21 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 13. The Agency is aware of the high amounts of funds transferred due to open commitments at the end of the year, mainly due to the long-term nature of the implementation of the REMIT project.
Given the continuing uncertainty about the annual budget allocation to the Agency, the principle of annuality is difficult to reconcile with the inevitable multi-annual nature of the REMIT project.

Gemein§ Articles 310 to 325 TFEU and the financial regulations of the agency the management is responsible for the establishment and overall presentation of the annual accounts on the basis of internationally recognized accounting grounds for the public sector as well as for the legality and regularity of the underlying decisions.
This responsibility includes the design, establishment and maintenance of internal control structures as necessary for the establishment and presentation of an annual financial statement that is free from essential intentional or unintended misrepresentations.
The management of the agency exercises the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the accounts.
10. The responsible persons responsible for monitoring are responsible for supervising the institution's accounting process.
EN 6.12.2017 Official Journal of the European Union C 417/27 Responsibilities of the judge for the auditing of the annual accounts and the underlying proposals 11. Our aims are to obtain sufficient certainty as to whether the annual accounts of the agency are free from material misrepresentations and whether the underlying proposals are correct and orderly, as well as to the European Parliament and the Council or other competent discharge authorities on the basis of our examination to submit an explanation about the reliability of the accounts as well as the legality and regularity of the underlying proposals.
False representations and understandings can be intended or unintended and will be considered essential if they can be expected individually or collectively to influence the economic decisions made by users on the basis of this annual accounts.
12. A review includes the execution of proceedings in order to obtain evidence for the values and other information contained in the annual accounts as well as for the legality and regularity of the underlying decisions. The selection of proceedings is at the discretion of the examiner. To this end, the assessment of the risks of essential or unintended misrepresentations in the annual accounts as well as of material or unintended misrepresentations in the underlying decisions, as well as of essential intentional or unintended misrepresentations, is carried out against the legal provisions of the European Union.
In assessing these risks, the expert takes into account all the internal controls relevant to the establishment and appropriate overall presentation of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, in order to plan practices that are appropriate among the relevant circumstances, but not with the aim of giving a judgment on the effectiveness of the internal control system.
An audit shall also include the assessment of the adequacy of the accounting policies applied, the representativeness of the underlying assets identified by the management in the accounting and the assessment of the overall presentation of the annual accounts.
13. With regard to revenue, we shall examine the subsidy received by the Agency from the Commission and assess its procedures for collecting fees and other revenue, if relevant.
14. With regard to expenditure, we examine the payment arrangements after the expenditures have been collected, recorded and accepted.
Advance payments are made after the reprimander has proven their proper use and the agency has accepted the proofs by billing the advance payment in the same year or later.
15. In drawing up this report and the declaration of competence, Article 208(4) of the EU Financial Regulation (6) took into account the work carried out by the independent external expert on the Agency's annual accounts.
16. The following remarks do not call into question the Court's judgment.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 17. In its May 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed the urgent need to clarify roles and responsibilities and to analyse the workload of the contracting authority in order to increase the efficiency of processes and procedures.
The IAS also concluded that planning and monitoring of procurement must be significantly improved.
The Agency and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY AFFAIRS 18. The Agency transferred EUR 4.9 million and 86 % of the appropriations committed under Title III (operational expenditure) to the following financial year (2015: EUR 1.4 million and 59 %).
As in previous years, these transfers were mainly related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation on the Integrity and Transparency of the Energy Wholesale Trade Market(7) and amounted to 4.7 million euros in 2016 (2015: 1.1 million euros).
For Title II (Administrative expenditure), the Agency transferred EUR 1 million or 38% of the committed appropriations to the following financial year (2015: EUR 0.8 million and 35% respectively).
19. The increase in appropriations is alarming and is contrary to the budgetary principle of annuality.
The higher transfer rate is directly linked to the conclusion and signing of procurement procedures and parts of contracts towards the end of the year, which leads to a shift of deliveries and/or payments to the following year.
In 2016, 98 out of a total of 299 sales were signed in November and December (5 976 122.47 euros and 40 % of the total value of the 2016 closed sales).
The Agency may adopt separate budgets in order to better accommodate the multi-annual nature of the activities as well as inevitable delays between contract signatures, deliveries and payments.

Year 2014 2015 ANNEX Follow-up of comments from previous years of correction acceptance (completed/in progress/outstanding/n.e.)
EN C 417/30 Official Journal of the European Union 6.12.2017 ANSWER OF THE AGENCY 18. The Agency has successfully implemented the measures, as agreed with the IAS.
Of the six recommendations, two very important and three important have already been completed.
The Agency plans to finalise the last recommendation by October 2017.
19. The Agency notes that the funds transferred are high due to the multi-annual investments in connection with the REMIT Regulation and are difficult to reconcile with the budgetary principle of annuality.
The high carry-overs result from the timing of the annual contract cycle, which was set up in 2013, when the Agency received significant additional budget for the REMIT project at the end of the year.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the commitment for the financial year 2016 was implemented at 100% under the REMIT chapter.
The Agency will analyse the implementation of separate budgetary resources for Title III.
20. The Agency considers that the introduction of separate funds for Title III better reflects the multi-annual nature of some of its activities, particularly in the area of REMIT, provided that the financial resources allocated to the Agency are stable and predictable.

1), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1946/93 (OJ L 298, 20.10.1993, p.
The Court examined the financial statements of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year ending 31 December 1995.
Pursuant to Article 18(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76,
15), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Management Board.
In accordance with Articles 65, 61 and 68 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93, the latter is also responsible for drawing up and presenting the financial statements in accordance with the financial rules.
The Court of Auditors is required to examine these financial statements in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The European Council of 29 October 1993 decided to transfer Cedefop's headquarters from Berlin to Thessaloniki.
In order to facilitate this move, certain changes have been made to the conditions of employment of staff, some of which were not in line with the regulations in force.
The exact circumstances are explained in paragraphs 46 - 66.
In addition, a number of other cases have been identified where payments were not fully in line with the current regulations.
5. On the basis of the Court's audit, it is reasonable to conclude that the financial statements for points on page 10 11 12 are reliable for the financial year ending 31 December 1995 in so far as they accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure for 1995 and the financial situation at the end of the year.
Apart from the important exception in the area of expenditure mentioned in the previous paragraph, the underlying transactions were, as a whole, lawful and proper.
General comments Background 6. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 as a European Community satellite body and is intended to promote vocational training at Community level.
Cedefop began its work in Berlin in 1976 and moved to Thessaloniki in 1995.
The aim of the Centre, as defined in that Regulation, is to'support the Commission to promote and develop vocational training and continuing training at Community level', to contribute 'to the implementation of a common vocational training policy' and, in particular, to promote the exchange of information and experience.
In the field of vocational training, the Centre's task is in particular to 'create documentation, contribute to the development and coordination of research, ensure the dissemination of appropriate documentation and information, promote and support initiatives which can lead to a coordinated solution (in particular in the alignment of training levels and mutual recognition of certificates) and set up a meeting place for the parties concerned'. 8. The Centre is managed by a board of 48 members (in 1995 costs of ECU 334 000 were incurred in this context).
The Board of Directors shall elect a Chairperson and three Vice-Chairmen from among its members for a period of one year.
At the time of the audit (May 1996), the Chairman of the Administrative Council was the Director-General of DG XXII — Education, Training and Youth.
The Director of the Centre shall be appointed by the Commission on the basis of a list of candidates submitted by the Management Board.
9. In accordance with the basic Regulation, the Director is responsible for the daily management of the Centre, while the Board of Directors bears overall responsibility.
The Management Board shall take decisions, adopt the work programme and the annual report, draw up the revenue and expenditure plan for the previous year and the estimate of revenue and expenditure for the coming year.
10. The Commission's role, as set out in the basic Regulation, is not only to represent the Commission's interests within the Management Board, but also to adopt the work programme, to examine the annual report and the revenue and expenditure plan, and to forward the estimates of revenue and expenditure to the Council and the European Parliament.
In accordance with Article 23 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 * of 30 June 1993, all commitments and payments made by the Centre prior to the actual payment must:
For the 1995 financial year, the Centre had a budget of ECU 16.50 million.
The commitments entered into resulted in payments of ECU 10.11 million and transfers to the 1996 financial year of ECU 4.67 million, with the remaining amount of ECU 1.72 million being cancelled.
From the appropriations carried over from the previous year, ECU 2.16 million was disbursed and ECU 0.29 million cancelled.
Annex 1 to this report gives an analysis of the use made of appropriations for the financial year and of the appropriations carried over from the 1994 financial year.
Annex 2 gives an overview of the budget accounts for the financial year 1995 and the balance sheet of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 1995.
Comments on implementation of the budget Separation of activities 15. Following the move to Thessaloniki, the Centre had not yet put in place adequate procedures to separate the activities of the authorising officer, the accounting officer and the imprest administrator until the date of the audit (May 1996).
For example, it was observed that the accounting officer was involved in the activities of the imprest administrator.
The proportion of payments made without the approval of the financial controller is still high (in 1995 it was 60% excluding salaries).
The strong use of the paying agency procedure is not in line with the spirit of the financial rules.
A more acceptable practice would be to handle only current expenditure and expenditure in a small amount, where the risk of irregularity is comparatively low, through the paying agency.
Transfers of appropriations within the budget 17. Transfers of appropriations between different budget lines amounted to ECU 922,000 in 1995, i.e. 5.6% of the initial budget compared with 10.9% in 1994.
No. C 81/4 EN........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
18. The Centre did not carry out any transfers of funds between different titles in 1995.
The Court's remark (2) was therefore taken into account last year.
Transfers and cancellations of appropriations 19. The practice of transferring large amounts of appropriations already observed in previous years (3) continued to increase in 1995.
In 1995, only 61% of the final available appropriations were disbursed compared with 73% in 1994.
The proportion of commitments carried over to 1996 was 28% (compared to 23% in 1994).
The proportion of appropriations lost was 10 %, compared with 5 % in 1994.
Table 1 shows by title the appropriations carried over from the original 1995 budget and their subsequent use.
The transfers in operational expenditure amounted to 53% of the initial appropriations compared with 40% in 1994.
Since 8% of operational expenditure was spent, this means that the Centre paid only 39% of its 1995 operational budget in 1995.
At the end of the first quarter of 1996, only 34% of the appropriations carried over from 1995 were paid out under Title 3.
The large number of transfers within the budget and of cancellations and the large amount of transfers to the next financial year suggest that the work programme has not been implemented as planned and that the principles of economic management have been jeopardised.
This fact and the lack of staff (see paragraphs 42 - 45) will have a serious impact on the implementation of the 1996 budget.
The first tranche of 2 300 000 ECU was disbursed on 6 February 1995, followed by further tranches of 2 400 000 ECU on 20 April 1995, of 2 500 000 ECU on 28 June 1995, of 2 800 000 ECU on 5 October 1995, of 5 875 000 ECU on 22 November 1995 and of 525 000 ECU on 1 December 1995.
As in previous years,4 this rate of payment is not in line with the Court's annual report for 1994.
(3) Annual reports of the Court on the financial years 1992, 1993 with Article 26 of the Financial Regulation for the Centre, according to which payments are to be made in the first half of each quarter and adapted to actual needs.
Expenditure 23. After a decision had been taken to move the Centre to Thessaloniki, a new Deputy Director was appointed in 1994, who at that time lived and worked in Thessaloniki.
Staff moved to Berlin and received an establishment allowance equal to twice the basic salary. Not once a year later, i.e. after the move of the centre to Thessaloniki, the same staff member again received an establishment allowance equal to twice the basic salary.
As the transfer of the Centre took place quickly, the stay of the operator concerned in Berlin was only of short duration (11 months); moreover, he spent part of this time in Thessaloniki, and he also received the full daily allowances (including weekends) ; the Court considers that these decisions are not in line with the principle of sound financial management and are contrary to the principles of Cedefop.
24. The contract of another deputy director, who had already moved from Berlin to Madrid in July 1995', was signed by the Board of Directors with effect from 31 January 1995.
The staff member received a payment of ECU 71 030.
The Court considers that this decision of the Board of Directors is not in line with the principles of economic governance.
25. Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 of 30 June 1993, allows the award of a contract on a voluntary basis, provided that the total amount of the contract does not exceed ECU 12 000.
I n at least 12 cases have been awarded over a higher amount than ECU 12 000 without complying with the procurement procedures described in Article 45 of the said Regulation.
26. Almost 40 % of commitments under the pilot studies and projects budget line for the 1995 budget (ECU 300 000) have been made in the last two months of 1995.
The budget heading 'Exchange of officials and experts' involved an amount of ECU 150 572 for the remuneration of an expert who started his work at Cedefop on 1 February 1.996 and for another expert whose contract was signed on 22 December 1995.
These commitments were made overburdened in order not to make the appropriations fall short.
27. The rent for Cedefop's temporary premises for January 1996 (22 750 ECU) has already been included in the 1995 budget.
As these expenditures relate to the 1996 financial year, they should also have been charged for the 1996 financial year and for 1994.
The Court urges the Centre to draw up an up-to-date inventory as soon as possible, as required by Article 52 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 of 30 June 1993.
29. The balance sheet shall show an outstanding amount of ECU 3 134 for an invoice issued in 1991 among outstanding receivables from the previous financial year.
The Court's comment made last year (5) was not taken into account, although the Centre had given an assurance in its reply.
The Court recommends that the Centre write off this amount until there is reason to believe that this amount will be recovered.
At the end of the year, the Centre had a remaining cash equivalent of ECU 5.9 million.
The Centre is therefore responsible for managing large amounts of cash, although it has little expertise in this area.
The Court reiterates its remark made last year (6) that this situation should be avoided by bringing the Centre closer into line with the Commission's actual cash needs on a quarterly basis. - At the same time, the Commission should ensure that the Centre receives a realistic liquidity forecast before making its payments.
The European Council of 29 October 1993 decided to transfer Cedefop's headquarters from Berlin to Thessaloniki in Greece (7).
32. The actual transfer to Thessaloniki took place in August 1995, and in September 1995 the Centre began its activities in Greece.
According to the Court's calculations, the 1995 budget accounts contain some ECU 3 300 000 for removal expenditure.
33. Since 1 September 1995, the Centre has been housed in a building of the Institute of Agriculture and Industry of Thessaloniki.
At the latest from 1 September 1999, the Greek State will provide the Centre with a permanent accommodation facility.
The Centre has signed four agreements—(i) Annual report of the Court for the 1994 financial year.
(6) Annual report of the Court for the financial year 1994.
(7) Council Decision 93/C 323/01 of 29 October 1993, OJ C 323 of 30.11.1993, p. 1.
The basic agreement between Cedefop and the Greek State was signed in Thessaloniki on 22 June 1995.
The three other agreements, including an agreement between the Greek State and the organisation responsible for the whole construction, form part of this basic agreement.
Provisional accommodation 34. An annual rent of 273,000 ECU is payable directly to the owner for the provisional building of the Centre.
35. In accordance with Article 1 of the Agreement between the Greek State and the Centre, the Greek State shall make available to Cedefop the temporary premises, including all associated installations, as from 1 September 1995.
The Greek authorities are responsible for electrical and electronic cable connections and telephone connections.
36. At the handover of the building, the Centre did not raise any written objections.
However, during the first four months of Thessaloniki (September to December 1995), the Centre had to invest ECU 120 000 to make the temporary premises of the building workable.
Among other things, electronic and electrical cable connections as well as telephone connections had to be installed.
37. These investments were fully borne by the Centre and the corresponding costs were included in the 1995 budget.
The agreements do not give a clear indication of who is to take over these investments.
The Greek State is obliged to provide the Centre with a permanent accommodation building by 1 September 1999 at the latest.
Cedefop will pay the Greek State a total amount of 6 879 750 ECU for the construction of the building, which will be paid in four equal instalments of 1 719 937 ECU each.
For the first three instalments, the payment dates were 1 September 1995, 1 September 1996 and 1 September 1997.
The final instalment shall be paid at the final handover of the building.
39. The Centre has not ensured that these payments are linked to the actual progress of the works.
The Centre will have paid ECU 5 159 811 more than two years before the building was handed over.
The Court recommends that the Centre should ensure that interest is used for the first tranche in favour of the Fund.
No. C 81/6 EN  the Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3. 97 41. The Centre should ensure that the Employee Accommodation Organization (O.E.K.) is responsible for the overall implementation of the work undertaken by Cedefop.
Staff: General comments 42. The 1995 establishment plan provides for 79 posts, including 24À,11LA,15B,26Cund3D. At the time of the audit (May 1996) 37 persons actually worked for Cedefop (14 A, 7 B, 14 C and 2 D), 11 had been taken over by other EU institutions, 14 had left the centre before moving to Thessaloniki and 17 had decided to stay in Berlin.
In 1995 and 1996, many new employees had to be recruited, and this development will continue in 1996.
43. The 17 persons remaining in Berlin are free to work for public and private institutions or other EU institutions, while continuing to receive their salary for up to a maximum of 18 months, depending on their seniority at Cedefop (each year is equivalent to one month's salary and the minimum service period must be 6 months).
At the end of this period, the parties concerned may either move to Thessaloniki or seek another solution.
This situation means that Cedefop cannot fill these 17 posts (May 1996) because they are blocked in the budget and cannot be filled, since those concerned may decide at a later stage to move to Thessaloniki.
44. It is unclear what should happen to those of this group of 17 people who do not wish to move to Thessaloniki after the specified duration of their stay in Berlin.
Article 20 of the Staff Regulations provides that 'the official must take up residence in or at such distance from that place that he is not disabled in the performance of his duties'.
Irrespective of this, three cases of staff not ready to move to Thessaloniki have already been brought to the EU Court of Justice.
This situation, in which 17 important posts foreseen in the budget are blocked by staff who are not currently working for Cedefop, had a significant impact on the Centre's work back in 1995 and will continue to do so in 1996 and 1997.
Staff: Amendment to Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 of 10 February 1975, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995, states: 'The staff of the Centre shall be subject to the regulations and regulations applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities.
The Centre shall exercise over its staff the powers delegated to the Appointing Authority.
The Management Board of the Centre shall, after consulting the Commission, lay down the relevant implementing rules."
Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 also repeals Council Regulation (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) No 1859/76 of 29 June 1976 laying down the conditions of employment for the staff of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training.
The amendment was necessary in order to 'consistently manage the staff of the various decentralised bodies (...) at Community level' (8).
While the staff of the Centre have been appointed officials, the staff of the other decentralised bodies are temporary staff.
47. The Court examined the changes to employment conditions and other agreements between the Board of Directors and staff, and noted a number of irregularities; the most serious irregularities from the Court's point of view are described in paragraphs 49-66.
48. The Management Board has not submitted these agreements to the Financial Controller for approval.
Nevertheless, all the appropriations resulting from these agreements were settled through the paying agency procedure and subsequently received the financial controller's endorsement.
In the context of the move to Thessaloese niki, the Centre has taken the following measures to adapt the situation of its staff: — a first step, on 1 March 1995, was the appointment of all members of staff as temporary staff (Article 2(b) of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities), in the same grade and grade as those employed as contract staff; — a second step, these staff were recruited as EU officials as of 1 April 1995, by means of an internal selection procedure, which had finally been "ared" on the basis of qualifications.
Infringement of the Staff Regulations relating to seniority classification in the initial appointment of Cedefop's former contract staff at a time of 50 years. At the initial appointment of Cedefop's contract staff to temporary staff on 1 March 1995, none of the staff should have been classified in a higher seniority than level 3 (or in step 4 in grade A 1 (8) Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 establishing Cedefop, fourth recital).
Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/7 to A 4, LA 3 and LA 4) (see Article 32 of the Staff Regulations, which are applicable to temporary staff in accordance with Article 15 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants).
51. Nevertheless, 33 of the 59 staff appointed as temporary staff were classified as higher than level 3.
The Centre published 15 linked job vacancies and announcements of internal competitions on 1 March 1995.
Under the Staff Regulations, the purpose of a selection procedure is to organise a competition between several candidates so that the vacancy can be filled with the best qualified candidate (Article 27(1) of the Staff Regulations).
A selection procedure is therefore by definition linked to a competitive situation and the risk of non-existence (10).
This has the effect that appointment decisions should be considered illegal following a selection procedure in which the abuse of discretion exists ( n ).
The Commission's Legal Service came to the same conclusion as was confirmed by its memo of 4 January 1995 (12).
57. Since the selection procedures in question have had a different objective than those laid down in the Staff Regulations, it is to be assumed that the selection procedures carried out by Cedefop have been subject to abuse of discretion, which is why they must be considered illegal.
Infringement of the Staff Regulations relating to the classification in grade when appointing Cedefop's former contract staff as officials 58. In accordance with Article 31 of the Staff Regulations, the staff of Cedefop should have been appointed as officials as from 1 April 1995 as follows: — officials of category A or of the Special Language Service (LA): in the initial grade of their category or their special career (i.e. A 7 or LA 7) (Article 31, paragraph 1); — officials of the other categories: in the entrance grades corresponding to the posts for which they were recruited (i.e. Β 1, Β 3 or Β 5; C 1, C 3 or C 5, D 1, D 3 or D 4) (Article 31, paragraph 2); — in the case of up to half of the appointments, except for certain staff members in the next higher grade group, this applies to six posts to be filled within each grade group (Article 31, paragraph 2 b).
59. Contrary to the provisions of the Staff Regulations, 32 out of 43 staff were appointed in a higher grade than the initial grade of their career (13).
10. Judgment of 29 September 1976 in Case 105/75 GI UFFRI DA v RAT, ECR p. 1395. (n) Judgment of GI UFFRI DA, see above.
(12)A selection procedure involves, by definition, the risk of non-existence and there are obvious legal reasons why this risk margin should remain.
(13)Of 17 staff members appointed in category A, 13 were appointed in a higher grade than A7 (the Staff Regulations provide for a limitation to six appointments); all five staff members were appointed in a higher grade than LA7 (the Staff Regulations do not provide for such a possibility); of 18 staff members in category C, 12 were appointed in a higher grade than the initial grade of their careers (the Staff Regulations provide for a limitation to six appointments); two out of three staff members in category D were appointed in a higher grade than in the initial grade of their careers (the Staff Regulations do not provide for such possibility).
No C 81/8 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 13.3.97 Failure to comply with probationary obligations 60. Before a member of staff can be appointed as a permanent official, he must successfully complete a probationary period (Article 34 of the Staff Regulations) and, following the probationary period, an objective retrospective evaluation of the official must therefore be carried out on a probationary basis.
In accordance with Article 38 of the Staff Regulations, only officials who have successfully completed the probationary period can be transferred to other institutions, i.e. officials who have already completed the probationary period.
65. This means that a system has been established whereby up to 50% of the remuneration of staff is transferred in a currency to which a higher correction coefficient applies (namely the correction coefficient of 111.4 % applicable to Germany) is to be regarded as Thessaloniki (a correction coefficient of 80.2% applies to Greece ).
Inequality in treatment with other officials through the introduction of special mobility provisions 66. The Commission committed itself to introducing specific provisions on mobility to the Centre.
These provisions are contrary to the principle of equal treatment of all officials.
Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995 clearly provides that the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants shall apply to the staff of the Centre.
This means that all the provisions contained therein shall apply to the staff of the Centre, including the subparagraph (c) of Article 29(1) which concerns the taking over of officials by other institutions.
There is therefore no justification for special treatment in relation to mobility. Summary, 67. The Court's audit has shown that the Centre's work programme has not been carried out as planned due to substantial staff shortages.
This led to large carry-overs and cancellations.
The audit also showed that no functioning administrative and accounting procedures have yet been set up.
68.Two Deputy Directors received remuneration corresponding to the basic salary for four months; these payments and a payment of ECU 71 030 to one of the Deputy Directors were not in line with sound financial management and the interests of the Centre.
69. At the time of the Court's examination, there were 79 approved posts, but only 37 persons were actually employed at the Centre.
17 staff had been appointed as EU officials,' although they did not wish to move to Thessaloniki, nor had they been taken over by any other Community institution.
Conclusion 71. It is understandable that efforts were made to keep staff in the institutions of the EU and to reduce the complex problems associated with the move to Thessaloniki.
The problem, however, is that the regulatory framework "within which the move had to be carried out was not compatible with the proper treatment of senior staff, even after changes to the employment arrangements, and did not allow for the smooth transfer of Cedefop without undermining its activities.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 21 November 1996.

The Management Board will follow the structure of the Court of Auditors' observations and conclusions.
3. The Management Board has the right to expect that all institutions and decentralised bodies will be treated in the same way and on the basis of the same technical standards and procedures that ensure equal treatment.
The Management Board considers that the uniform presentation of the problems fails to mention essential facts which could be summarised as follows: — The decision of the European Council of 29 October 1993 was taken without prior assessment of the effects of such a transfer.
At his first meeting with the staff, he expressed his firm determination to carry out the move to 1 September 1995, a timetable which CEDEFOP maintained despite the problems encountered by the transfer of the Centre. — The Chairman of the Board of Directors sent a letter to the Commissioners responsible, Mr van Miert and Mr Ruberti.
On 18 November 1994, the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Management Board of CEDEFOP were received by the members of the Commission.
The Chairman called on the Commission to draw up social accompanying measures, in particular for those staff who were unable to leave Berlin.
In the light of the regulations in force, the Commissioners stated that they were prepared to examine the specific problems of some staff in a positive and pragmatic spirit.
They also expected this from the other institutions of the Community (European Parliament, Council, etc.) — At its meeting on 8 and 9 December 1994, the Governing Council was unable to decide on the date of the transfer, since it did not appear acceptable for workers who could not move to Thessaloniki without simply dismissing a modern social plan.
At the same meeting the Management Board instructed the Director to prepare a Council Decision (adopted at an extraordinary meeting on 27 January 1995) which provided for a socially acceptable transfer of the Centre to 1 September. '— In the second half of December 1994, the Council began to examine the Commission's proposal to amend Article 13 of the Regulation applicable to CEDEFOP, which provided that the staff of the Centre were subject to the regulations and regulations applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities.
The Director adopted this amendment on the basis of the framework agreement on social support for the transfer of CEDEFOP to Thessaloniki.
On 23 January 1995, the framework agreement with the staff was signed.
The preparations were carried out in close cooperation with the European Commission, which proved to be very helpful throughout the transition period (1994-96). — The Management Board decided to accept the framework agreement and to move the Centre to Thessaloniki on 1 September 1995.
Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/13
Under the framework agreement, staff who could not leave Berlin decided to make themselves available to other EU institutions or public/privat organisations and to receive a salary from the Centre for at least six months, with a monthly salary paid for each year of service begun.
The principle of paying a monthly salary for each year of service is largely in line with the social plans and usual procedures in Germany and neighbouring countries. — Early retirement was considered in 1995 for 17 staff (aged over 55 years with 10 years of service and over 50 years with 15 years of service).
These measures were not part of the framework agreement and were finally not proposed by the Commission, following the decisions of the Council of Ministers of 17 November 1995 to accept the'release' of officials in connection with the accession of new Member States only to officials of the European Parliament.
The Management Board will respond in more detail in its opinions on points 46-66.
In general, it should be stressed that the political aspects must be taken seriously and that a subsequent criticism must be avoided.
The introduction of a complete Community body within the restrictive framework of a large number of different regulations and given a considerable amount of social and individual problems is indeed unique in the history of the Community.
5. The Board of Directors will return below in this reply to the exception mentioned in the last sentence.
The costs of the meetings of the Board of Directors in 1995 are due to the fact that two additional meetings (in January and June) had to be held in connection with the transfer.
In addition, the December 1995 meeting caused higher costs as a result of the official start of activity in Greece.
Only two meetings are planned for 1996.
13. The Management Board regrets that the Court did not respond to the European Parliament's decision to postpone discharge for the 1994 budget.
This raises serious questions, since — the discharge for 1994 in connection with the Court of Auditors' report for 1994 and the Council's recommendation on granting discharge should be seen and be in line with the usual rules and procedures; — the European Parliament's assessment of the 1995 financial year without the Court of Auditors' report for 1995 on which the Management Board could have given its opinion leads to the mix of very different situations; — the Centre was transferred to Greece in 1995.
The transfer was carried out smoothly and under acceptable conditions.
This transfer requires a transitional period, which can only be completed in 1997, as a result of the interruptions to which staff members have been exposed.
15. In this respect, there is a marked improvement.
In the early phase in Thessaloniki, staff helped each other to carry out the work.
16. As has been pointed out last year, the increased use of the paying agency procedure was made at the request of the financial controller, who justified this by the cost-benefit ratio.The previous system caused high rapid delivery costs and led to delays.
Similarly, the financial controller had to act more frequently.
The use of the paying agency procedure for all expenditure that could require provisional commitments limited administrative costs and avoided delays.
The situation is even more difficult due to the payment arrangements in Greece (most payments are made in cash or by cheque).
Invoices indicating bank links are rare; contractors collect their claims themselves.
The geographical distance to the financial controller and the lack of reliability of the mail delivery must also be taken into account.
In addition, DHL express deliveries may only be made once a week for cost reasons (3 000 Bfrs per shipment).
An amendment to the decision to set up the paying agency procedure will shortly be submitted to the Management Board in order to take better account of the Court of Auditors' wishes.
17. The transfers over the last two months are explained by the need to make optimum use of the budget (of which ECU 2 000 000 were deferred and were only released shortly before the transfer of the Centre to Thessaloniki) and by the decision of the Management Board (7/8.12.1995) to hire national experts seconded to the Commission (also to promote the Centre's work).
The Management Board was aware that 1995 and 1996 would be years of transition and renewal.
A certain reduction in productivity is inevitable in this international transfer, which the Board of Directors believes has been carried out in an acceptable and smooth manner.
The Centre is still facing problems caused by the transition phase.
20. Since the centre was relocated with a greatly reduced number of employees, the work of the administration and all other services slowed down.
Therefore, a non-automatic transfer of appropriations was requested and approved.
The Administrative Board notes that the Commission is making every effort to comply with the rules laid down in Article 26 of the Financial Regulation for the Centre and to pay the grant according to actual needs during the first two weeks of the quarter.
This was improved in 1995 compared to 1994.
However, due to the long internal procedures (in which the instructing authority, the financial controller and the accounting officer are involved) and the length of the bank's credit transfer procedure, a total delay in the processing period (on average 12 days in 1995) cannot be completely avoided.
Nevertheless, three payments would have been made in 1995 almost in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, since they arrived at the Centre less than four days after the end of the first two weeks of the quarter.
If the processing period for all payments (between 9 and 22 days) had been in line with the average period of 12 days, all payments would have been made in accordance with Article 26 of the Financial Regulation.
The first payment was not in line with the rules, but this payment must be preceded by the commitment of appropriations, which requires a certain amount of time.
23. The Deputy Director moved from Thessaloniki to Berlin because there was uncertainty about the actual date of the transfer of the Centre.
At the time of the appointment (1 October 1994) no decision had yet been taken on the date of the move (which could have been postponed even further).
It was to be hoped that his stay would be short, but his final duration was still unknown at that time.
For the usual family reasons, he moved to Berlin under the conditions of his status.
Daily allowances for missions were granted in accordance with the same procedure as for other servants.
With regard to the second set-up aid, the Deputy Director paid this sum back to the Centre after the audit, although he would have had full entitlement.
24. At its meeting in June 1995, the Management Board announced its contract on 31 December 1995 and instructed the Director to implement this Decision and to arrange for payments in accordance with the Staff Regulations.
The Management Board was pleased that the Deputy Director was prepared to participate in the implementation of the 1995 work programme and to support the Centre at its new start in Thessaloniki.
The compensation (the payment of one third of the basic salary from the date on which his duties expired until the expiry of his contract) was in accordance with his contract and Article 47 of the BBSB.
25. In view of the difficulties of the initial phase and the large number of new contracts, the Centre was not able to carry out the usual tendering procedures in every case.
In the case of longer-term contracts, tendering procedures are currently being carried out or planned for 1996.
In addition, in order to ensure balanced budgetary management during the year, the Management Board will prefer the adoption of the work programme so that the services can have the time to tender, make commitments and conclude contracts in the first months of the financial year.
The 40% of commitments under the pilot studies and projects budget line (ECU 300 000) were made in the last few months of the year, as a result of the late release of the appropriations in the 1995 budget by the budgetary authority and the transfer of the Centre to Thessaloniki.
The Centre had to act logically and consistently, leaving it with no other choice, since it was first obliged to fulfil its financial obligations under Titles I and II and was only able to make further commitments under Title III after the appropriations set aside had been released.
The possibility of seconding national experts was granted by the Management Board at its meeting in December 1995 and could only be financed by the resources deferred.
The Director had to act quickly and within a short period of time to prevent funds (which became available very late) from falling.
The application of the (Austrian) expert (officially supported by the government) was made early in 1995.
27. The reason for recording the rent for January 1996 in the 1995 financial statements was purely practical.
According to the contract, the rent must be paid in advance in two instalments on 1 January and 1 July.
Since the first payment was only made in October 1995 and it would have been difficult to pay again immediately on 1 January 1996, the first payment was made for a period of five months, including January 1996.
28. The inventory is being updated.
29. This will be complied with.
The Centre shall ensure that it submits to the Commission a realistic statement on the cash flow.
The last payment in the year should be the largest, since it must also be used to cover the first months of the following year in which larger payments are normally to be made.
31. See comments on point 4. 32. The management of the Centre shall assess the costs of the transfer and assess developments in order to gain a comprehensive picture of the costs and benefits of the transfer to Greece.
Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 81/15 36.-37.
Since it was expected that the Centre would resume its work immediately after the move, some additional investments and changes were needed.
As has been stated, the agreements do not provide a clear statement of this, because the centre needed more power connections and stronger computer cables than the existing ones.
Other investments concerned additional security requirements and communication facilities, such as Europe by Satellite, in order to receive broadcasts directly through the institutions.
However, the Centre has put questions relating to the provisional building on the agenda of the Steering Committee dealing with the new and (if necessary) the provisional building.
The Board is aware that the content of the agreement on the new building gave the Greek Government a great responsibility, which is currently fulfilling the agreement.
Two points of particular concern are: — securing the provision of a high quality building at a reasonable price; — securing the timely completion of the building (if possible before 1 September 1998).
The fact that large payments were made in advance (half of the building has already been paid, although construction has not yet started) may also have a positive effect, as the actual construction work (after selecting the construction plan and the construction firm in October/November 1996) could progress rapidly due to the immediate availability of the necessary financial resources.
In general, the Board of Directors fully understood the Court's concerns, which were shared by Members of the European Parliament, Mr Kellet-Bowmann and Mr Tappin, who visited the Centre on 1 and 2 May and 14 and 15 May respectively.
The Management Board is prepared to act on this issue in accordance with the Commission's recommendations.
The results of the various social support measures were very complex, but all those on the CEDEFOP payroll who were not made available to other organisations or who were seconded in Berlin were working for CEDEFOP and its work programme.
43. The Management Board has taken a decision on the social accompanying measures relating to the transfer (Framework Agreement) in order to take "appropriate measures as soon as possible" (see the declarations in the minutes of the Council).
The evaluation of the measures must therefore take into account their political background.
The Centre is located in Thessaloniki and the Management Board and the Director decide on the organisation of the work.
Certainly, some posts are blocked as long as the social accompanying measures are effective.
However, at the end of 1996, almost all the measures will expire, and then CEDEFOP will be able to operate with full capacity on the basis of medium-term priorities (adopted by the administration in November 1996) and the 1997 work programme, which will also be based on these priorities.
CEDEFOP will therefore move forward with a revitalised and new approach from 1997.
44. Persons who, for social or personal reasons, cannot leave Berlin when the fixed duration of their stay in Berlin ends have three alternatives.
In this regard, the President of the Court of First Instance declared three decisions rejecting the requests for transitional proceedings.
Such persons must move, withdraw from the service of the Centre or find solutions in accordance with the Staff Regulations.
45. The impact in 1996 is, of course, serious, but will be minimal after the first months of 1997.
The transfer had its consequences and costs.
However, when compared with a similar transfer at national level, such as that of the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches sur les Qualifications (CEREQ) from Paris to Marseille (where only 21 of the 120 employees moved with the Centre), CEDEFOP did not have an overly negative effect given an international transfer over a distance of almost 2 000 km.
Precautionary cost estimates indicate that cost neutrality will be achieved in 2000 and that work will be even more cost-effective thereafter (mainly due to lower labour costs in Greece). 46.-66.
(c) Following the decision of the Management Board of 27 January 1995, on 6 February 1995 (Regulation (EC) No 251/95), the Council amended Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 so that 'the staff of the Centre are subject to the rules and regulations applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities'.
In spite of the lack of transitional provisions, as in the case of the adoption of Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 269/68 (see Article 102 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities)
(d) Since the Community legislation did not provide for transitional measures, the Management Board had no choice but to act on its own responsibility in order to safeguard the rights and interests of CEDEFOP staff. (e) It should not be forgotten that Regulation (EC) No 251/95, which moved the seat of CEDEFOP from Berlin to Thessaloniki, meant a sudden change in the place of service listed in the employment contracts: Berlin had been the only seat of CEDEFOP since 20 years, and at no point since 10 February 1975 there was any slightest indication that this seat could be transferred, let alone to another, distant Member State.
(f) In view of these circumstances, the Management Board was obliged to: — provide staff with a high degree of security with regard to their place of work (appointment as life-long officials); — maintain their category, grade and step; and — assist staff wishing to find another job. (g) The Management Board would also like to point out that posts approved by the budgetary authority were permanent posts.
(h) In addition, the wording of Regulation (EC) No 251/95 ('the staff of the Centre shall be subject to the regulations and arrangements applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities') clearly provides for the employment of officials.
Since the positions filled by the staff are of a permanent nature, the decision on the status of officials was appropriate and justified rather than on temporary contracts.
The Board of Directors would also like to comment on the individual points raised by the Court: 46. (last sentence) The Board of Directors had the choice to appoint its staff either as life-long officials or to offer them two-year contracts (see opinion (g) above).
It was considered unacceptable to require staff to move from Berlin to Thessaloniki on the basis of a two-year contract.
Although it is true that the Board of Directors has not officially submitted the agreements to the Financial Controller for approval, the latter has nevertheless been informed of the decisions taken.
At the time of signature of the agreement, the outstanding individual decisions of staff members did not yet determine the exact financial impact of the agreement.
It provided a framework that provided the basis for individual decisions and received the full approval of the financial controller during his visit to Berlin.
50-51.
In view of the argument referred to above (e), the decision taken (see remark, second indent) was the only possible one.
The report also conformed to the Commission's clear statement (see last sentence of the declaration for the Council's minutes in the Annex) that 'there must be no deterioration in the conditions of employment of CEDEFOP's staff'.
The considerations of the Commission's legal service, which are quoted only in part in paragraph 56, leave sufficient room for such a decision.
The Management Board reiterates that Article 29 of the Staff Regulations entitles the appointing authority to conduct internal competitions for the purpose of filling vacant posts in an institution (point lb).
The competitions were conducted in full compliance with Annex III to the Staff Regulations.
The Management Board had the aim and the duty to ensure that as many CEDEFOP staff as possible agreed to move to Thessaloniki.
It should not be forgotten that Regulation (EC) No 251/95 amended the provisions applicable to staff with effect from 1 March 1995 and that the move to Thessaloniki took place in August of that year.
The Management Board's approach was based on the following considerations: — it was unthinkable to require the staff to move to Thessaloniki on the basis of a two-year contract (recital (g) and (46) above); — there was not enough time to carry out a general selection procedure before moving to Thessaloniki, and even here it would not have been realistic to expect the staff to move without a secure commitment to employment.
13. 3. 97 I EN  the Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 81/17 56.-59./ The Administrative Board has already explained (see above, remark (e)) that the move to Thessaloniki meant a sudden change in the place of employment, which inevitably caused social problems and for a certain period affected productivity.
To ask the staff to move after a low grade or step has been allocated would have aggravated their situation even further.
The Commission's Legal Service note, mentioned in paragraph 56, provides sufficient arguments under point (d) to justify the position adopted by the Centre. 60.-61.
All officials who applied for appointment as life-long officials completed the probationary period laid down in Article 34 of the Staff Regulations.
62. According to note (f), 3rd indent, above, the Management Board considered it its duty to assist staff in an acceptable manner.
This view was also taken by the Commission's Legal Service.
65. The rules governing the transfer arrangements of part of the remuneration allow for the possibility of increasing this percentage from 35 % to 50 % in individual cases where there are justified reasons in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulation.
The framework agreement, in individual cases and in the case of certain liabilities provided for in the Staff Regulations which were received before 29 October 1993 (the date on which the European Council decided to transfer the Centre), enabled the transfer of a higher percentage (> 35 %' according to the Staff Regulations but < 50 %).
The application of these rules is quite different in the case of CEDEFOP and concerns only a limited number of persons with high liabilities in Berlin.
66. The Management Board would like to thank the Commission for the assistance it has provided in a number of cases in the search for alternative employment opportunities for staff who were unable to move to Thessaloniki and for any other assistance it has provided to the Centre almost daily during the move.
68. See comments of the Management Board on paragraphs 23 and 24. 69.-70.
See in particular the general comments under points 46-66.
71. The Administrative Board regrets that the legislator has not introduced any transitional legal provisions in Regulation (EC) No 251/95 in order to resolve the difficult staffing problems caused by the move to Thessaloniki.
In view of the lack of appropriate instruments, the Management Board was all the more obliged to support CEDEFOP's staff to the fullest possible extent.
The Board of Directors believes that, in the present and truly unprecedented circumstances, it has acted in the only acceptable manner.
In the end, it was obvious that he had to make such an effort (as the Court acknowledges) since his duty as an employer is to carry out the international work of an entire institution in a socially acceptable manner.
The Board of Directors, the Director and the staff acted in this positive spirit, possibly taking some risks, but not having exercised any abuse of power, nor having acted unlawfully.

This report shall be sent to the Council and to the European Parliament in accordance with Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 (OJ No L 343, 30.12.1975, p.
The Court examined the financial statements of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year ending 31 December 1995.
In accordance with Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 (OJ L 343, 31.12.1993, p.
16) the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Management Board.

The Court of Auditors is required to examine these financial statements in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The Court has carried out its audit in accordance with generally accepted audit standards insofar as they apply to the Community context. Accordingly, it has carried out controls on the accounts and applied other auditing procedures which it deemed necessary in this context. 4. The Court considers that the financial statements for the accounts on 3 1.
The aim is "to contribute to the design and creation of better living and working conditions through action to promote and disseminate knowledge capable of supporting this development".
The Dublin Foundation began its activities in 1976.
The Court of Auditors examined the annual accounts and the financial management for 1995 of the Dublin Foundation in accordance with the relevant regulations (2).
Financial data 7. For the 1995 financial year, the Foundation had an appropriation of ECU 12.5 million.
The commitments entered into resulted in payments of ECU 9.3 million and transfers to the 1996 financial year of ECU 3 million, with the remainder of ECU 0.2 million cancelled.
Of the appropriations carried over from the previous year, 1.9 million ECU was disbursed and 0.2 million ECU annulled.
Annex 3 to this report contains an analysis by title of the use of appropriations for the financial year and of the appropriations carried over from 1994.
Follow-up to previous observations Separation of duties 8. The Court reiterates its earlier comments that the tasks of the authorising officer and the accounting officer are not sufficiently separate.
This is contrary to Article 15 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76, which states that the principle of ‘separation of powers of authorisation and accounting' applies and that ‘the activities of the authorising officer, the financial controller and the accounting officer [...] are incompatible'.
Paying agency 9. A large part (1995: 5 9% without salaries) of payments will continue to be made without prior approval by a financial controller.
The extent to which the paying agency is used is not within the meaning of the financial rules.
It would be more acceptable if only (2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 on the establishment of the Foundation (OJ No L 347, 30.12.1975, p.

Transfers from title to title 10. The Foundation continued to carry out transfers from title to title in 1995 (see paragraph 16).
This is in breach of Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of the 1 494 000 ECU (11.9% of the appropriations entered in the budget), whereas in 1994 they were ECU 756000 (6.5%).
16. By transfers of ECU 500 000 from Title 1 (Personnel) to Title 3 (operational expenditure), the Foundation was able to transfer commitments to the following financial year, which should otherwise have been cancelled in accordance with Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76.
As stated in paragraph 10 above, the Court considers that such transfers from title to title are contrary to the financial rules.
Transfers and cancellations of appropriations 17. As can be seen from Annex 3, the overall payment rate is 75 %, while the payment rate for Title 3 ‘Operational expenditure' is only 54 %.
Table 1 shows by title the transfers from the 1995 budget and their subsequent use in 1996.
The transfers under Title 3 amounted to 45 % of the original appropriations.
By the end of March 1996, only 20% of the transfers had been used.
Revenue 18. The EU grant to the Foundation amounted to ECU 12.5 million in 1995.
The amounts actually requested and received amounted to ECU 2.5 million as at 26 April 1995, ECU 2 million as at 14 June 1995, ECU 4.3 million as at 12 October 1995 and ECU 1.3 million as at 31 December 1995.
The difference of ECU 2.4 million was in line with the unnecessarily available cash resources, which were not requested from the Commission in accordance with the Court's recommendation of the previous year.
As in previous years, this type of financing is not compatible with Article 26 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93, which stipulates that the grant is to be paid in the first half of each quarter.
Expenditure 19. Under Article 63 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 of 30 June 1993 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of 1 June 1976, contracts worth more than 12 000 ECU must be awarded following a tendering procedure.
The following exceptions were found: — a contract worth ECU 533 072 for the implementation of a Europe-wide survey on working conditions was awarded free of charge. — In a sample of 26 contracts selected for examination, six contracts were awarded on the basis of Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of 1 June 1976, Council as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93.
In order to avoid the tendering procedure, Article 46 was used in three cases (supply of computers in one case and study contracts in the other).
20. In two cases it was established that expenditure had already been invoiced before the commitment was made.
In one case, accounts for November and December 1994 were taken into account for the commitment made in 1995, although the framework agreement between the Foundation and the contractor only began on 1 January 1995.
21. In a sample of 10 study contracts drawn up for the examination, the final reports were received for five contracts only months after the deadline laid down in the contract.
The Court held that, in the following cases, documents had been amended with the help of correction fluid: — the date of an invoice faxed to the Financial Controller of DM 45 365 (23 817 ECU) was overwritten with correction fluid and changed by hand from 17 January 1995 to 17 December 1994.
The financial controller gave his endorsement on the basis of this fax, and the change in the date'resulted in the expenditure accounting for the 1994 transfers and not for the 1995 appropriations. — The amount in a recovery order was overwritten with correction fluid and changed by hand from ECU 1 680.16 to ECU 4 741.97.
It is not clear what the financial controller's endorsement refers to.
27. The examination of a sample of payments identified problems in order management and inappropriate changes to important documents, see paragraphs 19-22.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 7 November 1996.

Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/25 ANSWER 8. The Foundation has introduced a series of measures to separate the duties of authorising officer and accounting officer.
The Court of Auditors has taken note of these initiatives in previous reports.
The only problem that remains in practice is the procedure whereby the authorising officer records expenditure in the existing integrated accounting system.
This problem will be solved once the Foundation has acquired a new accounting system.
Following the consultations in 1995, the Foundation, together with other EU agencies, took part in a joint tendering procedure for the acquisition of an appropriate accounting system.
The result was, however, that none of the candidates met the requirements of the institutions 100%.
After close contact with the Commission's services, it is expected that the Foundation will acquire an appropriate accounting system from the Commission in the course of 1997 after work on an appropriate system that meets the technical and legal requirements of the agencies has been completed recently.
The Foundation has established links with the Commission's services with regard to solutions to the identified problem. 9.
The Foundation has now been informed that this issue will be discussed between the Commission and the European Parliament in the context of the ongoing dialogue on the financial regulation of the agencies.
10. Following the Court of Auditors' last report, the Foundation asked the Commission services to clarify the Foundation's Financial Regulation as regards the transfers in question.
The Foundation is now informed by the Directorate-General of DG XIX that the transfers have been carried out in accordance with the Foundation's Financial Regulation (see also paragraph 16).
11. All missions to the Foundation were documented and approved by the authorising officer after he had made sure that they were in conformity with the Foundation's work programme or administrative requirements.
The Foundation will review its procedures for recording and finding the necessary documentation on missions.
The Regulation establishing the Foundation requires that the European institutions be consulted and that the social partners be involved in their work.
Although in recent years there has been a deepening of the exchange of FOUNDATION with the relevant EU bodies in Brussels, the number of missions to Brussels has not increased.
No missions are made when other means of communication can be used.
As far as possible, telephone, Internet, e-mail and other electronic tools are used. In November 1995 a videoconferencing pilot project was also launched.
Similarly, experiments with com-puter conferences have been carried out.
14. On the basis of a proposal submitted by the Irish authorities, lawyers are currently preparing a revised lease.
16. As stated in paragraph 10 above, the Foundation has been informed by the Commission that the transfers in question are in full compliance with the Financial Regulation, which has enabled the Foundation to make the most efficient use of the funds made available to it by the decisions of the budgetary authorities.
However, the Foundation appreciates the position of the Court of Auditors and Parliament and endeavours to carry out such transfers only in urgent cases.
These contracts essentially concerned studies with implementation periods of 12 months or more.
The Foundation will remind the Commission's services once again that the grant payments must be made by the 15th of each quarter.
19. In the Treaty establishing a European inquiry into working conditions, the file in question shows that the contract had been concluded between the European Commission and INRA (Europe) under the framework contract for the 'Eurobaromètre-Stan-dard' drawn up on the basis of an open tendering procedure.
The award of contracts was entirely in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 46 of the Financial Regulation of the Foundation and the criteria to be observed in this regard. These were followed and Article 46(d) was applied to the supply of computers.
Only one supplier had the required software as well as the special multi-spractious tastatures and provided local support: the other two contracts refer to research proposals.
At its meeting on 25 March 1994, the Foundation's Board of Directors approved the introduction of new procedures, which should be fully operational during 1995, for contracts based on calls for expressions of interest published in the Official Journal and for tenders.
The two contracts were concluded during the transitional period laid down by the Management Board.
20. The Foundation operates a decentralised ordering system.
The two invoices were part of a number of orders placed by an operational entity whose total orders exceeded the committed appropriations.
Appropriate measures will be taken to prevent this happening again.
The provision of a new calculation system should ensure the automatic implementation of the necessary controls.
21. Monitoring of the implementation of the study contracts shall be carried out on a monthly basis on the programme management basis.
22. The appointment was placed for the departments concerned on 11 October 1994.
The change in the date on the invoice itself had no influence on the transfers.
Nevertheless, the official concerned was reprimanded.
Any necessary manual corrections will be signed and dated in the future.
13. 3. 97. [DE Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/27 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA-London), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 81/03) (period from 1 September 1994 to 31 December 1995) 1.1.
This report shall be submitted to the Management Board of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in accordance with Article 57(10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 (a). 1.2.
The Court examined the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the 1994 and 1995 financial years.
Pursuant to Article 57(7) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Director-General.
The latter shall also be responsible for drawing up and submitting the accounts (2), in accordance with the internal financial rules laid down in Article 57 (11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93; the Court of Auditors shall be required to examine the accounts in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This is a report on the Agency's first audit..1.3.
The Court's most important observations are set out in the second part of this report. 1.4 The financial statements for the 1994 and 1995 financial years are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are ensured overall.
OJ L 275, 30.9.1990; Bull.
18. (2) In accordance with the provisions of Article 57(9) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, the accounts for all the Agency's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up as at 31 March 1996,
This accounts were received by the Court on 9 April 1996.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the 1994 and 1995 financial years
During the 1995 financial year, the Agency recovered the Commission's grant (ECU 10.1 million) without issuing the corresponding recovery orders.
Accounting for budgetary operations 1.6.
Until August 1995, there was no journal on commitments and payments for this financial year.
At the end of the year, the Agency established an accounting system.
The Court noted that this system made it possible to modify bookings subsequently, without this being apparent.
In the absence of the commitments, the appropriations available (in breach of Articles 29, 35 and 36 of the Agency's Financial Regulation) were exceeded despite the fact that the Management Director presented an amending budget approved by the Management Board (transfers of appropriations from chapter to chapter).
By August 1995, the Agency has settled all payments through a paying agency.
This additional use of the paying agency procedure is contrary to Article 45 of the Agency's Financial Regulation, which provides for this procedure only for certain types of expenditure. 1.8.
In addition, the Agency did not start accounting for this expenditure until September 1995.
At the end of the financial year on 31 December 1995, some ECU 937 000 had to be settled.
General bill 1.9.
The accounts and budget records were not made until September and December 1995 because of the handling by the paying agency.
This is contrary to accounting practices.

13. 3. 97 I EN Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/31 REPLY OF THE EMEA 1.6.
The commercial accounting systems available on the market do not take into account the specificities of Community financial rules.
For this reason, in 1995 the agencies published a call for tenders for a system adapted to their needs.
Until the introduction of the new system, the Agency works with a spreadsheet system.
Although this system can be used to make subsequent changes to the accounts, it would not be possible for them to be found in the accounts of budgetary operations.
However, these amendments are to be found in the general accounts.
All budgetary operations are documented in the case.
During the start-up period, until the appointment of the financial controller in the house, a paying agency was indispensable for the proper functioning of the Agency.
This is the only way to speed up the decision by the Member States on the establishment of the Agency.
With the entry into service of the financial controller, the paying agency was less used and closed at the end of July 1995.
75 % of the payments made by the paying agency were settled on 1 December 1995.
Even if a large amount could not be settled until 1996, the Agency achieved a satisfactory final result and did its best in difficult circumstances.
This report is submitted to the Committee on Budgets of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, in accordance with Article 137 of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 (*). 1.2.
The Court examined the financial statements of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 119(2)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 (2), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the President of the Office.
Whereas the Court of Auditors is also responsible, in accordance with Article 137 of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94, for the preparation and presentation of the accounts (3), having regard to the internal rules on financial control; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is obliged to examine the accounts;
This is a report on the Office's first audit. 1.3.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for the 1994 and 1995 financial years Commission grant 1.5.
During the 1995 financial year, the Office only paid ECU 6.8 million (68 %) of the grant granted.
OJ L 11, 14.1.1994, p. 33.
(3) In accordance with Article 137(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94, the accounts of all the Office's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up on 29 March 1996, signed by the President of the Office and forwarded to the Commission, the Committee on Budgets and the Court of Auditors.
This accounting was received by the Court on 2 April 1996.
The tables in the annex to this report give these financial statements in abbreviated form.
The Court considers that the Office should have issued a recovery order for the entire budget (ECU 10.1 million) in order to be able to comply with the commitments carried over to the 1996 financial year (ECU 4.6 million).
During the 1995 financial year, the Office established a system of accounting.
This is contrary to the internal financial regulation (Articles 4(1) and 29(1)).
Transfers and transfers 1.7.
The appropriations carried over to 1996 represent 46% of the budget and relate primarily to computer equipment (Titles II and III of the budget).
The appropriations available were also transferred from Title I (staff) to Title II (technical expenditure) totalling ECU 2,529 million (25 % of the budget).
The inventory is kept only in terms of quantity but not in terms of value.
It is therefore not possible to coordinate with the amounts shown in the Office's balance sheet.
The administrative system set up by the Office does not guarantee adequate separation of tasks and proper implementation of the provisions relating to revenue, commitments and payments (authorising officer, financial controller and accounting officer).
The office is currently housed in a building of the Spanish government.
However, there is no contract for the use of this building.
The Office should clarify the need for the accommodation of its services with a view to the future provision of its final seat.
13.3.97 I DE 1 Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/33 This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 26 September 1996.

No C 81/36 p 5. Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3. 97 REPLY OF THE AMTES Commission grant 1.5.
The need for a recovery order was not known to the Commission or to the OHIM.
The OHIM has taken note of this observation by the Court of Auditors and has caused a recovery order for the 1996 financial year to be issued without delay for the total amount of the grant less the provisions.
Accounting for budgetary operations 1.6. It is true that the accounting system currently used by the OHIM allows subsequent changes to the accounts.
For the period up to the introduction of the Sincom2 system developed by the Commission, OHIM has provided organisational arrangements for additional security guarantees for the use of the current system.
Until then, OHIM has no other option but to wait for the Commission's accounting system, which is likely to be available before the end of the year, because the development of such a system means a great financial burden that an office cannot bear on its own.
In 1995, the Office's budget was adopted in the light of a provision of ECU 2 million requested by Parliament for an overall budget of ECU 10.1 million.
The provision was cancelled in two stages: — ECU 1 million in October 1995, — the balance in November 1995.
The temporary blocking of funds has, of course, had an effect on their use, in particular the funds under Title I (personnel), as there was uncertainty as to whether the provisions would be effectively repealed.
OHIM could not, under any circumstances, engage in recruiting staff as long as payment of salaries was not guaranteed by the end of the financial year.
Following the release of the provisions, measures were taken to make use of the appropriations released, in the budget lines where time limits for the commitment procedures still allowed and where there was real need.
For this reason, the Office has requested a transfer from Title I to Title II in order to create mainly computer material which was particularly needed during the start-up phase of the Office.
It should be recalled that OHIM began its activities on 1 April 1996 and that more than 30 000 trade mark applications have been received since then, while the workload was estimated at 15 000 applications for the whole financial year.
Inventory 1.8. At the time of audit by the Court, OHIM had only just received from the Commission the software for computerised management of the inventory; it was just installed at that time.
Division of tasks 1.9.
A question to the Court of Auditors made it clear that this item concerns the order of signatures which must be respected in the budget commitment and payment procedures.
It is therefore not a confusion as to the duties of the authorising officer, the accounting officer and the financial controller.
This approach had the advantage that, in the initial phase of the Office, when there was not yet a fund manager, it was ensured that the funds were available before an operation was signed by the authorising officer. Since the OHIM now has a fund manager, the sequence of signatures given below can be observed in the various budget documents: 1. Budget manager, 2. Authorising officer, 3. Financial controller, 4. Accounting officer.
Property, plant and equipment 1.10.
There is an agreement (see copy in Annex) between the Minister of Industry of the Spanish Government
On the basis of this agreement, the Spanish authorities shall make available to the Office free of charge a building (temporary seat), the building in which the Office is currently situated.
Under this agreement, the Spanish Government will take measures to provide the Office with a permanent seat.
The decision on the site and the specifications for the invitation to tender for the building to be constructed was taken by the Spanish authorities on 3 July 1996.
This specification shall be published on 30 July of this year in the Official Journal of the European Communities (S series — Calls and Tenders).
Following these recent developments, the Office will take the necessary steps without delay.
This report shall be submitted to the Management Board of the European Training Foundation in accordance with Article 11(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 of 7 May 1990 0.
The Court has examined the financial statements of the European Training Foundation for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 11(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90, the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Director.
Whereas, in accordance with Article 11 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 (2), the Court of Auditors is also responsible for drawing up and presenting the accounts, and must comply with internal financial rules; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is required to examine these accounts;
This is a report on the Foundation's first audit.
The Court carried out its audit in accordance with the generally accepted audit standards in so far as they apply to the Community context.
It has carried out audits of the accounts and applied other audit procedures deemed necessary in this context.
The main comments resulting from the Court's audit are set out in the second part of this report.
(2) In accordance with Article 11(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90, the accounts of all the Foundation's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up on 31 March 1996, signed by the Director of the Foundation and forwarded to the Commission, the Management Board and the Court of Auditors.
The tables in the annex to this report represent these financial statements in abbreviated form.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the 1994 and 1995 financial years Accounting for budgetary operations 1.5.
This system and the systematic implementation through the paying agency can lead to overruns of funds.
Paying Agency 1.6.
The Foundation carried out all payments through a paying agency in 1995.
This is not compatible with Article 43 of the Financial Regulation for the Foundation, which provides for this procedure only for certain types of expenditure.
In addition, the accounts for this expenditure were delayed as the relevant documents had to be sent to the financial controller for approval in Brussels.
The Foundation has allocated a total of ECU 0.4 million to make use of the resources still available at the end of the financial year.
However, it has failed to comply with the procurement rules, in particular with regard to price or performance competition (Articles 45 to 51 of the Financial Regulation for the Foundation).
Financial controller 1.8.
In view of the current situation, the Foundation's internal control system could be improved by assigning it to a Commission financial controller on-the-spot.

Accounting - The Foundation shares the opinion of the Court of Auditors.
It has also played a crucial role in the establishment of a single system for the management of the budget and the accounting system in all departments.
Discussions are under way with the Commission's departments responsible, which will enable us to overcome all the concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors by introducing a new system for the management of the budget, which will enter into force on 1 January 1997.
In this context, it should be stressed that none of the budget allocations had been exceeded over the period under review.
1.6. Management of advance payments It must be stressed that the advance payments had not been used for all purchases of equipment or for the participation in real estate, which represented a significant part of the budget.
In addition, the use of the general advance payments has at present been reduced in accordance with Article 43 of the Financial Regulation and all invoices of a given month will be sent to the auditor in Brussels within the 10th and 20th of the following month.
Contracts On the one hand, the contracts under discussion, closely linked to the activities and projects of the Foundation's work programme, represent an extremely small proportion of the Foundation's activities, both in terms of number and budget.
On the other hand, it is true that the inclusion of the competition that led to these contracts was informal.
This procedure was chosen at the time mainly on the basis of urgency.
In addition, the contracts under discussion had the task of organising conferences and seminars on behalf of and on behalf of the Foundation and under its strict control.
The budget was divided into two parts: the fixed part of the remuneration (less than ECU 12 000) and the operational part, which was pre-defined by the Foundation and reimbursed on the basis of the supporting documents.
On the basis of these elements, the Foundation considered that the actual contract amount would not exceed ECU 12 000.
When it became clear at the beginning of 1996 that the Court of Auditors did not share this view, this system was abandoned.
Accountants The Foundation shares the opinion of the Court of Auditors.
This report shall be submitted to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency in accordance with Article 13(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 19901.
The Court has examined the financial statements of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 13(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the budget was implemented under the reply of the Executive Director.
The Court of Auditors shall also be responsible for drawing up and presenting the accounts (2), in accordance with the internal financial rules provided for in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 0; in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors shall be required to examine these accounts.
The Court has carried out its audit in accordance with the generally accepted audit standards to the extent that they are applicable to the Community context.
It has carried out audits of the accounts and applied other audit procedures considered necessary in this context.
The financial statements for 1994 and 1995 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are guaranteed overall.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Commission assistance 1.5.
During the 1995 financial year, the Agency has only part of the legislation contained in its budget (i1) OJ L 120, 11.5.1990, p. 4.
(2) In accordance with Article 13(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the accounts for all the Agency's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up on 20 June 1996, signed by the Executive Director of the Agency and forwarded to the Commission, the Management Board and the Court of Auditors.
The accounts were received by the Court of Auditors on 29 June 1996.
The tables in the annex to this report show these financial statements in abridged form. The Commission grants (budget: ECU 12 million — appropriations recovered: ECU 6.2 million).
The Court considers that the Agency should have issued a recovery order during the 1995 financial year for the outstanding balance (ECU 5.8 million) in order to meet the commitments carried over to the 1996 financial year (ECU 7 million in total).
Titles I (staff expenditure) and II (technical expenditure) of the budget have identified a number of overruns of some ECU 0.4 million in total.
This amount, which could not be charged to the 1995 budget, is shown on the assets side of the balance sheet in a depositary account and must be charged to the 1996 budget (in breach of Articles 5, 27, 29c and 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation).
Paying agency 1.7.
Almost all payments to be charged to Titles I and II of the budget have been settled through a paying agency.
The use of this paying agency is not compatible with Article 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation as the imprest administrator at that time was both the accounting officer and the budget manager of some budget lines.
Furthermore, the deadlines for the submission of supporting documents have not been complied with and the availability of committed appropriations for payments has not been verified.
This seems to be the main reason for the above-mentioned excesses.
Transfers 1.8.
As at the end of 1994, a very large proportion of the available appropriations was carried over at the end of 1995 (7 million ECU — 57.2% of the total).
Most transfers concerned Title III (operational expenditure) (ECU 6.4 million — 90.3% of the appropriations entered in this Title).
A large part (ECU 1.8 million) of the ECU 8.5 million carried over from 1994 to 1995 had to be cancelled (21% of the carry-overs).
Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3. 97 Subsequent referral to the Financial Controller 1.9.
Several commitments totalling ECU 0.5 million were submitted to the financial controller after the end of the year.
I n these cases, the financial control authority has refused to give its approval, which the Board of Directors has disregarded.
The Court underlines the obligation to comply with the Financial Regulation, according to which "for all measures that could lead to expenditure at the expense of the budget" (Article 27 of the Financial Regulation for the Agency), a prior application for commitment must be made in accordance with the rules.
The division of tasks was not respected in the administrative department of the Agency.
The lack of accounting staff meant that the same person was also the accounting officer, the administrator and the manager of some budget lines.
Accounting systems 1.11.
Two independent systems are used for the accounting of budgetary operations and for general accounting.
Moreover, the accounting system for budgetary operations does not provide for any spe cialities if the available or committed appropriations are exceeded.
Financial controller 1.12.
The Management Board has appointed the financial controller of the Commission as financial controller.
On the basis of the current functioning of the Agency, the Court considers that it is appropriate to assign it a financial control body, which was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 28 October 1996.

• The European Environment Agency was established in Copenhagen in mid-1994.
A first budget of ECU 10.2 million was adopted on 31 October 1994.
Since the decision on the seat of the Agency had been delayed, work had to be carried out particularly quickly at the beginning of the work of the Environment Agency.
Projects were identified and commitments made before the end of the year thanks to a large amount of labour, but for obvious reasons the implementation of commitments could hardly begin before the end of 1994.
In 1995, the Agency faced the difficult task of implementing not only the 1994 budget but also a new budget of ECU 10.5 million for 1995, before the regular staff of the Agency began their duties.
The Agency's vacancies were advertised in November 1994 and, after a lengthy selection procedure with over 7 000 applications, the first selected candidates began their work in the summer of 1995.
In short, the Agency had an ambitious work programme and practically two budgets, but had only a very limited number of staff for this task.
Nevertheless, the work progressed and in 1995 major projects such as the Dobris Management Report and the revision of the 5th Environmental Action Plan were completed.
Five European thematic contact centres were set up and the development of EIONET was progressing.
The Agency's regular staff increased by 1 person on 1 January 1995 (supported by 10 temporary staff, such as national experts and auxiliary staff) and reached the level of 22 regular staff on 31 December 1995 who continued to support 10 temporary staff.
The administrative machinery of the Agency has gradually been expanded as the same open recruitment procedure has been applied.
Nevertheless, in 1995, the Agency was clearly not sufficiently equipped to cope with the procedural and financial aspects of the work.
As far as the financial side is concerned, only one person was available in the first half of the year to deal with the financial, budgetary and contractual aspects of the work programme.
In June 1995, the Head of the Administrative Department began his service and only at the beginning of 1996 did the other staff for financial and contract matters come in.
The Agency did its job, but in the area of finance and budget, some mistakes were made in relation to the prescribed procedures.
Overruns Some budget lines have been overrun.
On the one hand, this was because the Agency's budgetary control system did not function satisfactorily and on the other hand some payments made were not accounted for, as the Agency's financial department was clearly understaffed.
As a result, the clearance of accounts showed a discrepancy between the accounting system and the payments actually made, which appeared as an overdraft of certain budget lines.
As there will no longer be any settlement between different budget lines after 1 January, these amounts will have to be included in the 1996 accounts, i.e. financed from the 1996 budget.
In 1996, expenditure and appropriations available under Titles I and II (i.e. the 1995 problem points) were carefully monitored to avoid an expenditure surplus.
Unobserved procedures (subsequent referral to the financial controller) A work programme was drawn up during the establishment phase of the Agency and its implementation started before the administrative procedures were clearly defined and a corresponding administrative structure was available to monitor compliance with the procedures.
In some cases, this led to work being commissioned and carried out, excluding certain procedural rules.
In particular, work was commissioned without the approval of the financial controller in Brussels having been obtained before, which is a prerequisite for this type of operational expenditure.
The error was purely procedural and was justified in the fact that work had to be done, but that the necessary administrative structures to ensure compliance with the rules laid down by Brussels had not yet been set up.
There has been a clear delegation of powers and staff are informed of the procedural rules.
Separation of tasks As in all public institutions, certain functions of a financial technical nature should also remain separate with the Environment Agency.
One of the basic principles is that commitments and payment orders should not be made by the same person.
However, during the construction period of the Agency in Copenhagen, the number of staff was so low that this principle could not be adhered to.
This fact is rightly objected to by the Court of Auditors.
In the case of the Environment Agency, the financial controller of the Agency and that of the Commission shall be one and the same person established in Brussels.
This would significantly impede the work of the Agency.
The way out of this dilemma is to set up a paying agency.
I m principle, it works like a small cash reserve, although the amounts dealt with above are quite significant.
Instead of obtaining the prior approval of the financial control, the agency orders the payment and sends once a month the establishment of the procedures by the paying agency for subsequent approval of the financial control.
On the one hand, this will facilitate the work of the paying agency, but on the other hand, it is also a two-dimensional sword, as internal control of the agency and the financial department must be able to meet this additional responsibility.
The Court of Auditors' complaint is understandable in this respect, but as long as the financial controller is based in Brussels, the Agency does not see any alternance as an extensive claim of the paying agency. · For this reason, the Agency has taken the Court of Auditors' recommendation with great interest that the Agency's Commission be able to appoint a financial advisor.The Environment Agency would welcome such a step.
Computerised accounting system The Court of Auditors stresses the need for the Agency to implement a modern accounting system covering both general accounting and budgetary control.
Such a computerised system is essential for the EU's complicated financial system if we are to avoid large amounts of money being tied to finance and budgetary work.
The Environment Agency wholeheartedly supports the Court of Auditors' conclusions.
Since the beginning of 1995, the Agency has repeatedly tried to find a solution to this problem.
It will, by the way, be in the same form for the other EU agencies.
In 1996, the agencies issued a joint call for proposals, which however remained unsuccessful, i.e. no satisfactory system was found.
The Agency is currently examining the possibility of using the new Sincom 2 budgetary control system.
The plan states that it should be installed and operational in good time in order to implement the 1997 budget.
But there will continue to be a soft spot for budgetary control and another for general accounting.
Payments will also not be integrated into the software. The agency will continue to look for a suitable solution to these problems and try to coordinate this work with the other agencies.
13.3.97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/49 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA-Lisbon), together with the Centre's replies (97IC 81/07) (period from 1 November 1994 to 31 December 1995) 1.1 This report was submitted to the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction pursuant to Article 11(11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 of 8 February 1993 n. 1.2.
The Court examined the financial statements of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 11(8) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 (2), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Director.
In accordance with Article 11(10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 (2), as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 3294/94 of 22 December 1994 (3), the latter is also responsible for drawing up and presenting the accounts (4).
The Court of Auditors is required to examine this account in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This is a report on the first review of the Observatory.
The Court carried out its audit in accordance with the generally accepted audit standards, to the extent that they are applicable to the Community context.
It has carried out checks on the accounts and applied other audit procedures deemed necessary in this context.
The financial statements for 1994 and 1995 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions is ensured overall.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Commission grant 1.5.
In 1995 the Centre only issued a recovery order for 57% (ECU 3 million) of the grant and recovered the corresponding funds.
The Court considers that the Centre should also have issued a recovery order for the ECU 2.3 million (ECU 5.3 million) shown in the balance sheet in order to meet the commitments carried over to the 1996 financial year (ECU 2.8 million).
Aid granted by the Portuguese Government 1.6.
An amount of ECU 614 015 (including interest) made available by the Portuguese Government to the Centre for the Establishment of the Centre is not entered in the budget as revenue but only in the balance sheet.
Accounting for budgetary operations 1.7.
This may lead to overruns of funds.
Paying agency 1.8.
During 1995 the Centre spent a large part (45%) of its expenditure on paying agencies.
The systematic use of the paying agency procedure is not compatible with Article 43 of the Financial Regulation for the Centre, which provides for this procedure only for certain types of expenditure.
Moreover, the accounts for this expenditure were delayed, as the supporting documents had to be sent to the financial controller in Brussels.
In 1995, substantial appropriations were transferred to 1996, i.e. ECU 2.8 million, representing 52% of the Centre's budget.
Some appropriations, which had been carried over from 1994 to 1995 (totaling ECU 4.607 million), had to be cancelled (0.368 million ECU, i.e. 8% of the appropriations carried over).
Division of tasks 1.10.
Financial controller 1.11.
With a view to the current situation, the internal control system could be improved by allocating a financial controller on the spot.

The following remarks concern the Court of Auditors' most important comments on the implementation of the EMCDDA budget for 1994 and 1995 (points 1.5 to 1.11 of the Court of Auditors' observations).
The EMCDDA shares the Court's view that it would have been more appropriate to issue a recovery order for all the appropriations entered in the balance sheet as a grant to the Commission, and that the 1996 budget was managed accordingly. b)The Portuguese Government (point 1.6 of the Court's observations) The EMCDDA acted in accordance with the Commission's financial control rules (which is also the EMCDDA's financial controller). within the meaning of Article 54 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Article 82 of the implementing rules for the same (in accordance with the spirit of Article 142 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities) the EMCDDA first used the payment account for the expenditure referred to in Article 54 of the abovementioned implementing rules.
However, the EMCDDA is aware that this can only be a provisional system (based on Excel) and that it needs a more efficient accounting system.
In this context, the decentralised agencies (including the EMCDDA) launched a call for proposals at the end of December 1995 under the coordination of the European Training Foundation in Turin with the aim of equipping themselves with an integrated computerized system for general accounting and accounting.
No. C 81/54 - EN - 97 - Official Journal of the Communities 13. 3. 97 For the following financial years, the EMCDDA is implementing a plan for the programming and control of the implementation of the budget and its work programme, which is intended to improve the use of the appropriations allocated and, in particular, to limit transfers to exceptional cases. f) Separation of tasks (point 1.10 of the Court of Auditors' observations) C Due to its very limited staff in 1994 and 1995, the EMCDDA was unable to fully ensure compliance with the principle of separation of tasks, as the Court of Auditors pointed out.
The separation of the duties of authorising officer, financial controller and accounting officer as required by Article 16 of the OEDT Financial Rules for the duties of authorising officer has been fully complied with.
The EMCDDA is already working to ensure that the various tasks involved are separated.
In this context, it shall take into account, as far as possible, the requirements communicated by the Court of Auditors in defining their short-term personnel needs, in order to ensure that the administrative tasks referred to by the Court of Auditors (payment management, accounting, management of staff or contracts) are carried out by different persons.
Such proposals will be submitted to the EMCDDA's Management Board. g) Financial Controller (point 1.11 of the Court of Auditors' observations) The EMCDDA's Management Board opened a negative decision on the delegation of the tasks of the financial controller to an EMCDDA staff member when the EMCDDA's financial rules were adopted in June (in particular on the basis of the European Commission's objections).
Since the European Commission's financial controller is also the EMCDDA's financial controller, it would also be up to the Commission to review the feasibility of the possible designation of a financial controller on the spot, taking account of the rules on this issue in the other decentralised agencies.

This report is addressed to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency in agreement with Article 13 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (1).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director in agreement with the requirements of Article 13 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90. His responsibility includes the preparation and presentation of the accounts (2) in agreement with the internal financial provisions set out in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court of Auditors to audit these accounts.
This report constitutes the first audit of the Agency.
The Court conducted its audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in so far as they are applicable in the Community context.
The Court carried out checks on the accounts and records and also applied search additional auditing procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The main observations resulting from the Court's audit are presented in the second part of this report.
The financial statements for the financial years 1994 and 1995 are reliable and the underlying operations were carried out, on the whole, in agreement with the rules concerning legality and regularity.
Main observations concerning the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995 The Commission subsidy 1.5.
During the financial year 1995 the Agency used only part of the Commission subsidiary provided for in the general budget (ECU 12 million, of which ECU 6.2 million was drawn down).
It is the Court's opinion that the Agency should have issued a recovery order during the financial year 1995 for the balance remaining due (ECU 5,8 million) in order to meet the commitments that were carried over to the financial year 1996 (totaling ECU 7 million).
Spending in excess of available approvals 1.6.
Several cases of expenditure in excess of available appropriations, spending to approximate ECU 0.4 million altogether, were found under headings I (staff expenditure) and II (administrative expenditure) of the budget.
This http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997... 26/10/2010
EUR-Lex - 31997Y0313(06) - EN Page 2 of 5 amount, which could not be charged to the budget for 1995, was entered on the assess side of the balance sheet in a suspense account, and had to be charged to the budget for the financial year 1996 (contravention of Articles 5, 27, 29c and 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation).
Imprest account 1.7.
Almost all payments charged to the budget under tits I and II were made via an imprest account.
The utilization of this account was not in agreement with Article 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation, since the administrator of the imprest accounts was, at the time, both the Accounting and the Authorizing Officer for certain budget heads.
Furthermore, the deadlines for the submission of supporting documents were not met and the availability of approaches committed was not verified before payments were made.
This situation seems to be the principal cause of the cases of spending in excess of available approaches pointed out out above.
Approvals carried forward 1.8.
At the end of the financial year 1995, as was already the case at the end of the financial year 1994, the percentage of approvals carried forward was very high in relation to the approvals available (ECU 7 million - 57.2% of the total budget).
The majority of these carryovers concern title III (ECU 6.4 million, representing 90.3% of the appropriations under this title).
A large share (ECU 1.8 million) of the approvals carried over from 1994 to 1995, totalling ECU 8.5 million, had to be cancelled (21% of the approvals carried over).
A posteriori referral to the Financial Controller 1.9.
Several proposals for the commitment of funds totalling ECU 0.5 million were submitted, a posteriori, to the Financial Controller for his approval.
In these cases, the Financial Controller withheld his approach, but this refusal was overruled by the Management Board.
The Court wishes to emphasize the obligation to respect the Financial Regulation and to submit proposals for commitments in due form prior to 'any measure of a child which might lead to expenditure from the budget' (Article 27 of the Agency's Financial Regulation).
Separation of duties 1.10.
The separation of duties within the administration of the Agency has not been observed.
Due to a summer of staff in the financial accounting department, the same person was, at one and the same time, Accounting Officer, administrator of the imprest accounts and Authorizing Officer for certain budget heads.
Accounting systems 1.11.
The budgetary accounting and general accounting are carried out on two independent and unrelated computer systems.
The budgetary accounting system is, moreover, not programmed to refuse entries in the event of approvals available, or approvals committed, being exceeded.
The Financial Controller 1.12.
The Management Board appointed the Commission's Financial Controller as their own Financial Controller.
The Court considers it would be advisable, in respect of the Agency's present mode of operation, to appoint a full-time Financial Controller for the Agency.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at the Court meeting of 28 October 1996. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...

(2) Contrary to the requirements of Article 13 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the accounts for all revenue and expenditure of the Agency in respect of the financial year 1995 were not prepared until 20 June 1996, the date on which the accounts were signed by the Executive Director of the Agency and sent to the Commission, to the Board of Management and to the Court of Auditors.
These accounts were received by the Court on 28 June 1996.
The abandoned version of these financial statements is presented in the tables annexed to this report.
THE AGENCY'S REPLIES The European Environment Agency was established in Copenhagen in mid-1994.
A first budget of ECU 10.2 million was adopted already on 31 October 1994.
Since the decision on where to locate the Agency had been delayed a fast start was needed.
Through a significant effect, projects could be identified and the budget committed before the end of the year, but for previous reasons the execution of the commitments could be well started before the end of 1994.
Thus, in 1995 the Agency faced the daunting task of executing, not only the budget from 1994 but also a new budget for 1995 of ECU 10.5 million, and this before the regular staff of the Agency had taken up duty.
The vacant posts in the Agency were published in November 1994 and the selected candidates started coming on board in summer 1995 after a long selection procedure involving more than 7 000 applications.
In short, the Agency had an ambitious work program and virtually two budgets to execute, but very limited staff for the task.
Despite this, work went ahead and in 1995 the Agency finalized major projects, like the Dobris assessment, the review of the fifth environmental action plan.
Five European topic centres were established and the build-up of the EIONET advanced.
The build-up of the Agency progressed with regular staff increasing from 1 on 1 January 1995 (supported by 10 temporary staff, for example national experts and auxiliary staff) to 22 on 31 December 1995, still supported by 10 temporary staff.
The Agency's administration has progressively developed since the same open procedure to recruit was applied.
Nevertheless, it was clearly too understaffed in 1995 to handle the procedural and financial aspects of the work.
On the finance side only one person was available to handle the financial, budgetary and contractual aspects of the work programme during the first half of the year.
In June 1995 the Head of Administration took up duty, and only in the beginning of 1996 did the rest of the finance and contract staff come on board.
The Agency rose to the challenge, but some mistakes of a procedural nature were made in the areas of finance and budget.
Overspending There was overspending on some budget lines.
The season was, on the one http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...
26/10/2010
EUR-Lex - 31997Y0313(06) - EN Page 4 of 5 hand, that the Agency's budgetary monitoring system did not function in a satisfactory way and on the other hand some executed payments were not introduced due to the fact that the Agency was seriously understaffed in the finance department.
As a consequence, when the accounts were closed, the discrepancy between the accounts and the payments actually made, showed up as overspending on some budget lines.
Since no adjustment between budget lines can be made after 1 January, this has to be booked on the 1996 accounts, i.e. be financed from the 1996 budget.
In 1996 the expenses and the availability of approvals in titles I and II, which was where the problems occurred in 1995, were carefully monitored in order to avoid overspending.
Procedures overlooked (Saisine a posteriori) During the build-up of the Agency, a work program was established and started being executed before administrative procedures had been well established and an administration in place to monitor that procedures were followed.
In some cases this led to work being ordered and carried out without all the procedures being observed.
In particular, work was contracted without the Financial Controller in Brussels having given his visa which is a prerequisite for this kind of operational expenditure.
It was not a question of finances being lost or that the finances were not there.
The mistake was procedural and reflected that work had to be done and the procedures to ascertain that this was done according to Community rules were not yet in place.
Procedures are now in place to avoid similar problems.
A clear delegation of authorizing powers have been established and staff informed of the rules.
Separation of functions In the financial framework of the Agency, as is the case in all public institutions, certain functions should be kept separate.
A basic principle is that the same person should not commit money and order payment.
However, during the period of establishment of the Agency in Copenhagen the number of staff in the Agency was so small that it was not possible to observe this principal.
This is legally criticalized by the Court of Auditors.
However, once the staffing of the Agency started to increase this was corrected and these functions have been rigorously separated in the Agency since 1995.
Extensive use of imprest accounts The normal procedure forcommitting and ordering payments in the EU system is to have prior approval by the Financial Controller in practice all cases.
In the case of the Agency, the Agency Financial Controller is the same as the Commission's and located in Brussels.
To send all financial transactions to Brussels for approval before they could actually be executed would be an excessively tiresome procedure.
It would seriously obstruct the working of the Agency.
The way out of this dilemma is the imprest account.
It works in principle as a petty-cash reserve oldough the amounts involved are important.
Instead of seeing prior approval from Financial Control, the Agency executes the payment and once a month the imprest account is sent to the Financial Controller to have the ex post approval of the payments which have been made.
On the one hand this facilitates the functioning of the Agency, but, on the other hand, it is a double-edged word since the Agency's internal controls and the financial department must have the capacity to handle this additional responsibility.
Thus, the criticism by the Court of Auditors is understandable, but as long as http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...
EUR-Lex - 31997Y0313(06) - EN Page 5 of 5 the Financial Controller is located in Brussels there is, in the Agency's view no alternative to an extensive use of the imprest account.
It is there with great interest that the Agency has noted the recommendation by the Court of Auditors that the Financial Controller of the Commission should place a Financial Controller in the Agency.
The Agency would welcome this step.
Computerized financial system The Court of Auditors underlines the need for the Agency to find an up-to-date computerized financial system which can integrate the accounting side with the budget monitoring side.
In the complicated financial system of the European Union such a computerized system is crucial to avoid having to tie down a lot of resources in financial and budgetary work.
The Agency supports whyheartedly the conclusion by the Court of Auditors.
Since the beginning of 1995, the Agency has again and again tried to find a solution to this problem.
It is a problem which the European Environment Agency shares with the other EU Agencies.
In 1996, the Agencies launched a joint call for tenders to find a solution but this call for tenders has not been successful, i.e. no satisfactory system has been found.
Thus, the Agency is at present pursuing the possibility of using the new budget monitoring system Sincom 2. The plan is to have it installed and operational in time to execute the 1997 budget on the basis of this system.
There will be still one software for the budget monitoring system and another for the general leather.
Nor will the imprest accounts be integrated in the software the Agency will continue to look for an efficient way of solving these problems and will endeavour to coordinate this work with the other Agencies.

19.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 309/25 INTRODUCTION 1. The European Environment Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (1).
The Agency's mission is to set up an environmental monitoring network to provide the Commission, the Member States and the general public with reliable information on the state of the environment.
This information should give the European Union and the Member States, in particular, the ability to take measures to protect the environment and to assess the effectiveness of these measures.
2. Table 1 summarises the Agency's capabilities and capabilities.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide information on the main elements of the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 2006.
This declaration is submitted to the European Parliament and the Council pursuant to Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (2). It is based on an examination of the Agency's accounts, which the Court must carry out pursuant to Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 (3) were drawn up in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 by its Executive Director, and forwarded to the Court, which gives an explanation of the adequacy of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
5. The Court carried out its examination in compliance with the guidelines for financial control and the INTOSAI Code of Obligations and Code of Conduct as well as the international professional principles for the final examination of IFAC, if these are applicable in the Community context.
The examination was planned and carried out with a view to obtaining adequate assurance that the annual accounts are reliable and that the underlying assumptions are correct and orderly.
6. The Court shall have an adequate basis for the following accrual declaration. The financial statements of the Agency for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 shall be subject to all substantive provisions.
The following remarks do not call into question the Court's declaration of sovereignty.
COMMENTS 7. About 30 % of the commitments of the financial year had to be transferred.
Operational expenditure (Title III and assigned revenue) was carried over more than half of the appropriations.
These transfers were partly not justified: in the last two months of 2006, the agency made commitments of EUR 1.3 million, but transferred the corresponding payments to 2007.
A sampling (4) of these transfers showed that they were all related to 2007-to-2007 activities.
The budgetary principle of prudence has therefore not been strictly applied.
8. The authorising officer, who was subordinated, not only carried out ex-ante controls, but also managed the access rights to the electronic accounting system, which constitutes a violation of the principle of separation of duties.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 27 September 2007.

C 309/28 EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.12.2007 ANSWER OF THE AGENCY The higher proportion of transfers to 2007 is mainly due to exceptional events in 2006, which led us to postpone interim payments to thematic centres until the satisfactory delivery of the services.
The reasons for the commitments received were the obligation to conclude licensing agreements before 1 January each year in order to maintain the continuity, as well as the time needed to define and negotiate the costs and time limits for complex new work.
The Agency will continue to reduce the proportion of transfers in this context.
The risks associated with the described situation were assessed by the management and controls were carried out to reduce the risks.
The remaining risk is considered acceptable.
This situation is being reassessed as part of a safety-sensitive task to be carried out in mid-2007.

C 309/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.12.2007 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 7. The Agency implements a very accelerated procedure for the implementation of aid programmes.
The last allocation to the Agency for assistance amounted to EUR 250 million in 2006, which will be distributed over three years, which will run until 2009.
In the first six months of 2007, the Agency obtained aid of EUR 185 million, representing 74% of annual funding.
Therefore, the balance to be awarded at the end of the mandate is expected to be small.

5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/43 INTRODUCTION 1. The European Agency for Reconstruction (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1628/96(1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1756/2006 of 28 November 2006 (2).
It was also extended to Serbia and Montenegro as well as to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Agency implements programmes to promote institution building and good governance in order to support the establishment of the market economy and basic infrastructures and strengthen civil society.
2. Table 1 summarises the Agency's obligations and responsibilities.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide information on the main elements of the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 2007.
This declaration is submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (3).
It bases itself on the examination of the Agency's invoice, which the Court must carry out pursuant to Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
4. The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 (4) were drawn up by its Director in accordance with Article 8(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 (5) and forwarded to the Court, which provides a statement of the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
5. The Court carried out its examination in accordance with the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) and the International Professional Foundations for Final Professionals of IFAC(6), provided they are applicable in the Community context.
The audit was planned and carried out with a view to obtaining adequate assurance that the financial statements are reliable and that the underlying proposals are correct and orderly.
OJ L 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1.
OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 1.
(4) The annual accounts were drawn up on 10 July 2008 and received by the Court on 16 July 2008.
(6) ISSAI is the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions; IFAC is the International Federation of Accountants.
6. The Court shall have an appropriate basis for the following declaration of assurance: Indemnity of the accounts The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 shall be valid in all essential respects.
The following remarks do not call into question the Court's declaration of eligibility.
COMMENTS 7. The Agency's 2007 budget amounted to EUR 25.2 million, compared with EUR 268.8 million in the previous year.
Although the budget implementation rate was satisfactory at the end of the year, the Agency at that time had lost EUR 453 million for operational activities, EUR 163 million, which had not yet been committed, and EUR 290 million for payments to existing commitments.
Since the Agency's activities are set to last for several years, these activities will have to be carried out partly beyond the year 2008 (the last year of the Agency's existence).
8. The Agency's mandate shall expire on 31 December 2008.
On 24 April 2008, the European Commission adopted a decision to transfer the programmes previously managed by the Agency, and on 11 June 2008 it issued a note with instructions and guidelines for the transfer of the programme and contract documents.
This note does not cover all the posts of the Agency's review.
In order to ensure that the Agency's programmes and posts are officially transferred, the Agency and the Commission must sign an agreement approved by the Agency's Management Board.
This will facilitate the transfer of items and ensure that they are correctly recorded in the Agency's annual accounts.
C 311/44 DE Official Journal of the European Union 5.12.2008 9. The sum of 180 million euros shown in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2007 reflected, in part, the pre-financing received from the Commission for the pre-financing provided by the Agency on the basis of contracts and grant agreements.
These must also be subordinated to the administrative competence of the European Commission upon expiry of the Agency's mandate.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors at its meeting in Luxembourg on 18 September 2008.

5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/49 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 7. At the end of 2007, the Agency was able to continue with commitments and payments for the annual programmes 2004, 2005 and 2006, given the multi-annual nature of the CARDS programmes.
For CARDS, the deadline for commitment is 2009 and for disbursement is 2010.
The cost of these three programmes was EUR 1.8 billion.
The fact that EUR 163 million (9%) is still committed and a total amount of EUR 453 million (25 %) is still to be paid out three years before the CARDS deadline shows a very high execution rate.
The Court praised the Agency's performance in its Special Report No 5/2007 (OJ C 285, 27.11.2007, p. 1).
8. The Agency does everything in its power to successfully carry out this transfer.
It is about to draw up agreements for the transfer of objects from their relationship with different EU institutions.
In addition, the Agency is in contact with the Commission to formally regulate all aspects of the transfer and will submit the outcome to the Management Board for approval.

5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/21 INTRODUCTION 1. The European Aviation Safety Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002 (1).
The Agency's main tasks are to maintain a high level of civil aviation safety, to ensure the proper development of civil aviation safety, to develop certification specifications and to issue certificates for aeronautical products.
2. Table 1 summarises the Agency's facilities and capabilities.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide information on the main elements of the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 2007.
This declaration is submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council pursuant to Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (2). It is based on the examination of the Agency's accounts, which the Court must carry out pursuant to Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
4. The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 (3) were drawn up in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 by its Executive Director and forwarded to the Court, which makes a statement on the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
5. The Court carried out its examination in conformity with the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) as well as the International Professional Principles for the Final Professionals of IFAC(4), provided they are applicable in the Community context.
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 20 December 2011 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the application of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 346, 20.12.2011, p. 1), as last amended by Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 1).
(3) The annual accounts were drawn up on 30 June 2008 and were received by the Court on 2 July 2008.
(4) ISSAI stands for International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions; IFAC stands for International Federation of Accountants.
6. The Court shall have an appropriate basis for the following statement of assurance: Indemnity of accounts The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 shall be valid in all material respects.
COMMENTS 7. The Agency's 2007 budget amounted to EUR 72.0 million compared to EUR 66.0 million in the previous year.
The Agency's budget is financed from fees and fees for the issuing or modification of approvals or certificates and approvals by the Agency as well as from the Commission's contribution.
8. The 2007 establishment plan provided for 467 temporary staff posts, an increase of 139 posts compared with the 2006 establishment plan.
Since the appropriations for staff expenditure did not cover actual staff expenditure, the Agency decided to reduce the number of recruitments and agreed with the Commission to limit the number of posts to a maximum of 342, of which 333 were occupied at the end of the year.
However, the establishment plan has not been adjusted accordingly.
The Agency should be careful to ensure the reliability of the expenditure forecasts presented to the budgetary authority for adoption.
9. In accordance with the new Rules of Fees, which have been in force since 1 June 2007 (5), the Agency classified appropriations of EUR 14.9 million as assigned revenue in order to cover future costs for the issue of admissions or certificates.
However, this amount has been overestimated, as it also includes charges imposed under the provisions of the old Rules of Procedure.

C 311/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.12.2008 10. In a tendering procedure, the situation for tenderers was unclear because of the lack of clear and complete information about the award criteria and their respective weighting on the one hand and because of the method for financial evaluation on the other hand.
In three other cases (1), a restricted procedure was carried out after a call for expressions of interest, although the total value of the services to be provided was above the threshold from which an open procedure must be initiated.

These financial statements are prepared according to the method of accrual accounting.
C 311/26 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.12.2008 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 8. In the first two years of implementation of the Rules of Procedure, the Agency's revenue was not sufficient to cover the estimated total cost.
The Agency has therefore, as a precautionary measure, decided to reduce its attitudes.
This was reflected in the staff policy plan 2008-2010, which was agreed with the Commission.
9. In 2007 in the transition phase, the old and the new regulations were applied in the same way.
The calculation of assigned revenue from fees and charges is in accordance with Article 64(5) of the basic Regulation (EC) No 216/2008), which states that fees and charges, including those collected in 2007, are assigned revenue.
The basic Regulation does not, in fact, provide for the exclusion of fees collected under the previous regulation.
The exact method of calculation was submitted to the Management Board's Committee on Budgets (28 May 2008).
10. The Agency is fully aware of the need to comply closely with the Commission's procurement rules.
It will pay particular attention to inform potential bidders exactly about the award criteria and their evaluation.

19.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 309/61 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 7. The Agency's budget has been used for more than 50 % of the budget to combat pollution.
In this field, the Agency launched calls for tenders for the award of four vessels specifically designed for pollution control.
At the end of this process, two companies decided to withdraw their offers at the last moment, so that only two companies could be awarded.
This led to the cancellation of payment claims in considerable amount at the end of the year.
8. The move of the agency from Brussels to Lisbon in 2006 had an impact on the budget, which was difficult to predict, including the retirement of nearly 20% of employees.
9. Procedures for avoiding post-commitments will be streamlined.
The conditions of pre-financing are revised in accordance with the Court's remark.
10. ABAC Assets' disposal of the old asset management system in June 2007 is leading to the removal of the problems encountered by the Court.

C 311/58 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.12.2008 INTRODUCTION 1. The European Maritime Safety Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 (1).
The Agency's tasks include the achievement of a high level of maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships, the technical assistance of the Member States and the Commission, and the monitoring of the application of Community legislation and the assessment of its effectiveness.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide information on the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 2007.
4. The Agency's annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 (3) were drawn up in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 by its Executive Director and forwarded to the Court, which provides a statement on the financial years and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
(3) The annual accounts were drawn up on 11 June 2008 and were received by the Court on 2 July 2008.
COMMENTS 7. The Agency's 2007 budget amounted to 48.2 million euros, compared with 44.7 million euros in the previous year.
The Agency's budget is mainly financed by contributions from the European Commission.
The procedures for drawing up the budget have not been sufficiently strict.
This led to a high number of transfers of funds (5), a poor presentation of the budget (6), and the illegal alteration of the source of funding for pollution control measures (7).
8. Legal commitments were made before such commitments were made (8).
(5) More than 32 transfers in 2007.
(6) In the case of separate appropriations, the budget must include a balance sheet of the appropriations for payments due in the next financial year (Article 31(2)(c) of the Agency's Financial Regulation) as a result of commitments made in previous financial years.
(7) From mid-June to December, 25 million euros were granted for measures to prevent pollution by the budget as a similar resource (C1), wrongly transferred to assigned revenue (R0).
(8) Three cases with a total value of 208 000 euros.
5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/59 9. Selection criteria and the minimum number of points required for admission to the next phase of the selection procedure before the start of the evaluation process had not been established.

5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/63 REPLY OF AGENCY 7. The Agency welcomes the observations of the Court of Auditors.
The Agency continues its efforts to improve planning and monitoring.
Particular attention is paid to the forecast and timing of payments.
The necessary transfers in 2007 are within the 10 % threshold under the financial regulation.
On a proposal from the Commission, the Board of Directors decided on 20 March 2007 to use pollution control as assigned revenue, but decided not to treat this as such on 21 November 2007.
8. Measures to avoid post-secondary education are being undermined.
The key factors are training and communication.
9. Following the Court of Auditors' comments, measures were taken to ensure that the selection criteria and the minimum number of points required are established at a earlier date of the selection procedure.
In the light of the forthcoming adoption of the new implementing provisions on the recruitment of temporary staff, the Agency will take into account the Court of Auditors' further comments on the approach to recruitment procedures.

C 393/2 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 THE FINANCIAL STATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 1. This report is addressed to the Council and the European Parliament in conformity with Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 (a) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1946/93 (2).
2. The Court has examined the financial statements of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year ended 31 December 1996.
In agreement with Article 18 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 (3) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (4), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Management Board.
This responsibility included the drawing up and presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the financial provisions as provided for pursuant to Articles 65, 67 and 68 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (4) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 (3).
The Court of Auditors is required within the meaning of Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community to examine these financial statements.
3. The Court undertook its audit in accord with generally accepted auditing standards, in so far as they are applicable in the Community context, and, accordingly, carried out search tests of the accounting records and search other auditing procedures as the Court deemed necessary in the circumstances.
4. In the opinion of the Court the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 1996'are reliable and the underlying transactions are, as a whole, legal and regular.
AUDIT OBSERVATIONS Introduction Background 5. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) was l established by the Council Regulation EEC No 337/75 {) as a satellite body of the European Community with the task of promoting vocational training at Community level.
Cedefop shared operations in Berlin in 1976 and moved to Salonika in 1995.
6. The same Regulation defines its role as that of assisting 'the Commission in encoding, at Community level, the promotion and development of vocational and in-service training', of contributing 'to the implementation of a common vocational training policy' and especially encouraging 'the exchange of information and the comparison of expertise'.
Its main tasks in the field of vocational training are 'to compile documentation, to contribute to the development and coordination of research, to disseminated useful documentation and information, to encourage and support initiatives likely to facilitate a coordinated approach (specifically in respect of the approximation of standards and the mutual recognition of certificates) and to provide a forum for all those affected'.
Scope of the audit 7. The Court carried out a financial audit of the 1996 accounts and has reviewed the Centre's decisions concerning its temporary and permanent premises and staff situation.
Financial data 8. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the financial statements of the Centre.
Available estimates for the financial year 1996 amounted to ECU 14.8 million.
Commitments entered into credit rise to ECU 11.4 million in payments and ECU 2.1 million in carry-overs to the financial year 1997, the balance of ECU 1.3 million having been cancelled.
Approvals carried over from the previous financial year gave rise to ECU 4.2 million in payments and ECU 0.6 million in cancellations.
Table 3 of this report gives an analysis of the utilisation of the approvals for 1996 as well as of those carried over from 1995.
Observations concerning budgetary implementation Separation of duties 9. The Centre has put in place adequate procedures for the separation of duties of authorizing officer, accounting officer and imprest holder (5).
Imprest account 10. A high proportion (in 1996 74%, including sales) of payments continue to be made prior to approval by the Financial" Controller.
Last year (5) the Court recommended that the use of the.imprest account be limited to ongoing or small expenses, where' the risk of irregularities is comparatively low.
A Management Board decision defining which kind of expenses may be paid thrnnph the imnrest account has been established and came into force on 1 January 1997.
Transfers of appropriations 11. The value of transfers of appropriations between different budget lines in 1996 was ECU 891 600 (6 % of the initial budget), down from ECU 922 000 in 1995.
29. 12. 97 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/3 12. Following consultations with and the approach of the different services in the Commission (DG IX, DG XIX and DG XX), the Centre transferred ECU 30 000 from budget line 117 6 'Other services and work sent out for translation and typing' to a newly-created budget line 1 1 1 0 'Auxiliaries', and ECU 40 000 from budget line 1 1 0 0 'Basic sales' to a newly-created budget line 1 1 1 2 'Local agents'.
These new budget lines were created by the Centre.
The Court acknowledges the reasons for making these transfers, but notes that they are contrary to paragraph 4 (a) of Article 21 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 which states: 'appropriations may be transferred only to budget heads for which the statement of expenditure has authorized approvals or carried a token entry'.
The same budget lines are also included in the 1997 budget with approval of the Budgetary Authority.
Carry-overs and cancellations of approvals 13. The volume of approvals carried over has increased in 1996.
Approximately 77% of final admissions for 1996 were paid out in 1996 as compared with 61% in 1995.
The percentage of commitments made and carried over to 1997'was 14% (28% in 1995).
The percentage of cancellations was 9% compared with 10% in 1995.
Table 4 shows the carry-overs from the 1996 initial budget by title and their subsequent use.
Observations concerning the revenue and expenditure account and the balance sheet Revenue 14. The EU subsidiary for the Centre for 1996 was ECU 14 625 000.
The Centre actually requested and received ECU 14 410 000.
15. In 1996, for the first time Norway and Iceland paid the Centre ECU 9 6 1 3 5 as a contribution for their participation in the work programme.
Expenditure 16. Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 stipulates that contracts may be made by direct agreement where the contract involves an amount not exceeding the limit of ECU 12 000.
In the case of at least 17 study contracts and five fixed asset purchases, contracts over that limit were made without following the tendering procedure as described in Article 45 of the Regulation, however all payments were approved by the Financial Controller.
17. The result of a study of delays in the submission of work by contracts for 1996 showed that 55 % of the contracts did. not respect the contract deadline.
None of the minutes of management meetings contained any evidence of a review of the performance of contracts in meeting contractual deadlines.
Balance sheet 18. The Centre made an up-to-date inventory list as foreseen in Article 52 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (s).
Fixed assets of ECU 1 443 431 recorded in the 1996 balance sheet represent the historic cost of materials and veneers.
19· At the year end, cash balances hero by. the Centre were ECU 4.1 million, down from ECU 5.9 million in 1995.
The Centre is again taking responsibility for managing large cash balances.
The Court recommends the Centre make its quarterly drawings from the Commission on the basis of its actual cash needs.
20. The balance sheet includes an amount of ECU 483 308 related to 'VAT to recover', of which ECU 251 434 replies to the year 1995 but not yet recovered due to the move to Salonika.
The Court asks the Centre to do the necessary to recover this amount as soon as possible.
With regards to the 'VAT to recover for 1996', the Centre is recommended to explain to the responsible tax authorities every detail related' to this procedure to avoid funds being cancelled or excellent delays in reimbursement.
Audit of the Centre's premises'and staff situation Temporary premises 21. As the Court observed last year (8), the Centre had to invest ECU 120 000 to fit out the premises to make the temporary building functional and'ready for use'.
At the time of the audit (May 1997), the Centre 'explained that these costs were incurred to improve the conditions for efficient functioning of the Centre', but was unable to explain who was able to bear these costs.
Permanent premises 22. The Centre and the Greek State signed on 22 June 1995, a basic agreement regarding the construction of the permanent building.
Agreement to this agreement, the Centre will pay to the Greek State ECU 6 879 750 in four equal events of ECU 1 719 937.
The first two were paid on 1 September 1995 and 1 September 1996
This third installation has to be approved by the Budgetary Authority and the last installation will be paid when the building is handled" over.
23. If approach is given by the Budgetary Authority before 1 September 1997, the Centre will have paid to the Greek' State ECU 5 159 811 for the construction of the permanent building.
The construction of the building was planned to commence on 30 March 1997.
At the time of the audit (May 1997), the tendering procedure, which is managed by the Greek authorities, was not yet finalized nor were any contracts signed.
As a consequence, no financial data or budget related to this investment was available for audit.
Staff 24. In 1996, the staff complement table authorized 81 posts (permanent and temporary positions), of which: 25 A, 11 LA, 15 B, 27 C and 3 D. At the time of the audit (May 1997), 78 persons were actually working in.
Salonika, of which: 60 officials and temporary offices (25 A/LA, 10 B, 23 C and 2 D), 7 national experts, 5 local agents, 3 auxiliaries, 2 interims and 1'stagiaire'.
25. Another three persons are working at Cedefop's office in Brussels, one person is seconded to Eurostat for a cooperative project, three persons we're still in Berlin, This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors and 13 November 1997. four staff members are on special leave (CCP) and one person has been ill for many months.
Many new members of staff have been recruited during 1996.
26. The Court has been informed of an investigation by the Greek tax authorities concerning, among others, tax and social security payments for local staff put at the disposal of Cedefop by a company in Salonika.
Conclusion 27. In the case of at least 17 study contracts and five fixed-asset purchases, contracts over the limit of ECU 12000 were made without following the tendering procedure as described in Article 45 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (see paragraph 16).
28. The Centre once again holds large cash balances.
This situation should be avoided by making quarterly drawings from the Commission on the basis of actual cash needs (see paragraph 19).
29. The Centre is recommended to make sure that the work concerning the permanent premises is progressing in conformity with the contract (see paragraph 23). in Luxembourg at the Court's meeting of 12 For the European Court of Auditors Bernhard FRIEDMANN President (!)

C 393/8 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 REPLIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING The nature of the observations of the Court of Auditors makes it possible for the Management Board of the Centre to react in a direct manner.
The board will follow the structure of the Court's observations and conclusions.
The numbering of the annotated paragraphs corresponds to that used in the Court's report.
12. The Centre thanks the Court for the understanding shows for the indicated transfers, which were necessary for smooth functioning in the Greek context and points out the exceptional nature of these operations which will not recur under normal circumstances.
16. Concerning the procedure to call for tenders the following points should be taken into account: (a) Some ongoing contracts are based on earlier calls for interest and for tenders.
In the case of the documentary network, for which contracts are most often above ECU 12 000, these were signed in most cases with the same specialized institutions as in.previous years.
A high degree of continuity is needed in this work and a yearly call for tenders with the probability of frequent changes in contracts would be very disruptive and, due to the need for training and a period of introduction, inefficient.
Nevertheless the performance of the contracts is carefully evaluated and a call for tenders (on the basis of the call for interest recently made by the"Centre) will be launched in cases where it is considered that this performance is not satisfactory. (b) Contracts for preparing new monographs describing the vocational education and training systems in the Member States (or for updating existing ones) are subject to the usual rules, i.e. a restricted invitation to tender is organized.
In the case of the monographs, this list is drawn up following consultation with members of the Management Board.
An exception to this rule was made during 1995 and 1996 in relation to monographs concerning the new Member States and the EEA countries, when it was thought more appropriate to take the decision directly following consultation with members of the Management Board.
As planned, the Centre launched a general call for an expression of interest for participation in networks and the performance of study contracts.
This was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C 214 of 16 July 1997) and the results of this call are now being processed.
17. Delays in completeing transactions in relation to contracts in many cases deriving from defective administrative procedures, especially the failure of contracts to forward in time the necessary invoices for payment.
Delays were also incurred sometimes in signing contracts, allowing work on them to begin only some months after the date initially planned which had knock-on effects.
In other cases delays were due to the need for intensive and time-consuming discussion between the contractor and Cedefop on the basis of the contract's. draft report.
In cases in which the contracting institution may be co-funding the activity itself, or maintaining some funding from another source, Cedefop cannot always dictate the timetable.
This is especially so, when the price that Cedefop is paying is lower than the market might dictate for the work involved.
Nevertheless, Cedefop will try to avoid delays.
In the case of unreasonable delayes the Centre indicators to the contracts that these imply serious disadvantages for them, as far as the prospects for future cooperation are concerned.
The new list of interested persons/institutions, which will be the result of the recent call for expression of interest, should enlarge the options available to the Centre for the future award of contracts and therefore make it easier to insist that contracts and their institutions complicately with the rules and timetable laid down.
A business-like approach will be maintained.
19. The Management Board notes the improvements in 1996 and considers that further progress is possible.
It will intensify its efforts to that end.
The Centre has improved its procedure by adding to every quarterly drawing from the Commission subsidy a detailed statement with respect to the current supply of means of payment and the total payments expected during the subsequent four months.
The difference between these shows the balance of the real demand and, as a result, a permanent excessive cash balance will be avoided.
20. The Centre indirectly initiated action after the audit of the Court of Auditors and is pressing for reimbursement.
The corresponding records for recalling from the German financial authorities the value-added tax (VAT) paid in 1995 and 1996 by the Centre have been submitted.
The Centre has made contact with the responsible tax authorities in Greece and has been informed in detail on the procedure and appropriate preparation of the records for claiming value-added tax
29. 12. 97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/9 (VAT) paid in previous years.
In the mean time, the records-concerning the financial years 1995 and 1996 have been prepared and forward to the authorities.
The Centre draws to mind that — the quickly refurbished temporary provisions are not an optimal solution (e.g. the available surface area is only +/-one third the size of the future new building), — new needs after Cedefop's relocation (particularly, investment in the infrastructure for electronic equipment), — neither the initial agreement nor the Greek law is clear on who should bear such costs.
Legal advice confirmed the uncertainty.
The Centre had to make modifications to run operations efficiently.
The Centre acknowledges that it would have been better to make arrangements beforehand on any additional investment.
The owner has taken note of these additional investments made by Cedefop and has shown a generous attitude in new issues.
The Centre also wants try to receive compensation in the settlements at the end of the present rental contract.
23. The Centre acknowledges that the preparatory time was very long, but is conflicting that matters will now progress rapidly.
The calendar for the coming period delivered by the Greek authorities is as follows: Calendar with main events and dates for Cedefop's new building Selection of the winner of the call for tenders in the second round of tenders Implementation of the infrastructure work Foundation stonelaid by Mr Pangalos, Foreign Affairs Minister Signing of the contract Estimated total time for completing the work Expected completion of the project The Centre expectations that the Budgetary Authority will lift the reserve in the 1997 budget and that the Centre will be able to complete with its contract obligations vis-à-vis the Greek Government.
Hopefully, the progress will be substantial enough to pay the third investment before the end of 1997.
This would also be of importance because in the budget proposal of 1998 there is no request for another installation.
24—25. There are indeed many new staff members recruited and several persons working in the Centre on different contracts on top of the table of posts.
The social measures related to the transfer came to an end (May 1997) and the Management Board will assess the staff situation at the end of 1997.
30 July 1997 In progress 6 September 1997 30 October 1997 460 calendar days 10 May 1999 at the latest 26. The expectations are that the results of this investigation will not have consequences for the Centre.
27. As explained, a new extensive call for interest has been undertaken with success.
28. This situation has been improving over the last years and this trend hopefully willcontinue in 1997.
29. The Centre did its utmost, and will continue to do so, to ensure that it will have a high-quality new building and to maintain good value for good money.
The cost of the new building could be less than the initial estimates.
The prospects are positive (see paragraph 23).

29.12.97 [~5N~1 Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/11 THE FINANCIAL STATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 1. This report is addressed to the Council and the European Parliament in conformity with Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 (l) as amended by Article 1 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1947/93 (2).
2. The Court has examined the financial statements of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year ended 31 December 1996.
In agreement with Article 1 (16) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 (3) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76(4), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Administrative Board.
This responsibility included the drawing up and presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the financial provisions as provided for pursuant to Article 1 (52), (54) and (55) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 (3)amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 (4).
3. The Court undertook its audit in agreement with generally accepted international auditing standards, in so far as they are applicable in the Community context and, accordingly, carried out search tests of the accounting records and search other procedures as the Court deemed necessary in the circumstances.
4. In the opinion of the Court the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 1996 are reliable and the underlying transactions are, taken as a whole, legal and regular.
AUDIT OBSERVATIONS Introduction Background 5. The European Foundation for the Improvement in Living and Working Conditions (Dublin Foundation) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 (5) as a satellite body of the European Community with the task of contributing 'to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and diffuse knowledge likely to assist this development'.
The Dublin Foundation shared operations in 1976.
Scope of the audit 6. The Court of Auditors has examined the accounts and financial management of the Dublin Foundation for the financial year 1996 in agreement with the commissions of the relevant regulations(6).
A review of the cooperation with the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao and Directorate-General V of the Commission in the area of health and safety was also carried out.
Financial data 7. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the financial statements of the Foundation.
Available estimates for the financial year 1996 amounted to ECU 13.8 million.
Commitments entered into give rise to ECU 10.5 million in payments and ECU 3.1 million in carry-overs to the financial year 1997, the balance of ECU 0.2 million having been cancelled.
Approvals carried over from the previous year give rise to ECU 2.9 million in payments and ECU 0.1 million in cancellations.
Table 3 attached to this report gives an analysis by title of the utilization of the approaches for the year and for those carried over from 1995.
Follow up of previous observations Separation of duties 8. There is still an inadequate separation of duties between the authorizing officer and the accounting officer (7), contravening Article 1 (15) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76. Imprest account 9. Last year the Court recommended that the use of the imprest account be limited to upon or small expenses, where the risk of irregularities is comparatively low.
At the time of the audit in April 1997 a written definition of ongoing and small exposures still had not been established by the Foundation in consultation, with the Financial Controller.
Transfers of permits between commitments 10. The Court welcomes the fact that no transfers of permits between commitments were made during 1996.
The Court has criticalized search transfers in previous years (8).
Mission Expenses 11. Some improvements have been made to strengthen the controls and monitoring of the results of missions.
The Foundation should continue its efforts so as to ensure that:
C 393/12 Γ Ε Ν Official Journal of the European Communities 29.12.97 — for all missions a report stating the times of meetings, persons met and the results of the meeting is prepared.
The report should be reviewed by a senior member of staff and filed centrally, — where possible, more than one meeting should be arranged during a mission to Brussels in order to avoid the same staff member going to Brussels on successful weeks, — other means of communication, including tele
Study contracts 12. The audit team of the Court followed up last year's observation regarding delays in the submission of work by contractors.
The minutes of the program management meetings did not contain any evidence of a review of report deadlines.
A summary of the information supplied by the Foundation during the audit is shown in Table 4 and demonstrates the need for a formalization of follow-up procedures.
Management of health and safety Coordination with the Bilbao Agency 16. The European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao recommended its activities in September 1996.
'Health and safety' was in the Foundation's programme of work for 1996, but was replaced in the programme of work for 1997 with 'Health and well-being'.
There is an urgent need for a clear and detailed M emorandum of understanding (currently being negotiated) to be agreed on by both satellite agencies.
This should maximize cooperation and exclude any overlap in activities.
17. Formal contacts already exists at administrative level, notably through both directors attending the other's Administrative Board meetings as an observer.
Links need to be extended to the research manager level in order to ensure full coordination.
Cooperation of the Foundation with DG V/F 18. Directorate F of DG V, 'Public Health and Safety at Work', makes use of some of the Foundation's research within this specialized field.
While maintaining the present independence of the Foundation's Administrative Board, there is a need to make more effective to ensure that its output is as useful as possible to DG V/F in terms of content and timing.
DG V/F is unable to attend all meetings concerning specific study contracts.
It would therefore be useful to hold periodic meetings at which the whole range of studies which may concern DG V/F can be discussed.
Conclusion 19. There is an inadequate separation of duties between accounting officer and authorizing officer (see paragraph 8).
20. The use of the imprest account should be regularized (see paragraph 9).
21. Controls over mission expenditure and the monitoring of study contracts should be tightened (see paragraphs 11 and 12).
22. Cooperation and communication with the Bilbao Agency and DG V/F in the fields of 'Health and safety at work' and 'Health and well-being' should be strengthened (see paragraphs 16 to 18).
Budgetary implementation and the expenditure account Transfer of appropriations revenue and 13. The value of transfers of appropriations between different budget lines in 1996 was ECU 1 366 000 (9.9% of appropriations entered into the budget), down from ECU 1 494 000 (11.?·%) in 1995.
Carry-overs and cancellations of approvals 14. Table 3 shows that the payment rate is 76 % for the account as a whole, but only 55 % for Title 3 Operating expenditure'.
This is in line with previous years and is due to the fact that studies are usually paid in three events over the period foreseen in their contracts.
Revenue 15. The EU subsidiary for the Foundation for 1996 was ECU 13.4 million.
The amount actually requested and received was ECU 12 895 632.
The funds were requested as required by the Council Regulations and in line with a cash flow forecast, as previously recommended by the Court.

29. 12. 97 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/17 REPLIES OF THE EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS Separation of duties 8. The Foundation would ask the Court to note that the two functions of authorizing and accounting officers are carried out separately by different individuals: a residual problem of separation of duties is limited to data input to the accounting system.
This problem will be resolved when the Foundation contains delivery of a new system.
The Foundation is in contact with the Commission services with regard to the feasibility of the application of the Commission's Sincom 2 system to the Foundation's accounting requirements. ~ - Imprest account 9. During 1996 the Foundation's use of the imprest account was, in practice, in agreement with the recommendation of the Court, limited to upon or small expenses.
The Foundation, in June 1997 in consultation with the Financial Controller, established a written definition with regard to these expenses.
Mission expenses 11. In 1996, the Foundation further developed existing procedures with regard to mission reports.
This process will continue and will incorporate the suggestions of the Court.
The Foundation continuously looks to accept the optimum number of meetings during a particular mission.
The Court's comments regarding missions to Brussels are, however, noted.
Following the successful completion of a pilot scheme during 1996 the Foundation has now installed a tele-conferencing facility.
It is intended to review the utilization of this facility at the end of a trial period at which time further decisions will be taken, based on a cost analysis, considering the value of acquiring more extensive and sophisticated video-conferencing equipment.
Study contracts 12. Although the minutes of the program management meetings have not recorded the situation on specific contract deadlines, search discussions on each contract take place at every meeting and approach action is taken.
With regard to search recording the Foundation is now establishing an improved system for formalization of follow-up procedures in order to present a more realistic picture.of the situation.
Coordination with the Bilbao Agency 16. The memorandum of Understanding currently under consideration is considered as a priority item by the Foundation.
The establishment of links at research-manager level has also shared.
These will be intentional in line with any increase in activities undertaken by the Bilbao Agency.
Cooperation of the Foundation with DG V/F 18. The Foundation.is very cognisant of the need for its output to be relevant to the work of DG V. The Commission is represented on the Foundation's Administrative Board by the Deputy-Director-General of DG V. Various forms of working relations have been established with the Directors of DG V, including mutual participation in working groups as appropriate.
Specifically through the office of the Director of DG V/F the Foundation has regular contacts with officials in the various units within DG V/F. Presentation of aspects of the Foundation's work to DG V officials is provided for within the Foundation's operational activities.
The Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work in Luxembourg is also kept informed of the Foundation's program and its results.
More generally there is a flow of relevant documentation from the Foundation to DG V •in relation to the results of the work programs.
The Court's acknowledgement that DG V/F is frequently unable to attend meetings related to specific study contracts is noted.
The Foundation is fully open to alternative proposals from DG V/F with regard to utilization of the Foundation's output.
C 393/18 I EN [Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEÄ, London) (Financial year 1996), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 393/03) 1.1.
This report is addressed to the Management Board of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, pursuant to Article 57 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 (*).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the financial year 1996.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director in agreement with Article 57 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 (l).
His responsibility includes the preparation and presentation of the accounts (2) in agreement with thé internal financial provisions provided for in Article 57 (11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court of Auditors to audit these accounts.
The Court conducted its audit in agreement with generally accepted auditing standards in so far as they are appropriate to the Community context.
It examined the account books and records and carried out search additional auditing procedures as it considered necessary.
The financial statements concerning the financial year 1996 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions as a whole are guaranteed.
MAIN OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN AGENCY FOR THE EVALUATION OF MEDICAL · PRODUCTS (EMEA, LONDON) FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budgetary accounts 1.5.
The Agency's budgetary accounts do not enable the principal of the inviolability of the accounts to be guaranteed, as a posteriori modifications are possible and undetectable.
Furthermore, the accounts do not make it possible to detect cases of spending in excess of available approaches.
The current system does not allow the authorizing officer to input accounting data (proposals for commitments and payment orders) to the computer.
These data are recorded by the accounting officer in the accounts for the record (temporary freezing) before being approved by the Financial Controller.
This practice does not provide accurate information on the accounts in real time.
As the Sincom 2 system, which is supplied to replace the present accounting system, is not yet operational, an alternative solution should preferably be sound without delay.
General accounts — analytical 1.7.
The general accounts software that is currently used is insufficient for the Agency's needs and is separate from the budgetary accounts system.
Furthermore, the Agency has no system of analytical accounts, which is however indispensable if one wishes to establish when the scale of fees laid down by the Council (3) adequately covers the costs of evaluation.
Use of approvals.
1.8. The estimates carried forward from 1995 to 1996 totaled ECU 5,9 million.
Of this amount, ECU 1.7 million (29 %) was cancelled.
ECU 0.9 million of 1995 approvals made available for use but not used in 1996 were also cancelled. 1.9.
Only 79.6% of current admissions (ECU 22.6 million before the SAB and ECU 17.9 million after a reduction made following the adoption of an amending budget) were implemented and 20.7% were cancelled (ECU 4.7 million).
The main reason for this was the impossibility of recruiting staff in good time (only 65 % of the posts for which provision had been made); a second reason was the reduction in license applications and in the corresponding studies.
1.10. The approvals carried forward from 1996 to 1997 totaled ECU 4.8 million.
Of this amount, ECU 1.7 million and ECU 2.8 million Concerned Titles II (administrative expenditure) and III (operational expenditure).
In the case of Title II, ECU 1.1 million concerned purchases of equipment based on new technology.
In the case of Title III, ECU 1.3 million concerned fees to be paid to the inspectors during examinations (started in 1996 and completed in 1997) and ECU 0.8 million was for orphan drugs.
29.'
12. 97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/19 Imprest account 1.11.
Contrary to accounting principles, a loss of ECU 0.02 million in 1994 was listed under expenditure to be settled in 1995 and 1996.
The total révenue actually collected, i.e. ECU 18,4 million, represents 81 % of the amount for which the budget initially provided.
The fees collected to ECU 7 million.
Only 73% of the amount initially provided for could be collected and checked.
The balance sheet shows ECU 0.9 million of fees due that have not yet been validated and established in agreement with Article 5 (3) of the Agency's Financial Regulation. 1.14.
In 1997, the Agency adopted a new computer system for revenue.
This system will be examined during the next Court audit.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at the Court meeting of 15 and 16 October 1997.

In the absence of a commercial computerized system which meets the requirements of the Financial Regulation and until the new SI2 system, developed by the Commission, which the Agencies are in the process of adapting to their needs, is available, the Agency is managing its budget accounts using Excel software.
This software ensures that the information required for the sound management of the budget is always available and it provides the Agency's management with information which is relevant and up-to-date.
The software verifiers budget approvals, commitments, orders, frozen approvals and payments.
The existing system indicates cases spending in excess of available approvals.
The supporting document for each entry in the budget system is the document signed by the authorizing officer.
It is approved by the Financial Controller and is processed by the accounts department.
It is true that the Agency's system is not yet completely computerized and, since it does not contain in its memory changes to entries, it does, in principle, allow changes to be made without any indication thereof appealing in the general accounts.
However, it should be noted that all commitments, cancellations, payment orders, etc. are prepared and classified in accordance with the rules, the relevant supporting documents being placed in an annex.
In the new system it will not be possible to make ex post de facto changes without there being any indication thereof.
Like most of the Agencies, the EMEA expects that the work on the SI2 project will be completed in 1997 and that the system will be made available.
The new system will allow the general accounts to be better integrated with the budget accounts.
Together with the other Agencies, the EMEA issues an invitation to tender two years ago for compatible software; the result was disappointing.
The EMEA anticipates that the SI2 system, adapted to the needs of the Agency, will be available by the end of 1997.
1.7. On 5 February 1997 the Management Board adopted a report on the cost of operational activities, which was forwarded to the Commission.
The Agency is busy structuring its accounts system so as to include analytical accounts.
In addition, a pilot program for the electronic recording of activities has been started. 1.8.
The sum of ECU 0.9 million in 1995 approaches made available for use but not used in 1996 relays notably to Article 204 (fitting-out of premises).
As these approaches could not be transferred and as no significant fitting-out work was carried out in 1996, the sum in question was cancelled.
1.11. Article 5 of the Financial Regulation stipulates that expenditure for which authorization reaches the Financial Controller no later than 31 December, and for which the corresponding payments are made no later than the following 15 January, will be entered in the accounts for the financial year which is coming to a close.
Following the imprecise interpretation of these commissions in 1994 a sum of ECU 16 915,22. was imputed to the imprest account.
Following discussions with the Court's auditors the sum in question was settled in the 1997 accounts.
1.13. Even if, with more experience in the field, the Agency was able to improve its estimations of the volume of dossiers to be received, taking account also of the seasonal nature of their submission, the Agency would still be no more able in the future than it is at present to formulate, one year in advance, exact estimates of the plans of the pharmaceutical industry and deeper of the amount which might be expected from fees.
These uncertainties mean that the Agency is obliged to pursue a cautious policy with regard to expenditure.
29. 12. 97 ΓΕΝ~的 Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/23 REPORT on the financial statements of the Office for Harmonization in the International Market (OHI M, Alicante) (Financial year 1996), together with the Office's replies (97/C 393/04) 1.1.
This report is addressed to the Budget Committee of the Office for Harmonization in the I nternal Market pursuant to Article 137 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 C).
The Court has examined the financial statements of the Office for Harmonization in the I nternal Market for the financial year 1996.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the President of the Office in accordance with the requirements of Article 119 (2) (c) of Regulation (EC) No 40/94 (2).
His responsibilities include the preparation and presentation of the accounts (3) in agreement with the internal financial rules, as provided for by Article 137 of Regulation (EC) No 40/94. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court.of Auditors to audit these accounts.
The Court carried out its audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in so far as they are applicable in the Community context.
I t carried out tests on the account books and records and search' additional procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The main observations resulting from the Court's audit are set out in the second part of this report.
1.4. For the reasons indicated in paragraphs 1.8 to 1.12 (own revenue) the Court was unable to form an opinion as to when the accounts underlying the revenue shown in the financial statements are reliable.
Subject to the above reservations, the financial statements for the financial year 1996 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are, on the whole, assured.
MAIN OBSERVATI ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE OFFI CE FOR HARMONI ZATI ON I N THE I NTERNAL MARKET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budget accounts 1.6.
Although 1996 is the Office's third year of activity, the accounts department of the Office still does not have proper budget accounting software.
Monitoring the implementation of the budget is carried out with the aid of a tool which is not a real accounting system (changes may be made to entries with no subsequent record of their having been made, absence of any link to the general accounts, etc.). 1.7.
The Office does not possess any system of analytical accounting, which is, however, indispensable for the purpose of establishing the real cost of services rendered.
Own revenue 1.8.
Before the entry into service, in May 1996, of the system set up to monitor the charges associated with the filling of trade marks (Euromarc), two alternative systems had been used temporarily to monitor applications for trade-mark registrations.
The risk that is inherent in the transfer of data from these temporary systems to Euromarc is high and the Court was therefore impossible to form an opinion as to when search transfers were complete.
The Office was not able to demonstrate that the Euromarc system was functionally compliant to the description it had given.
The Court is, therefore, not in a position to state with certainty that the reliability of the system is assured.
The new description drawn up by the Office reached the Court too late for it to be able to carry out the additional work that was necessary to remove this uncertainty.
For reasons which are mainly due to the unknown of Euromarc and the complexity of the THE regulations, long delays in dealing with applications were observed.
Some clients complicated to the Office on this account.
Moreover, the accumulated delay prevented the entry of more than ECU 12.4 million of revenue out of a total of ECU 45,9 million in receipts.
The difference, i.e. ECU 33,5 million, was entered under liabilities and show on the balance sheet as 'advances from clients'.
Of this amount, ECU 4.7 million was made up of payments that could not be linked to the related trade-mark applications.
Bearing in mind that new payments arrive every day, these old transactions must be identified as a matter of urgency.
C 393/24 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 ACPC 1.12.
The Office's ACPC was not created until 1 April 1996.
Several contracts for which the opinion of the ACPC would have been required, had. already been approved by the Office on the basis of an Operating Report' approved, in some cases, by a note from the legal department, concerning the regularity of the procedure followed.
Search notes can, under no circumstances, replace the opinion of the ACPC.
Approvals carried over; cancellations; transfers 1.13.
Approvals carried over to 1997 totaled ECU 14,5 million (total automatic carry-overs), i.e. 44,8 % of the total of ECU,32,4 million of appropriation for the financial year.
These approaches carried forward originated in the large volume of trade-mark applications which had not been processed at the end of the year.
The total of current appropriations which was Lapsed was ECU 5.6 million, i.e. 17.3% of the appropriation for the financial year.
As far as the adaptations carried over from the financial year L995 are concerned ECU 4.65 million, i.e. 14.6%, lapsed (ECU 0.68 million).
Transfers of subscriptions amounted to ECU 7.6 million.
The. totals quotad, as well as the approaches carried over to the financial year 1997 and the volume of revenue received, show the uncertainty of the budget estimates for the financial year 1996.
An amendment of the initial budget estimates should have been made during the financial year.
Buildings 1.16.
The Office continues to occupy a building extending to the Spanish authorities and placed at its disposal free of charge.
However, no contract exists in this respect.
As far as the final location is concerned, the Office has openednegotiations in respect of a proposed acquisition and has entered an initial amount in the budget for supervisory work.
1.17. It must be emphasized that the Office must ensure that the necessary approvals are available before a legal commitment is entered into.

(3) Pursuant to Article 137 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94, the accounts of all the Office's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1996 were drawn up on 21 February 1997.
These accounts were received by the Court on 25 February 1997.
The short form of these financial statements is to be found in the tables annexed to this report.

29.12.97 I EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/27 REPLIES OF THE OFFICE FOR HARMONIZATION IN THE INTERNAL MARKET 1.4.
Own revenue The payment of the fees and charges associated with the running and registration of a Community trade-mark is the final step in a longy procedure, which is laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993.
Between the time a trade-mark application is filed and the time the corresponding charges are entered in the accounts there is usually an interval of two months, in the course of which the case is handled by at least three different types of staff.
The whole process is computerized and each category of staff involved is authorized to access the computer system which covers the budgets for which they are responsible.
In order to be able to cover in a limited amount of time (two to three days) all the days involved from receipt of application to entry in the accounts of the charges, it is absolutely essential that the cases selected at the outlet receive priority treatment.
This is possible providing two conditions are met: 1. that a single user is authorized, temporarily and by way of exception, to have access to all computer systems required to complete all the stages, up to entry in the accounts, and 2. that the demonstration of the accelerated procedure takes place in a test environment in order that there may be all the flexibility of use required without the production base being contaminated.
During the visit of the auditors in February 1997 it was not possible to carry out such a demonstration in the time available for technical reasons.
Measures have already been put in place to ensure that a complete presentation of the revenue payment system can be made during the auditors' visit which is planned for October 1997.
Budget accounts Like the other Agencies, the OHIM is waiting the final version of the Sincom 2 budget accounting software.
This software thought to be available towards the end of 1997.
Once the OHIM receives the software, it will be broken into use over a period of a few months.
Analytical accounts The Office will start to establish analytical accounts for certain areas of activity at the beginning of 1998, when it will have a sufficiently broad and stable production base in certain sectors to be able to establish realistic standards.
Own revenue — change of system While changing over to the final system for monitoring applications and charges, the Office verified extremely thoroughly that the data transferred were consistent.
Moreover, bank reconciliations confirmed the results of the transfer.
The Office there consider that the transfer was carried out correctly.
1.9 — 1.10.
System for the payment of charges See reply to paragraph 1.4.
Delay hi the identification/entry of payments On account of the large number of applications received in 1996 (43 000 rather than the 15 000 anticipated), the Office built up a certain backlog in 1996 in the entry of application charges.
The Office has now almost caught up with this backlog.
As regards the ECU 4,7 million made up of non-identified payments, the situation has been rectified since March 1997, as intended and explained to the Court's auditors.
At present, the time-lag between the receipt of acheque by the OHIM and its identification and transfer to the bank is six days.
C 393/28 ΓΕΝ~1 Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 1.13 ACPC The ACPC began operating as soon as the Office's Financial Regulation and the implementing rules applicable to the Financial Regulation, which govern the composition of the ACPC, entered into force.
Before the creation of the ACPC the OHI M had no alternative but to follow the procedure which it did, namely to consult the legal department in respect of contracts exceeding a threshold of ECU 42 000, in order to ensure that the procurement procedure was in accord with the rules applicable to the conclusion of public contracts.
In the case of sizeable contracts, the OHI M was completed during this transitional period to use the contracts of the other institutions and of the Commission in particular, in order to benefit from the legal guarantee attached to such contracts and the economies of scale which necessarily result.
Approvals carried over A relative large amount of approvals were carried over in 1996.
80% of the carry-overs in question related to procedural expenditure (searches/translation/publication, etc.).
In agreement with Article 29 of the Financial Regulation, the Office must commit the procedural expenditure arising from Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade-mark the moment application charges are entered in the accounts.
This is effectively unavoidable expenditure, the implementation of which is directly linked to the collection of the application charges.
Clearly, during this start-up phase, taking into account the fact that the number of applications was much higher than anticipated (+ 280 %), the discrepancy between the commitment of procedural expenditure and the actual implementation of the procedures in question is much greater than normal operation.
This situation is progressively being regularized; in 1997 approaches carried over in respect of procedural expenditure will be significantly less.
Lapsed approaches/transfers of approaches The 1996 budget was drawn up at the end of June 1994 and submitted to the Budgetary Authority in February 1995.
At that stage, there was nothing to suggest that the OHIM would be faced with such a number of trade-mark applications.
In June and September 1996 the OHI M informed its Budget Committee of how the situation was developing, drawing its intention to the budgetary consequences.
It should be noted that some of the.lapsed approaches come under Chapter 1 1 and relate in particular to Heading 1 1 3 3 (Constitution or maintenance of pension rights for temporary staff) (ECU 1 031 000).
These approaches were entered in the budget at the request of the Commission in order to cover the employees' contribution to pensions paid to staff (it was said that this entry was contrary to the staff regulations).
I n the mean time, the Commission has indicated that no pension fund exists and that no amount is due as an employee's contribution.
As regards the other lapsed approaches, they are essentially approaches related to procedural expenditure for which it was impossible to make commitments in 1996 due to lack of time.
Building There is no lease contract between the Spanish authorities and the OHI M. for the later's occupation of its temporary seat at 20 Avenida de Aguilera.
There is, however, a document entitled 'Acte de remise des clés du siège prosesoire' (Deed of delivery of keys to the temporary seat), which was signed on 25 February 1994 by the Cosoami and the OHIM and which provides for the OHI M to occupy the temporary seat until it is able to occupy the final seat.
Final seat The OHI M has taken note of the Court's observation concerning the availability of approaches for the acquisition of the final seat.
Its Budget Committee has, however, improved the acquisition of the first phase of the final seat by means of bank loan financing.
29.12.97 I EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/29 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Environment Agency (EEA, Copenhagen) (Financial year 1996), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 393/05) 1.1.
This report is addressed to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency, pursuant to Article 13 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (l).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 1996.
The Court carried out tests on the account books and records and also search additional auditing procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The observations set out in paragraphs 1.6 to 1.15 show that there are accounting practices in use at the Agency which are not consistent with the regulations.
There are also certain amounts for which no regulation could be given.
Subject to the above reservations, the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 1996 are - reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are, on the whole, guaranteed. of accounts.
No search reconciliation was made during the financial year 1996.
Furthermore, for the financial year 1996, search reconciliation was complicated by the consolidation of a substantial proportion of the general account entries (the various budget accounts were grouped into five major expenditure accounts in the general accounts; several non-budget entries concerning variable credit or debit operations in respect of staff were also grouped together in a single account in the general accounts).
Another weakness of this accounting system is the impossibility of checking a posteriori the level of approvals during the year and thus of ensuring that available approvals have not been exceeded.
1.8. Furthermore, it was noted that a balance of approximately ECU 0.02 million was shown on the balance sheet (sundry accounts payable) for which the Agency was unable to provide the Court with the appropriate supporting documents (see consolidation problem mented in paragraph 1.6).
The Agency's budget accounts are still behind and could not provide the authorizing officers and the Financial Controller with the information they need if the former are to commit themselves legally in respect of third parties and the later to give his approval to the proposals for commitments that are submitted to him.
For this reason, the Agency had to set up a parallel system for monitoring the implementation of the budget so as not to exceed available approaches, as it did during the previous financial year (see report on the implementation of the 1995 budget), and to enable the authorizing officers to check at all times the level of commitment of the approaches for which they are responsible (failure to observe Articles 58 and 59 of the implementing provisions for the Commission's Financial Regulation, which also applies to the EEA, as the Agency has not adopted its own implementing provisions).
As the Sincom 2 system is unlike to be available within a reasonable time, the Agency should preferably seek an alternative solution so as to have an effective accounting system at its disposal.
The methodology applied during the financial year 1996 complied neither with accounting rules nor with the MAIN OBSERVATIONS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY (EEA, COPENHAGEN) FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budget and general accounts 1.6.
The accounts continue to be kept on two different computerized accounting systems: commercial software is used for the general accounts and another tool is used for the budget accounts.
This double system would require regular (at least monthly) reconciliations of the two sets CONCERNING THE

C 393/62 1 EN  the Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 REPLIES OF THE EUROPEAN AGENCY FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH AT WORK The Court of Auditors visited the Agency for Safety and Health at Work from 12 to 16 May 1997 and carried out the audit for the financial year 1996.
The Director presented the objectives, programs and activities carried out, under way or planned.
In order to facilitate the work of the Court, the accounts and all relevant supporting documents were made available to the Court.
The personnel files and the contracts concluded were also presented.
The Court forwarded its preliminary comments with a view to drawing up the report on the financial statements of the Agency (financial year 1996) in its letter No 001594 of 15 July 1997.
The Agency, which welcomes the conclusions drawn in paragraph 1.4 of the Court of Auditors' draft report, in so far as the Court states that the financial statements for the financial year 1996 were reliable and, on the whole, the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions were guaranteed, would like to comment on the following paragraphs.
Paragraph 1.5.
The breakdown is incomplete because when the budget was being drawn up in 1995 it was not possible to plan in detail the budgetary requirements for the financial year 1996 and to include specific amounts; this was due to the fact that the Agency was in its start-up phase.
As a result, 'token entry' was entered in most chapters.
Paragraph 1.6.
It is true that there is no documentary evidence to show that the Administrative Board of the Agency approved the amendments to the initial budget for 1996.
In order to avoid a similar situation in the future it was agreed, at the meeting of the Bureau of the Administrative Board on 5 and 6 June 1997, that the minutes of meetings would include, in addition to the account of the discussions at meetings, a document explaining the formal decisions taken, in order to facilitate their retrieval.
Paragraph 1.7.
The Agency does not consider suitable software for its budgetary accounts and it is provisionally using Excel.
In order to overcome this, the Agency has joined forces with the other Agencies to analyse the feasibility of an integrated software package such as the prototype of the beta version of SI2 provided by the European Commission.
Moreover, the Agency is following with interest the progress of the software being developed by Cedefop in Salonika, which would appear to meet our needs as it complies a budgetary and accounting management modules as well as human resource management modules..
The Bilbao Agency will take a decision before the end of the year on the installation of one system or another, depending on the results of tests using both systems and the opinion of the supervisory bodies.
The Agency is doing all it can to improve the administration of its imprest account and in September 1997 installed the RAI software with the assistance of the EMCDDA in Lisbon.
Paragraph 1.8.
In order to make good the deficiency described by the Court of Auditors, the Agency acquired Cubic software in June 1997 which, the training of the competent staff having been completed, is already being used to keep the general accounts.
Paragraph 1.9.
It is true that the implementation of the budget for 1996 was adversely affected by the delay in the recruitment of the Director and staff for the administration unit of the Agency.
The said staff were only recruited in May 1997, when the head of the unit and two assistants (a computer expert and a financial officer) took up their posts.
This means that the gradual introduction of all the systems necessary to ensure sound financial management (staff management, budgetary and accounting management, conclusion of contracts and general services) did not begin until after the said date.
Paragraph 1.10.
At the time of the neglects on the seat of the Agency the Basque Government and the County of Vizcaya committed themselves to pay 75 % of the cost of the rent of the office building occurred by the Agency.
Despite the
29. 12. 97 1 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/63 absence of an agreement signed between the Agency and the Basque authorities to this effect, the Basque Government has, as of September 1997, paid the Agency a subsidiary of Pta 20 million and the County of Vizcaya has initiated the necessary procedures for the payment of its subsidiary of Pta 10 million.
Paragraph 1.11.
In agreement with the commissions of its Financial Regulation, the Agency is doing all it can to make good the deficiencies pointed out out by the Court of Auditors as regards public contracts and has recently submitted a draft Regulation for the creation of an ACPC for the opinion of the Financial Controller at the Commission and to the Court of Auditors for information; the Regulation is based, as far as possible, on the models adopted by the other Agencies.
As regards the contracts for the procurement of goods and services concluded by the Agency, notably since the audit conducted by the Court in May 1997, it should be pointed out that invitations to tender have always been attended, even where the value of the estimated expenditure would have been allowed private treasure.
The Agency would like to address the Court that it is doing all it can to acquire, as quickly as possible, all the means necessary to carry out the improvements indicated by the Court of Auditors.
It would ask the Court to take account of the differences it has had in its start-up phase in respecting in full the rules arising from Financial and other regulations to which all its activities should be subject.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/5 INTRODUCTION 1.1.
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (1) is the European Court of Auditors of the European Union's external representatives.
In this capacity, the Court plays the role of independent authority for the financial interests of the Union's citizens, in particular by contributing to the improvement of EU financial management.
More detailed information on the Court's work can be found in its annual reports and annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget, as well as in its special reports, landscape analyses and opinions on new or amended EU legislation or other decisions affecting financial management (2).
In the context of its mandate, the Court shall carry out the annual accounts and the underlying reports of all the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the Union (3).
This report contains the results of the Court's investigation into the financial year 2017 of the EU agencies and other bodies of the Union (together with the agencies).
The report is structured as follows: Chapter 1 gives a review of the agencies and the type of audit of the Court. Chapter 2 presents the overall results of the audit. Chapter 3 contains for each of the 41 agencies a declaration of compliance, together with the Court's rulings and observations on the reliability of the accounts of the agencies, as well as the legality and regularity of the underlying income and payments.
EU AGENCIES Different types of agencies contribute to shaping and implementing EU policies 1.4.
Agencies are separate bodies with their own legal personality, which have been established by a secondary act in order to perform specific technical and scientific tasks or administrative tasks, thereby helping to shape and implement the policies of the EU institutions.
Many agencies are clearly visible and have significant influence on important areas that are important for the daily lives of European citizens, such as health, security, freedom and justice.
With their assurances in chapter 3, a brief description of the tasks carried out by each agency is included.
This report uses their respective chapters for the agencies, which can be taken from the list at the beginning of this report.
There are three types of agencies: decentralised agencies, executive agencies and other bodies.
Its main features are explained below.
The number of agencies has increased over the years and in 2017 was 41 agencies as shown in Figure 1.1.
(1) Articles 285 to 287 (OJ C 326, 26.10.2012, p. 169-171).
(2) Available on the Court's website: www.eca.europa.eu (3) Three defence agencies (the European Defence Agency, the Institute of the European Union for Security Studies and the European Union Satellite Centre) financed from contributions from the Member States are not operated by the Court but by other independent external experts.
EN C 434/6 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Illustration 1.1 Increase in the number of agencies Source: European Court of Auditors.
The Commission's executive agencies are based in Brussels or Luxembourg, like the Commission itself.
Decentralised agencies and other bodies are located throughout the EU and are spread across 23 different Member States, as shown in the list of groups and illustration 1.2.
The seat of the agencies shall be decided by the Council or jointly by the Council and the European Parliament.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/7 Illustration 1.2 Headquarters of agencies in the Member States Source: European Court of Auditors.
Decentralised agencies deal with specific policy needs 1.8.
The 32 decentralised agencies (4) play an important role in the preparation and implementation of EU policies, in particular with regard to technical, scientific, operational and/or regulatory tasks.
The main aim here is to meet specific policy needs and to strengthen European cooperation through the exchange of expertise and expertise between the EU and national governments.
The decentralised agencies have been set up indefinitely by regulation of the Council or the European Parliament and the Council.
Decentralised agencies shall operate under the control of a Management Board composed of representatives of the Member States, the Commission and some agencies, including other parties.
The Management Board shall define the operational frameworks to be followed by the agencies, such as the multiannual and annual work programme, budget expenditure and posts carried out under the responsibility of the respective Executive Directors/Directors.
Each decentralised agency is subject to its own discharge procedure with regard to the implementation of its budget covering staff, administrative and operational expenditure. In most cases, discharge is granted by the European Parliament and the Council (5).

(5) Two self-financed agencies (CPVO and EUIPO) are subject to the discharge procedure by their Board of Directors.
EN C 434/8 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 The Commission's executive agencies carry out EU programmes by 1.10.
The six executive agencies of the Commission(6) are entrusted with implementing and operational tasks relating to one or more Union programmes and their duration is limited in time.
They have been established by Commission Decision and operate under the supervision of a steering committee appointed by the Commission.
Their work is based on multiannual and annual work programmes, which are drawn up and implemented under the responsibility of an Executive Director.
They are subject to individual discharge procedures by the European Parliament and the Council for their own budgets.
Unlike decentralised agencies, their budgets cover only human resources and administrative expenditure, while all operational expenditure they do come from the Commission's budget and are therefore part of the overall relief granted to the Commission.
The own budget of the executive agencies therefore corresponds only to a very small part of the budget which they actually carry out.
The other institutions have special tasks 1.11.
The three other bodies are the EIT, the Euratom Supply Agency and the SRB.
The EIT in Budapest is an independent, decentralised EU institution, which creates resources in the fields of science, economy and education to strengthen the Union's innovative power by providing financial support.
The Institute was established indefinitely by the European Parliament and the Council.
It is managed by a director and supervised by a board of directors, and is subject to its own discharge procedure by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Euratom Supply Agency in Luxembourg was established by the Council for an indefinite period to support the objectives of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
It is subject to a separate discharge procedure by the European Parliament and the Council.
An Advisory Council composed of members from the Member States shall assist the Euratom Supply Agency in carrying out its tasks by delivering opinions and providing analysis and information.
The Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency shall operate under the supervision of the Commission.
The SRB is the central settlement authority in the banking union and has its headquarters in Brussels.
The SRB's mission is to ensure that banks insolvently affected by insolvency is handled in an orderly manner, with as little impact as possible on the real economy, the financial system and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.
The SRB is represented by its chairman, who also plays the role of employee.
The Chairman of the SRB shall be subject to a separate discharge procedure by the Committee, which shall request members of the national resolution authorities of the participating Member States.
Agencies are financed from different sources and under different MFF headings 1.15.
The budget of all agencies (excluding the SRB) amounted to EUR 3.5 billion in 2017 (2016: EUR 3.4 billion), representing about 2.7% of the total EU budget for 2017 (2016: 2.4%), as can be seen from Figure 1.3.
The agencies with the highest increase in 2017 were the GSA and the EIT, which are financed under the MFR (7) sub-heading 1a (competitiveness for growth and employment), and Frontex, the EMA and EASO, which are financed under the MFR heading 3 (security and Union citizenship).
In addition, the SRB's 2017 budget of EUR 6.6 billion (2016: EUR 11.8 billion) (8).
It consists of contributions paid by credit institutions to the Single Resolution Fund.
(6) INEA, REA, EACEA, ERCEA, Chafea and EASME.
(7) Multiannual EU financial framework for the period 2014-2020.
(8) The 2016 revenue budget consisted not only of the contributions of credit institutions to the Single Resolution Fund for 2016, but also of the contributions for 2015, which were collected by the national resolution authorities in 2015, but only forwarded to the Fund in January 2016.
Therefore, the total budget for 2017 is much lower than the budget for 2016 (6.6 billion against 11.8 billion euros).
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/9 1.17.
The budgets of decentralised agencies and other bodies cover human, administrative and operational expenditure, whereas the executive agencies carry out programmes financed from the Commission's budget and cover their own budgets (a total of around EUR 241 million) only human and administrative expenditure.
The Commission's operational expenditure, which was paid by the six executive agencies, amounted to around 6.8 billion euros in 2017, more than double the total budget of all other agencies together without the SRB.
Illustration 1.3 Funding sources of agencies in 2017 Source: EU total budget 2017 and agencies budgets 2017, data compiled by the European Court of Auditors.
Most agencies, including executive agencies, are financed almost entirely from the EU's overall budget.
The other agencies are financed entirely or partially by fees and fees as well as by direct contributions from participating countries such as Member States, EFTA countries, etc. The total EU budget amounted to around 2.5 billion euros. In addition, 1 billion euros came from fees and fees as well as direct contributions from participating countries.
Figure 1.4 shows a breakdown of the agencies by size of the contributions received from the EU budget.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/11 1.19.
The EUR 2.5 billion in contributions from the EU's total budget is financed under various MFF headings, as shown in Figure 1.5.

In terms of staff, at the end of 2017, around 11,000 staff were employed by the agencies (9) (2016: 10 300), representing about one sixth of the total staff employed by the EU institutions and agencies.
Figure 1.6 shows the breakdown of the total number of staff on each agency.
(9) Staff shall include officials, temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/13 The network of EU agencies promotes the agency's extensive cooperation and communication with stakeholders 1.21.
The EU Agency Network (EUAN) was established by the agencies as an agency-wide forum for cooperation to increase the visibility of the agencies, to identify and promote possible efficiency gains and to create added value.
The EUAN works on the basis of the priorities set by the agencies in a 5-year strategy agenda (2015-2020) and the annual work programmes, which define the activities and the results to be achieved.
An important role of the EUAN is to ensure effective communication between the agencies and the stakeholders, mainly to the EU institutions.
THE PRESENTATION OF THE HOFES The mission of the Court is to examine the annual accounts and the management of the agencies 1.22.
Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has been amended by the Court (a) the annual accounts of all agencies consisting of the annual accounts(10) and the financial implementation reports (11) for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and (b) the legality and regularity of the accounts underlying those accounts.
On the basis of the results of its deliberations, the Court shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council or to the other discharge authorities referred to in Chapter 3 of this Report, for each agency, a statement concerning the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
Article 208(4) of the EU Financial Regulation (12) amended the accounts of 32 agencies receiving contributions from the EU budget by independent external experts.
The Court examined the reliability of the results of this survey in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and considered these when drafting its own judgments.
The Court's examination of the risks identified is a 1.25.
In order to achieve sufficient security, the Court has designed its audit to shed light on the most important identified risks. In general, there is a low risk 1.26 as regards the reliability of the agencies' accounts.
Overall, the Court considers that the risk associated with the reliability of the accounts for all agencies is low.The accounts of the agencies are drawn up using the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, which are based on internationally recognised accounting principles for the public sector.
The number of major errors identified in the past was small.
Title I (Staff expenditure) 1.28.
The Commission's administration of the PMO (Office for the determination and implementation of individual requests) is reviewed by the Court as part of its specific assessments of administrative expenditure.
No significant errors have been identified in relation to staff expenditure in recent years.
However, if the agencies need to recruit large-scale additional staff in the short term, there is a medium to high risk for the legality and regularity of recruitment procedures.
(10) The annual financial statements include the balance sheet, the financial results overview, the cash flow statement, the table of changes in net assets, as well as a summary of the underlying financial statements and other explanations.
(11) The budget implementation reports include the overviews that summarise all revenue and expenditure forecasts, as well as explanations.
(12) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 343, 20.12.2012, p.
DE C 434/14 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Title II (Administrative expenditure) 1.29.
The procurement of various services (with increasing IT concerns) includes complex procurement rules and procedures, and the agencies' administrations sometimes do not achieve satisfactory transparency and not the best price-performance ratio.
Serious award errors affecting the conditions for payment were generally one of the main reasons for closed judgements and Court observations.
Title III (operational expenditure) 1.30.
There is a low to high risk.
This depends on the agency concerned and the nature of its operational expenditure.
In general, the risks associated with procurement are similar to those covered by Title II, but the risks may be more severe.
As regards the financial assistance under Title III of the budget, earlier inspections found that, despite overall improvements, the agencies' controls were not always fully effective.
There is a medium risk in terms of budget efficiency, which was mainly identified in the areas of IT and public procurement procedures.
The Court has already reported on its findings on different IT landscapes in the agencies, weaknesses in IT project management and on procurement procedures that did not guarantee the best price-performance ratio.
In general, the large number of small agencies (see illustrations 1.4 and 1.6) equipped with their own administrative structures and procedures poses a risk in terms of administrative efficiency.

EN C 434/16 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 INTRODUCTION 2.1.
This chapter contains a review of the results of the annual reviews carried out by the Court by the agencies for 2017 and further work in connection with the agencies carried out by the Court in the course of 2017.
THE RESULTS OF THE AGENCIES' ANNUAL PRINTS FOR 2017 ARE TOTAL POSITIV 2.3.
Overall, the Court's audit of the agencies' annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017 and the revenue and payments underlying those annual accounts confirm the positive results from previous years.
The Court has given unrestricted opinions on the annual accounts of all agencies.
According to the Agency's assessment, the agencies' annual accounts represent their financial situation as at 31 December 2017 and the results of their accounts and cash flows for the year ending on that date, in compliance with their respective financial rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer (13) in all relevant respects.
In order to highlight a matter, statements are fundamental to the understanding of annual accounts 2.5.
With regard to EASO, the Court pointed out that the personnel situation in the company deteriorated exponentially.
At present, the company does not have the administrative capacity to fill the many vacancies.
Overall, the continuation of the activities of the B"ros to the present extent is considerably supported by the personnel situation.
In the case of the SRB, the Court pointed out that the contributions to the Single Resolution Fund are calculated on the basis of the information provided by credit institutions to the Committee on national resolution authorities.
However, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework to ensure that this information is sufficient.
The Court also noted that the methodology laid down in the legislation for calculating contributions is very complex, which involves risks for accuracy.
For reasons of confidentiality, the Committee may not disclose the data of credit institutions used for the calculation of the contributions to the funds, which reduces transparency.
With regard to ECHA, the Court stressed that the Agency is partly self-financed and that it receives a fee from each company applying for the registration of chemicals, as provided for in the REACH Regulation(14).
The calculation and billing of fees is carried out by the Agency on the basis of the information provided by the companies at the time of the application.
The ex-post inspections carried out by the Agency have shown that the total amount of these corrections was not known at the end of 2017.
This finding shows the limitations of a system which is too high based on self-disclosures of the applicants.
With regard to GSA, the Court pointed out that the outcome of the public procurement procedure was contested by one of the bidders for one of the Agency's most important contracts (framework agreement worth EUR 1.5 billion).
As regards the two London-based agencies (EMA and EBA), the Court pointed out that they will leave the United Kingdom in 2019 and that their annual accounts, along with additional explanations, were prepared on the basis of the information available at the time of their signature.
The Court also pointed out the impact of the current London lease agreements and the possible decline in revenues resulting from the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemical substances (REACH) (OJ L 287, 12.10.2006, p. 1).
(OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1).
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/17 Unrestricted opinions on the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the accounts of all agencies 2.12.
For all agencies, the Court has issued unreserved judgments on the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017.
According to the Court's assessment, the revenues in all essential matters were legal and orderly.
Unrestricted judgements on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the agencies' annual accounts (except EASO) 2.13.
For 40 agencies, the Court has issued unrestricted judgments on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017.
According to the Court's assessment, payments in all essential respects were legal and orderly.
Since the understandings are systematic, the internal control system is obviously inadequate.
The cumulative error due to the irregular payments concerns at least EUR 7.7 million or 10.3% of the total payments made by the B sucho in 2017.
Paragraphs referring to other matters deal with issues of particular importance 2.15.
Paragraphs referring to other facts should point the reader to important points which are not presented or stated in the annual accounts, nor concern the legality and regularity of revenue and payments.
As regards the EIT, the Court noted that the original reimbursements for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) were raised towards the end of the period.
Furthermore, two KICs have added some new activities to the annual business plans.
For one of the KICs, this resulted in a significant change in the original grant decision.
Substantial changes can affect the equal treatment of the KICs and are not in line with the Financial Regulation.
In the case of Frontex, the Court has repeatedly reported since 2014 that the cooperating states often provide insufficient evidence of the expenditure they claim.
This was also confirmed by this year's results.
In response to the recommendation of the Court in 2016, Frontex is currently implementing a simplified reimbursement model.
With regard to EBA, EIOPA and ESMA, the Court pointed out that their budgets are partly financed by European Union funds and partly by direct contributions from the supervisory authorities and/or the supervised bodies of the EU Member States.
The United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU has led to a reduction in the revenues of the authorities in the future.
With regard to GSA, the Court reported that the Agency operates both the Galileo Security Centre (GSMC) and Galileo ground stations in the United Kingdom, which may need to be relocated.
As regards the CdT, the Court pointed out that several agencies increasingly resorted to in-house or other alternative translations, which meant that the capacity of the centre was not used to the maximum.
Furthermore, at the European level, there is a double burden on the development of translation systems and on-going costs.
In December 2016, the Board of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC's Bureau) commissioned the CdT to translate four calls for expressions of interest in order to draw up reserve lists, despite the fact that all posts approved by the budgetary authority were filled in the Bureau's establishment plan.
According to the Court, the translation order issued in December 2016 was not justified.
The payment made on this order in March 2017 amounted to 2.5% of the 2017 budget.

The Court's observations cover a wide range of topics 2.22.
The Court made a total of 145 comments concerning 37 agencies in order to highlight important issues and identify areas where there is a need for improvement.
These comments in Chapter 3 are summarised below.
Large risks lead to significant vulnerabilities in EASO 2.23.
In the case of EASO, the Court pointed out the major risks that arise from the nature of its activities, as well as the extraordinary challenges posed by the migration crisis.
These risks were not mitigated by a sound governance structure and effective controls, leading to numerous significant violations of legislation.
Since 2014, the B的ro has been struggling with a high staff turnover. Recruitment procedures were suspended in December 2017.
In addition, neither an internal audit office nor a legal service is set up at the office, and legal documents are not systematically superseded.
Almost all the services provided, which were based on public procurement or recruitment procedures, were systematically accused of being subject to considerable constraints in connection with the determination of the needs of the person concerned, the elaboration of specifications, the choice of the type of contract, the evaluation and award procedures, the changes and extensions of contracts, the execution of contracts and the overhaul of the services provided, etc.
These rules are contrary to the principles of competition, transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/19 Progress towards a more unified IT landscape 2.26.
The operational activities of the agencies are broad and require appropriate IT solutions, sometimes tailor-made.
However, central operational and administrative activities are carried out on the basis of the same legal framework, which suggests that their procedures are flexible and that similar IT solutions can be used to support these procedures.
While the agencies made very great progress with regard to the use of similar systems for budget and accounting management, the Court reported on this in its 2016 summary report on the results of inspections at the agencies, and in other core areas such as human resources management and procurement and management, a large number of IT resolutions were still used.
The agencies have agreed to further standardise IT solutions in these areas, especially in order to increase cost efficiency, reduce the risks associated with internal control and strengthen IT governance.
In 2017, a number of progress was made in IT tools for human resources management when 20 agencies concluded agreements with the Commission on the use of the SYSPER II tool, which will create a more unified IT landscape in this area.
The majority of the agencies are to use the Commission's tool from 1 January 2019, while some agencies will use it from the third quarter of 2018.
In this fragmented IT landscape, the use of similar electronic tools for the procurement of supplies and services (electronic procurement) would also be an important step towards a more unified IT framework among agencies.
The Financial Regulation and the Framework Financial Regulation, which entered into force in 2012 and 2013 respectively, are designed and implemented by all EU institutions and agencies to the extent possible by means of a common area for electronic data exchange for applicants, candidates and tenderers (15), (16).
While no target date has been set in the Financial Regulation and the Framework Financial Regulation for the introduction of electronic procurement, the 2014 EU Directive on public procurement(17) prescribes the use of electronic means for public procurement in the EU Member States by 2018, and in accordance with the 2014 EU Directive on electronic invoicing(18) must allow all public bodies to receive electronic invoices by 2019.
(15) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95(2) Electronic Administration (ăe-Government),
(16) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 of 30 September 2013 on the framework Financial Regulation for bodies pursuant to Article 208 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Article 79 of the Electronic Administration (ăe-Government) (OJ L 336, 20.12.2013, p.

EN C 434/20 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 2.29.
All agencies publish their tenders electronically via TED (Tenders Electronic Daily), the online version of the EU Official Journal for public procurement. In addition, the Commission launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015). Most agencies had introduced electronic invoicing and the electronic invitation to tender for certain procedures by the end of 2017, but not the electronic submission of tenders.
Improvement in IT consulting and project management at EMA and eu-LISA IT consulting and project management at EMA 2.30.
In the course of the audit carried out in the previous year, the Court analysed how the Agency manages advisory services.
The use of consulting firms has led to a critical independence of external expertise.
The Court also reported that the control of project development and implementation was insufficient and that the projects were subject to serious delays and cost increases.
During 2017, the Agency took several measures to improve the situation.
However, it will take time to reduce the critical nature of the agency's consulting firms, and the impact of the measures taken will not be apparent until the years have passed.
IT consulting and project management services at eu-LISA 2.32.
Due to the nature of its activity, the Agency uses consulting services mainly in connection with IT projects.
In 2017, the Agency's IT projects were implemented within the financial and time frame.
The Agency uses an outsourcing model for the development and implementation of IT projects, in which around 90% of the corresponding work is carried out by three contractors.
Although the IT projects are the property of the agency and are under its control, a model in which the development capabilities for so sensitive IT systems are outsourced to this extent, entails the risk of an excessive dependence of the contractors.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/21 2.34.
At the same time, the low number of employees in operational key meetings creates a risk for the continuity of the operation.
Public procurement is designed to ensure competition between economic operators and to achieve the most economically viable purchase, in a transparent, objective and consistent manner, on the basis of the current legal framework.
The Court identified Ms in the field of public procurement at 14 agencies (Beuro des BEREK, EPA, Chafea, eu-LISA, EASO, EBA, EEA, EFSA, EIGE, EUIPO, ERA, EASA, FRA and SRB), mostly in the field of services that entail risks for optimal use of funds.
Among the most frequently identified obstacles are the lack of a balanced relationship between price and quality aspects of award criteria, the lack of optimal design of framework agreements, the use of framework agreements allowing the procurement of services, the description and/or price of which were not sufficiently defined and the use of intermediate services.
Most agencies analysed the impact of Brexit 2.36. On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom informed the European Council of its decision to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit).
Unlike most other agencies, five agencies (ACER, Béro des BEREK, EPA, ENISA and EU-OSHA) did not carry out a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of Brexit on their organisation, their operations and their accounting.
Job advertisements could be published on the EPSO website 2.37.
Most agencies (ACER, Cedefop, EPA, Chafea, EASA, EBA, ECHA, EEA, EIGE, EIOPA, EIT, EMA, EMCDDA, EMSA, ENISA, ESMA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, Frontex, GSA and SRB) publish job advertisements on their own websites and on social media, but frequently not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
A publication on the EPSO website would increase transparency and publicity and allow the citizens to view job advertisements of all European institutions and bodies.
The main reason for the agencies is that the EPSO requires the publication of job advertisements in all the official languages of the EU, with high translation costs.
Less comments on the legality and regularity of payments 2.38.
The number of comments on the legality and regularity of payments went back to eight (2016: 11), which illustrates the continuing efforts of the agencies to comply with the legal framework, in particular the provisions of the Financial Regulation and the Framework Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations.
While five comments were made on procurement procedures (EASO, EASA, EIGE and Frontex), three were related to recruitment procedures (EASO, Cedefop and Frontex).
The budget management has improved 2.39.
Under certain conditions, budget appropriations granted for a given year may be transferred to the next year (19).
Although the Financial Regulation does not set ceilings for this type of transfer, the multi-annual nature of the transfers is largely justified. Nevertheless, transfers may be an indication of delays in carrying out the work programmes or contracts and may also run counter to the budgetary principle of legality.
Illustration 2.4 shows how many agencies the Court reported in 2017 and in previous years on high transfers of funds.
The return to only two agencies (Chafea and EU-OSHA) in 2017 is due to the fact that the transfers from the agencies were better and more transparently explained and supported, but also to the changed approach of the Court for reporting 2017.
(19) The conditions for transfers are laid down in Article 13 of the Financial Regulation.
EN C 434/22 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Illustration 2.4 Fewer comments on higher or higher amounts Source: European Court of Auditors based on information provided by the agencies.
Furthermore, the Court noted that two agencies (Frontex and EUIPO) had cancelled budget transfers from previous years.
This was an indication of the overestimated need for funding, in particular on the part of the public authorities of Member States and other cooperating countries.
Accounting could be further improved 2.42.
In the course of this year's audits, the Court also examined the accounting of agencies, which plays an important role in the preparation of reliable annual accounts.
Each agency has its own accountor in accordance with the Financial Regulation. This has resulted in a total of 37 accounts being held responsible for 2% of the EU budget.
The principal tasks of the accountant are the performance of payments, the acceptance of revenue and the recovery of receivables, the preparation and presentation of the annual accounts as well as the accounting management, the establishment and validation of the accounting systems and the treasury management.
In order to improve efficiency, the Commission's accountant asked all agencies to delegate their accounting function to him on a contractual basis in 2012.
The first agency to accept this proposal was the EPO in 2014.
By the end of 2017, only three other agencies (GSA, B to BEREC and ACER) had joined this scheme.
The hierarchical position of an accountant within an agency may affect his independence.
In particular, accountants must be independent of persons who are (subordinately) entitled to make commitments, to enter into legal commitments and to instruct payments.
This observation concerns a total of 13 agencies (CdT, EACEA, EASA, EASME, EEA, EFSA, EIOPA, EMA, EMCDDA, ERA, EU-OSHA, Eurofound and FRA).
The appointment and annual assessment of the accountant should also fall within the scope of responsibility of the Board of Directors.
In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the auditors must confirm that the agencies' accounting systems function reliably (validation).
While the validation of the accounting systems of most agencies is up-to-date, the Court noted that the accounting systems of seven agencies (ACER, B的ro des BEREK, EPA, EASME, EIT, EMA and GSA) could require a timely revalidation due to extensive changes.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/23 Illustration 2.5 The independence of the auditors of the agencies and the revalidation of the accounting systems Source: European Court of Auditors based on information provided by the agencies.
In three agencies (EASO, CPVO and REA), award, grant and recruitment procedures were poorly documented.
Three agencies (ACER, EIT, and Frontex) have identified internal controls for the implementation of the emergency rules.
These angels could represent a significant risk for the maintenance of business operations in the event of disasters, as data could be irrevocably lost.
Agencies continue to monitor findings from previous years 2.47.
If applicable, the Court reported on the state of play in the follow-up actions taken by the agencies on the basis of comments from previous years.
Figure 2.6 shows that the corrective measures relating to the 170 observations not yet implemented at the end of 2016 were completed or in progress in most cases.
Of the 13 outstanding comments, the corrective measures required in relation to three observations were not subject to the Agency's control.

The Court will forward fraud to OLAF 2.48.
OLAF is then responsible for investigating and prosecuting these cases, if necessary in cooperation with national judicial authorities.
In 2017, the Court identified three cases of mutagenic fraud that it reported to OLAF in the context of its investigation of about 1,000 proposals and 150 procurement procedures with regard to the decisions on the agencies.
The Court provides information on Commission Internal Audit Service (IAS) reports and external evaluation reports 2.49.
The Court also referred to IAS audit reports and external evaluation reports prepared on behalf of the Commission for information purposes.
In 2017, 26 IAS reports were prepared and an external evaluation of an agency was carried out in nine cases.
The Court did not exercise the corresponding examination or evaluation processes.
PROCESSING RESULTS FROM OTHER REPORTS WITH THE AGENCIES IN THE COOPERATION CONCERNED BY HOF 2017 SHALL BE RAPID Case Review by the Court for the implementation of the post dismantling by 5 % 2.50.
In 2017, the Court carried out a rapid analysis (20) of how the institutions and agencies of the European Union have implemented their commitment to reduce the staff allocated to them by 5% in the period 2013-2017 (for agencies 2014-2018).
The Court concluded that the agencies had implemented the reduction of staff by 5%, albeit with some delays.
While decentralised agencies with traditional tasks managed to reduce their staff by 8.9%, the number of employees in certain decentralised agencies and executive agencies entrusted with new tasks and responsibilities increased by 19.9% and 42.9% respectively.
Figure 2.7 shows the resulting percentage changes in posts in the posts of all institutions, bodies and agencies.

Special Report of the Court on the SRB 2.51.
The Single Resolution Committee (SRB), headquartered in Brussels, was established in August 2014, as part of the political response to the financial crisis.
The task of the Committee is to resolve insolvency-threatening banks, which fall within its scope of responsibility.
In January 2017, SRB was responsible for 139 banks, including 130 banking groups (21).
In the context of the survey (22) it was examined whether the committee was required to handle banks effectively. Particular attention was paid to the quality of resolution planning for individual banks and to the question whether the committee was prepared to meet the legal requirements in the area of resolution planning and had sufficient human resources to carry out its tasks.
The Court identified deficits in all these areas. However, as the establishment of the Committee as a completely new structure was a huge challenge, the weaknesses in this context need to be seen.
The Court made a number of recommendations to the Committee with a view to drawing up resolution plans and implementing its rules and guidelines, as well as increasing staff and improving procedures in the area of human resources management.
(21) On 1 January 2018, the number of banks and 119 banking groups decreased.

DE C 434/26 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Special Court Annual Report on Contingent Liabilities resulting from the performance of the Single Resolution Committee 2.54.
Under the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (23), the Court must draw up a report on all contingent liabilities resulting from the fact that the Committee, the Council and the Commission perform their duties under this Regulation.
As of 31 December 2016, the contingent liabilities of the Committee resulting from the contributions collected in advance amounted to EUR 842 million, which rose to EUR 1 420 million as of 30 September 2017.
In 2016, the Committee did not initiate bank resolution and, consequently, no contingent liability related to resolution decisions had to be reported for the financial year 2016.
At the time when the Court's 2016 report was published on contingent liabilities resulting from the Board's performance of its duties, 90 legal proceedings had been brought against the Board by the end of October 2017 on the basis of the resolution decision taken in June 2017 concerning Banco Popular Espa-ol S.A. and 46 complaints had been lodged with the SRB's Appeals Committee.
The Commission and the Council were informed of proceedings brought before the Court on 26 which were related to the above-mentioned resolution decision.
Other special reports by the Court relating to one or more agencies 2.55.
Apart from the audit reports dedicated specifically to agencies, during 2017, the Court prepared a series of special reports and analyses on the implementation of EU policies, which concerned a number of agencies (see illustration 2.8).

EN C 434/28 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE NETWORK OF THE EU AGENCIES The agencies welcome the Court's positive conclusions about the reliability of its annual accounts and the underlying accounts.
The network would like to express its concerns that, given that the Commission is only providing them with a basic package of modules in Sysper, the agencies will be forced to do so and will continue to be forced to use separate tools for assessment, teleworking, flexitime and personnel reporting.
The IT landscape in the area of human resources management will therefore only partially become more uniform and even much less so as the Commission can provide services.
The agencies are also able to implement a joint consultation for the services concerned in order to support recruitment procedures which are not currently covered by Sysper.
As far as procurement is concerned, over the past two years there has definitely been a trend towards harmonisation of electronic tools.
This development began in 2015/2016, when the tools for e-PRIOR/electronic procurement designed by DG DIGIT in cooperation with DG BUDG were developed.
Since then, this series of electronic modules has become more and more a standard for all phases of the procurement cycle to which the agencies adhere.
This trend continued in 2018 when new modules for electronic submission and the ABAC LCK module were introduced and submitted to the agencies.
Gradually, the agencies are setting up the use of their own isolated tools, some quickly, some less quickly, but regardless of how rapidly this development will take place, the trend in itself is no longer in place.
The proposed increases in efficiency, which could be achieved by transferring accounting tasks to the European Commission, are difficult to achieve in practice.
The necessary workload not only depends on the balance of the budget, but also on the fact that the annual accounts must be completed at the beginning of each year in a narrow window of time.
Experience shows that for more than one package of annual accounts (i.e. additional funding for delegation agreements), almost twice as much staff is required, even though the corresponding amounts are smaller (and the financial resources are lower).
When these activities were transferred to the Commission, each agency would still require an accounting team, as accounting tasks still have to be carried out.
As long as this is the case, any savings in staff would not correspond to a full-time equivalent.
In addition, the annual fee has to be paid.
For this reason, only a few agencies have decided to transfer this task to the Commission.
The network should point out that no investigation or risk assessment has yet been carried out, which could justify the conclusion that the independence of the accountant would be strengthened if he were directly under the authority of the authorising officer and not a authorised authorising officer.
Some agencies have decided to adopt a charter of accountants, which includes, among other things, arrangements for reporting to the board, if necessary.

We have carried out our inspection in compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as well as the professional behavior requirements of IFAC and the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) of INTOSAI.
Our responsibilities according to these standards are described in more detail in the section ăVerantwortlichkeiten des Präfers.
We are independent in compliance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as well as with the relevant professional behavioural requirements and we have fulfilled our other professional behavioral obligations in compliance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to serve as the basis for our judgment.
Responsibility of management and responsible for monitoring 3.1.2.
The management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the annual accounts on the basis of internationally recognised accounting grounds for the public sector and for the legality and regularity of the accounts underlying these accounts.
This includes the design, establishment and maintenance of internal control structures, as necessary for the preparation and presentation of an annual financial statement that is free from material, intended or unintended, false representations.
The management of the agencies carries the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the accounts underlying their financial statements.
In the preparation of the annual accounts, the management is responsible for assessing the ability of the agencies to carry out business, applying the accounting principle of continuing business, unless management intends to either liquidate the establishment or discontinue business, or has no realistic alternative.
Responsibilities of the officer for the audit of the annual accounts and the underlying results 3.1.5.
Our objectives are to obtain sufficient certainty as to whether the annual accounts of the agencies are free from material misrepresentations and whether the underlying statements are correct and orderly, as well as to the European Parliament and the Council or other competent discharge authorities on the basis of our examination of the reliability of the accounts of the agencies as well as the legality and regularity of the underlying statements.
False representations and interpretations can be intended or unintended and will be considered essential if they could be expected individually or as a whole to incorporate the economic decisions made by users on the basis of these annual accounts.
3.1.6.
With regard to revenue, we shall examine the grants received by the agencies from the Commission or cooperating States and assess their procedures for collecting fees and other revenue, if relevant.
3.1.7.
As regards expenditure, we examine the payment arrangements after the expenditures have been paid, recorded and accepted.
Advance payments are made after the beneficiary has proven their proper use and the agency has accepted the proofs by billing the advance payment in the same year or later.
3.1.8.
As part of a review in agreement with the ISA and ISSAI, we exercise discretion during the whole review and maintain a critical attitude.
In addition, we identify and assess the risks of essential intentional or unintentional misrepresentations in the annual accounts, as well as of essential intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of the legal framework of the European Union in the underlying projections, plan and carry out preliminaries in response to these risks, and obtain evidence of trial that is sufficient and appropriate to serve as the basis for our judgements.
The risk that material misrepresentations or misrepresentations arising from non-doing acts will not be exposed to legislation is more likely than a misrepresentation resulting from misconduct, as non-doing acts may involve fraudulent interaction, executions, intended imperfections, misleading representations or the imposition of internal controls;
C 434/32 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we conclude that there is a substantial uncertainty, we are obliged, in our note of the final report, to draw attention to the relevant information in the annual accounts or, if this information is inappropriate, to modify our opinion.
We draw our conclusions on the basis of the evidence obtained up to the date of our final report.

AGENCY FOR ENERGY GOVERNMENT COOPERATION (ACER) INTRODUCTION 3.2.1.
The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (hereinafter referred to as the Agency), based in Ljubljana, was established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25).
Under the REMIT Regulation (26), the Agency and the national regulatory authorities have been entrusted with additional tasks in terms of monitoring the European energy wholesale market.
The table contains the main figures for the Agency (27).

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF ACCOUNTS 3.2.8. In the course of this year's audit of EU agencies, the Court analysed accounting, including the aspect of the timely (re)validation of accounting systems.
In October 2017, the Agency delegated its accounting function to the Commission's invoicing officer.
Despite this drastic change, the accounting system was last validated in 2011.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.2.9.
In 2011, the agency received an additional task in connection with the monitoring of the energy wholesale market (REMIT).
In 2017, for the first time, all the elements provided for by the REMIT monitoring framework were implemented.
However, the site originally set up in Maribor, Slovenia, was relocated to the Agency's main data center for disaster recovery in April 2017.
As a result, the backup data is now stored at the same location as the original data.
This represents a considerable risk for maintaining business operations in the event of disasters. COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY SURVEILLANCE AND SERVICES 3.2.10. On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom (UK) informed the European Council of its decision to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit).
Unlike most other agencies, the agency did not undertake a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of Brexit on its organisation, operations and accounting.
3.2.11.
The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but usually not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which would increase transparency and publicity and enable the citizens of Europe to consult job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/35 3.2.12.
In line with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform solution for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (30) (31). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT package covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
The agency had not introduced any of these tools by the end of 2017.
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.2.13.
In 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service presented a staff management report to the Agency(32). The Agency prepared an action plan to address areas where there is a potential need for improvement.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.2.14. The annex provides an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.

(32) The Court has not interpreted the work carried out by the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS).
C 434/36 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up to previous comments Statements by the Court of Justice of the European Union The seat agreement between the Agency and the Slovenian government is to be established in Slovenia a European school, but this has still not happened more than four years after the conclusion of the agreement.
In its May 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed the urgent need to improve roles and responsibilities and to analyse the workload of the contracting authority in order to increase the efficiency of processes and procedures.
The IAS also concluded that planning and monitoring of procurement must be significantly improved.The Agency and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
The Agency transferred EUR 4.9 million and 86 % of the appropriations committed under Title III (operational expenditure) to the following financial year (2015: EUR 1.4 million and 59%).
As in previous years, these transfers were mainly linked to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation on the Integrity and Transparency of the Energy Wholesale Trade Market and amounted to 4.7 million euros in 2016 (2015: 1.1 million euros).
For Title II (Administrative expenditure), the Agency transferred EUR 1 million and 38% of the committed appropriations to the following financial year (2015: EUR 0.8 million and 35% respectively).
The higher transfer rate is directly linked to the conclusion and signing of procurement procedures and parts of contracts towards the end of the year, leading to a shift of deliveries and/or payments to the following year.
In 2016, 98 out of a total of 299 sales were signed in November and December (5 976 122.47 euros and 40 % of the total value of the 2016 closed sales).
The Agency may carry out the implementation of a separate budget in order to better meet the multi-annual nature of the activities, as well as inevitable delays between contract signatures, deliveries and payments. Year 2014 2016 2016 2016 State of adoption of the correction (completed/in progress/outstanding/ n.e.c.)
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/37 AGENCY REPLY 3.2.8.
The Agency agrees with the outcome and clarifies that the Agency records all financial transactions in the financial system provided by the European Commission, updated, maintained and validated by the Commission.
With the outsourcing of Service Accounting to the Commission from October 2017, the Agency will accept the validation of the accounting system provided by the Commission in 2018.
Since the ARIS prime location and the site for disaster management migrated to the internal ACER data centre at the beginning of April 2016 and was integrated into a single site in June 2017 to optimize and improve performance and address increasing space requirements, it is no longer possible to maintain operations.
However, it should be noted that the current situation, in which the maintenance of the holding cannot be ensured, has been imposed on the Agency by the serious reduction in its budget over the last two years.
The Agency has repeatedly warned the Commission and the budgetary authorities about the serious consequences of budgetary constraints, but without achieving any result in terms of additional resources.
The Agency will continue to demonstrate the ability to restore a site for disaster management for ARIS, but without providing the necessary resources in 2018.
The restoration of the site for disaster management would require additional financial resources from the Agency.
Given that the risks associated with BREXIT were considered to be low and limited, the management only carried out an informal analysis of Brexit in 2017.
At the beginning of 2018, the Agency published a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Brexit on the organisation management, operation and financial sectors, highlighting the impact and the necessary measures.
In 2014, the Agency's Management Board adopted Decision AB No 15/2014 on the Agency's language regime.
Nevertheless, the Agency still needs to translate the vacancies published on the EPSO website into all official EU languages.
Due to the very limited financial resources that have been repeatedly shown to the budget authority, the Agency is unable to raise the translation costs for each individual job advertisement in all official EU languages for the publication of this call on the EPSO website.
In 2017, four of the nine job advertisements, including two public calls, were published on the EPSO website and therefore translated into all official EU languages.
The remaining five tenders of positions in operational departments were published only on the Agency's website, since they were mainly of interest for applicants who are already active in the field and who usually follow the Agency's actions on our website.
This approach reflects a pragmatic emphasis between contact with potential candidates and efficient use of limited resources.
3.2.12.
In 2018, the Agency will start electronic procurement, which will be extended in 2019 to include the use of electronic invoicing and the electronic transmission of tenders.
3.2.13.
Following the report of the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) on human resources management, the Agency has agreed with the IAS an action plan and is currently implementing the proposed improvements.

Note 3.3.7.
In December 2016, the B'ro commissioned the translation centre for the institutions of the European Union (CdT) to translate four calls for expressions of interest with a view to drawing up reserve lists, despite the fact that all the posts approved by the budget authority in the B'ros establishment plan were filled.
The payment made on this order in March 2017 amounted to 106 432.50 euros (or 2.5% of the 2017 budget).
3.3.8.
OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.3.9.
In the course of this year's examination of EU agencies, the Court analysed accounting, including the aspect of timely (re)validation of accounting systems.
In 2016 the bank delegated its accounting function to the Commission's accounting officer.
In 2017, it introduced a new paperless system.
Although these events resulted in significant changes in the B's procedures and accounting system, the system has not been validated again since 2013.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.3.10.
In December 2017, the B的ro signed legal commitments and commitments of EUR 20 000 for a further training programme planned for the end of March 2018.
The financing of 2018 activities from the 2017 budget is in contradiction with the budgetary principle of annuality.
In August 2015, the B sucho launched an invitation to tender for a multi-service framework agreement in the cascade system, covering an estimated market volume of EUR 3 million for the organisation and planning of events such as meetings, workshops, conferences, etc.
Furthermore, the competitive procedure only covered the bidder's administrative fees, but not the potential event costs.
The award procedure thus did not lead to appropriate price competition, which might not have led to the most economically viable offer.
3.3.12.
The agencies should define a common framework for electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (37) (38). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT overview, covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).

On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom informed the European Council of its decision to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit).
Unlike most other agencies, the B-ro did not carry out a comprehensive analysis of Brexit's potential impact on its organisation, operations and accounting.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.3.14. The annex provides an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/41 ANNEX Follow-up to observations from previous years Court observations The budget for the 2014 budget by national regulatory authorities of the EFTA(1) countries, which have observer status in BEREC, has not been paid in the absence of agreements with these countries.
In March 2016, the B sucho initiated an award procedure with the aim of concluding a framework contract for the children of its staff with the two international schools in Riga.
The 400,000 Euro framework agreement signed in July 2016 is therefore based on contradictory concepts, creating legal uncertainty for the bank and schools.
In addition, a framework agreement was not applicable in this particular case.
In the course of a reclassification, a member of staff was appointed directly to step 2 instead of step 1 of a higher grade, which is contrary to the EU Staff Regulations.
In March 2016, the B不ro signed a contract worth 60 000 euros on the provision of professional support and advisory services in the area of personnel.
In 2016, the average length of employment of the staff of the bureau was 2.58 years. Personnel turnover was high at 25 %.
A possible reason is the correction coefficient in relation to salary costs for the host country (73%).
Periodic external performance evaluations are not required by the regulations of the company.
The Committee, together with the Commission, should request such an evaluation at least every five years, as most other agencies do.

DE C 434/42 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE B
In order to comply with the obligation to publish calls for expressions of interest (40) on the EPSO website (41), BEREC's office had to translate the documents into all the official languages of the EU.
With pre-established reserve lists, it is possible for the Agency to fulfil the mandate of the Management Committee to maintain the quota of vacant posts below 15% and to send job vacancies within one month of the establishment of a recruitment requirement.
To avoid the high cost of the required translations in the future, BEREK's B sucho intends to develop standard templates for calls and short-term translation sections.
3.3.9.
In 2016 BEREK's account was transferred to the European Commission.
Therefore, the accountant of the European Commission (within DG Budget) provides all the services required under Article 50 of the framework financial regulation applicable to the agencies, including the validation of local systems.
The validation approach is currently under way and has been announced by the European Commission's accountant in an official note with the reference number Ares(2018)3149885 of 14 June 2018.
The departments of the European Commission's invoicing officer will finalise the procedure and submit a report on the results in the fourth quarter of 2018.
3.3.10.
BEREK's team had already started preparing for the training in November 2017, in contact with potential instructors and had discussed the feasibility of the venues.
Therefore, it was necessary to sign the contract with the organiser in order to ensure the feasibility of both the instructors and the conference manager as well as the venue for the planned dates of the training.
The contract was signed in December 2017, so that a corresponding commitment under the Financial Regulation was entered into prior to the signing of the contract.
Experience shows that it is very difficult to organise further training in the first quarter of a year without transferring funds from the previous year; the BEREC's office will therefore make shorter dates for future further trainings.
3.3.11.
The decision for a framework contract was made in 2015.
The Commission concluded that it would be compatible with the financial regulation since other EU institutions have concluded several such contracts and still close (e.g. travel or banking services).
Due to the special nature of BEREC's activity, a large part of BEREC's expenditure on events carried out by BEREC's business, the increase in experts, mainly from public authorities located in the EU Member States (e.g. national regulatory authorities, NRAs).
It should therefore be noted that the contractor has no influence on this type of expenditure.
Following the comments and the valuable exchange of views with the Court, BEREC's Office will also consider other types of framework contracts which were not provided for under the 2015 legal framework when the award procedure was reopened.
BEREC's B"ro takes note of the Court's comments and informs the Court that it intends to implement these modules by the end of 2018, taking into account the feasibility of the Agency's budget.
3.3.13.
The impact on the agency's workload could not be assessed until relations between the EU and the United Kingdom were terminated.

We take note of the Court's comment on the irregularities in the two recruitment procedures.
Cedefop is currently conducting a thorough assessment of the two procedures and is planning to take corrective measures in these two cases and in recruitment procedures in general in order to address the weaknesses identified by the Court.
COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.4.9
Cedefop uses the EPSO platform in some cases.
Cedefop publishes its job offers on its own website and on the agency's on-line platform, which is accessible to all EU citizens, and uses various vacancies for job vacancies, including ReferNet, SkillsNet, Board of Directors, as well as other opportunities such as networks of economists, etc. Cedefop publishes the job offers for the position of Director and Deputy Director of the EPSO and uses its social media vacancies for management positions.
Cedefop considers that the additional costs associated with the translation of job vacancies into all EU official languages for the EPSO portal are not of any benefit.
Cedefop has taken the first steps to follow the electronic tendering and submission of tenders (modules of the platform ăe-Prior) in autumn 2018, thus complying with the deadline laid down in Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement to all public contracting entities for the application of the electronic exchange of information with economic operators (http://ec. europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement_en).
Cedefop is working with the Commission's Directorate-General DIGIT, which is responsible for the involvement of public authorities.
The first general call for tenders using the modules for the electronic tendering and the electronic submission of tenders will be launched in October 2018.
All general procedures are then handled using the electronic tools.
The date for the start of electronic invoicing depends on whether Cedefop's management decides either to introduce a regular invoicing (where electronic invoicing is used as a module) or to continue using the internal Fibus platform (where a link to the electronic invoicing platform must be established).

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.5.8.
The Court considers it necessary for the purposes of strengthening the independence of the accountant by directing it to the Director (administrative concerns) and to the Board of Directors (functional concerns) of the Agency. COMMENTS ON LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ORDER OF THE PROPOSALS 3.5.9.
Framework agreements are concluded with companies to determine the terms and conditions applicable during the period of the agreement for certain procurements (individual contracts).
The Agency used a framework agreement with three contractors in the cascade system to provide IT services of up to EUR 22 million.
In this procedure, the contractors are placed in a ranking (the cascade) following a competitive procedure, which must be respected in all individual cases.
However, the terms of the framework agreement were not specific enough to allow fair competition and to justify the establishment of a ranking of contractors for all future individual contracts.
Under the provisions of the Financial Regulation(54), individual contracts must be awarded under these conditions by means of a competitive procedure between the selected contractors.
3.5.10.
The Agency's financial regulations (55) must be approved by the Board of Directors, either in the Agency's annual work programme or through an ad hoc financing decision.
An IT framework agreement with a maximum amount of EUR 15 million was tendered and signed, although the financing decision covered only EUR 5 million.
In 2014, the Commission entered into a framework agreement on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including EASA) with a contractor on the acquisition of IT hardware and software as well as maintenance and support services (IT services).
The contractor of the framework agreement acts as intermediary between the agency and companies that can provide the IT services.
Most of these IT services and the prices were defined in the framework agreement concluded on the basis of the competitive award procedure, but this also includes the procurement of non-specialised IT services.
In case of a paid payment of about 300 000 euros, the agency had acquired via the contractor IT services without competitive process.
In 2017, a total of EUR 2 million was paid to the contractor of the framework agreement.

In accordance with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a single framework for electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (56) (57). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT aggregate covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the Commission, by the end of 2017, the Agency had introduced the electronic invitation to tender and the electronic submission of tenders for certain procedures, but not electronic invoicing.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/49 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Statements by the Court Although the activities financed by industry led in 2016 to a deficit of 7.6 million euros, the budgetary results differ from year to year(1), and the Agency has accumulated a surplus of 52 million euros from this type of activity.
The Agency's resolution stipulates that the fees to be paid by industry should be adequate to reduce the Agency's costs for the associated licensing capacity.
In the period 2014-2016, the agency used for its move to a new building 9.4 million euros (2016: 4.4 million euros) of its cumulated surplus to finance the costs of 12.4 million euros incurred for the renovation (and relocation).
The Commission, for its part, contributed EUR 3 million from the EU budget to this end.
Year 2016 2016 Status of correction acceptance (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
EN C 434/50 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.5.8.
The Agency has tackled this issue within the framework of the Agency Network Forum in order to promote opportunities and reach a common position.
The Agency will implement the agreed common approach and in any case will clearly separate the role of the accounting officer from operational functions and involve the Management Board in the renewal and evaluation cycle.
3.5.9.
In order to prepare this procedure, the Agency carried out a market analysis and concluded that the main IT service providers supported all the necessary services under this procedure.
As a result, the Agency has concluded that a multi-framework agreement with a renewed call for competition would lead to a high administrative burden, which was considered to be immediate compared to the benefit that might result from it.
As with tenders with a high contract value and as a result of the Court's comment, the Agency will take steps to reopen competitions in the future in order to promote competition.
The aim of this framework agreement is to support the proof of concept and the initial phase of a new project (Data4Safety), whose financing and structure have developed over months with a number of parties.
The order value amounted to 15 million euros, but the financial obligations in the end amount to a maximum of 4 million euros.
Thus, the possibility of making payments beyond this amount escapes.
3.5.11.
The Agency considers that this approach, when using the existing interinstitutional framework agreement, is in line with the principle of sound financial management.
In the present case, a remuneration of EUR 24 816.60 was considered appropriate compared to the volume of the purchase and the required cost.
This facilitate was provided for in the framework agreement and the agency used it for compatibility purposes.
In 2015, the Agency's Management Board (Decision No 08-2015) decided that the working language of EASA is English in relation to the recruitment and selection procedures.
This decision was notified to the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which does not accept the decision as an exception to its rules for the publication of job advertisements in all languages, and the decision does not meet the Agency's needs.
The network of agencies has recently set up an online platform that allows the agencies to publish their job advertisements on a wider scale.
EASA regularly publishes external job advertisements on this new platform.
3.5.13.
The Court noted that last year the instrument for the electronic submission of procurement procedures was introduced.
For electronic invoicing, the business specifications were completed in 2017, and the Agency's resources and priorities are looking for an IT solution.

According to our assessment, the revenue underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 is legal and regular in all essential respects.
Payments A judgment on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.6.6.
The Court points out that the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its decision to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March 2017 without questioning its judgment.
An agreement on the details of the withdrawal is currently being negotiated.
The London-based account has prepared its annual accounts and the informed statements on the basis of the information available at the time of signature (3 May 2018).
3.6.8.
On 20 November 2017, the General Affairs Council of the European Union pledged itself to move the building to Paris, France.
The move is planned for early 2019, and the account of the bank has shown the associated costs of 6.7 million euros in revenue and 11.2 million euros for contractual payments to be made for the London office in the future.
3.6.9.
3.6.10.
In four of the five open award procedures, only one tenderer fulfilled the award criteria for quality, all other bidders were excluded.
This suggests that the aid overemphasizes the quality criteria.
It is not possible for such procedures to determine the most economically viable solutions where quality and price should be balanced.
3.6.12.
The journal publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but generally not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which would increase transparency and publicity and enable the citizens to view job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies.
3.6.13.
The agencies should define a common framework for electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (63) (64).

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/55 REPLY OF THE REPLY 3.6.11.
In carrying out procurement procedures, the EBA strives to use all the tools available to it to maximize competition.
Four out of five procedures included the weighting of quality and price 60 to 40, the other 50 to 50. In our opinion, the low level of participation in the financial evaluation undertaken by the Court has to be reduced to factors on which the EBA has no influence; this includes, among other things, the low interest in the tender (due to the exchange rate risk, the volume of the contract, the high costs for participation in the tender and the low profit margins) as well as the poor quality of the professional offers.
EBA publishes its job advertisements in numerous media: EBA website, Twitter and LinkedIn, EU Training, EuroBrussels and EurActiv, ESCB-HRC network, Financial Times and similar (for positions with a higher profile).
In February 2018, the EBA published ten job vacancies on the EPSO website in all EU official languages.
The EBA considers that, by using the above mentioned channels for the publication of job advertisements, it is fully transparent and reaches the target audience among EU citizens.
The EBA will set up the system of electronic submission of bids (e-submission) in 2019 and will carry out training in the first half of the year as well as testing the updates of the introduced system.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/57 Highlighting a case 3.7.5.
Without questioning the judgment in paragraph 3.7.4, the Court would like to stress that the Agency is partly self-financed and that it receives a fee from any company applying for the registration of chemicals, as provided for in the REACH Regulation (72).
The applicable charges are based on the size of the enterprises (smallest enterprises, small, medium and large enterprises) and on the quantity of registered chemicals (various quantity thresholds).
3.7.6.
As provided for in the Financial Regulation(73), the Agency calculates and invoices the fees on the basis of information provided by the companies at the time of the application.
Since the first registrations in 2009, around 30 % of companies have reported that they are micro-enterprises, small or medium-sized enterprises.
The agency has made considerable efforts to set up a system for ex-postberprüfungen which will provide the information of these applicants on the enterprise size of the enterprise.
The Agency was thus able to establish that, on the basis of the operations completed so far, some 55% of the above-mentioned companies, which, according to their own figures, were micro, small or medium-sized enterprises (16% of all enterprises), had wrongly indicated their size, leading to lower costs.
To remedy this situation, the agency has charged around 16.4 million euros for the correction of expenses over the years as a result of ex-post inspections.
However, the overruns are considerably in decline, and the remaining amount of necessary fee corrections was not known at the end of 2017 (74).
This finding shows the limitations of a system that is too high based on self-disclosure by the applicants.
The REACH Regulation states that the quantity declared by the undertakings is the responsibility of the Member State authorities responsible for enforcement.
The agency is therefore not involved in the supervision of this second element for the calculation of the costs.
Payments Jurisdiction of the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.7.8.
According to our assessment, the payments underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 are legal and orderly in all essential respects.
3.7.9.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.7.10.
The agency's ex-post surveys have shown that more than half of the companies that registered and reported chemicals were micro-enterprises, small or medium-sized enterprises that were incorrect in terms of size (see the paragraph highlighting a situation in point 3.7.5).
This can be explained in part by the Commission's complex rules for determining company size (75) and in part by the financial incentive to indicate too little size, since registration fees for companies are far higher.
Since the original registration fees are collected on the basis of the enterprise size indicated, false information can have a significant negative impact on the Agency's revenue if it is not discovered.
Although the agency is responsible for the specified size of the smaller companies in the context of ex-post processing, the overruns are considerably at the bottom of the list and only by 2012 (for the years with the largest registered quantities of chemicals).
(72) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
(73) Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 340/2008 on fees and charges payable to the European Chemicals Agency in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (OJ L 352, 31.12.2008, p.
(74) At the end of 2017, the ex-post translations for the registrations were completed by 2012, but are still in progress for the following years.
(75) Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 on the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).
EN C 434/58 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.7.11.
If errors are detected, the Agency shall charge the difference between the original fee paid and the final fee paid, as well as an administrative fee.
On December 31, 2017, the amount to be recovered amounted to EUR 4.7 million, of which EUR 3.2 million was related to over-the-counter administrative charges.
However, the Agency appears to be encountering difficulties in collecting administrative fees.
In its 2017 annual accounts, the Agency recorded a return on irrecoverable receivables of EUR 2.8 million (i.e. EUR 600 000 more than at the end of 2016).
3.7.12.
The exercise of the powers of enforcement is the responsibility of the Member States responsible for the enforcement of the quantities declared by the undertakings and the Agency has no powers of enforcement (see paragraph 3.7.5).
The measures taken by the enforcement authorities of the Member States are coordinated by the Forum for the exchange of information on enforcement.
On 6 December 2017, the Forum adopted new strategies and minimum criteria for the enforcement of chemical regulations (ăStrategies and minimum criteria for enforcement of chemical regulations), which provide a framework for the development of national enforcement strategies.
The Agency's ability to fulfil its mission depends on the effectiveness of the implementation of this framework by national authorities.
In its general report for 2017, the Agency states that around two thirds of companies did not update the registered information on the quantities of chemicals they handle.
This concerns the effective implementation of the REACH Regulation and also the accuracy of the calculation of costs.
COMMENTS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.7.13. The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but usually not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
OTHER COMMENTS 3.7.14.
The Agency's revenue from fees is linked to the registration periods for chemicals in the EU, which are set out in the REACH Regulation (2010, 2013 and 2018).
The agency therefore does not impose any regular charges and has to struggle with a mismatch between relatively stable expenditure and more fluctuating, less predictable revenues, which makes budgeting more difficult.
The Agency is supported in dealing with this situation by a grant which it receives from the Commission.
As the third and final registration period for chemicals expires in 2018 under the REACH Regulation, revenues from fees and charges are expected to fall from 2019 and the Agency will be dependent on the EU budget to finance its operations.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.7.15. The annex gives an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/59 Year 2014 2016 2016 2016 State of adoption of the correction (closed/in progress/outgoing/n.z.) In progress (1) In progress Outgoing ANNEX Follow-up of comments from previous years Statements by the Court The expenditures for procedures related to a new specific activity of the Agency, the implementation of the regulation on biocidal products, were in principle covered by charges for the evaluation of the application for registration of these products.
However, the fees collected in 2014 only covered 17% of this expenditure, so that the rest of the budget was actually financed by contributions from the Union (6.3 million euros) and EFTA countries (0.2 million euros) to the Agency's budget. At 10.1 million euros and 39% (2015: 7.3 million euros and 32%), the rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year was still high for Title III (operational expenditures - REACH). In Title IV (operational expenditure - biocides), it was even higher at 1.3 million euros and 68% (2015: 1.5 million euros and 74%).
Such a high transfer rate is contrary to the budgetary principle of legality. The agency can draw in agreement to use more and more separate budgetary resources to better cope with the multi-annual nature of the activities as well as inevitable delays between contract signings, deliveries and payments.
ECHA contributes to the functioning of the market for biocides and biocidal products.
In its November 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the structure and practical implementation of the ECHA's internal control system in relation to the Agency's processes and activities under the Biocidal Products Regulation is effective and efficient.
Although no serious findings have been made, the IAS still sees a need for improvement.
Unlike most other agencies, ECHA's regulation does not explicitly require periodic external evaluations of their activities, which are essential for performance assessment.
(1) In 2017, the Agency in the field of biocides collected fees and charges of EUR 8.1 million (2016: EUR 7.6 million), covering 65% of the expenditure on biocides (2015: 62% and 2016: 88%).
The rest was financed by contributions from the Union (6.3 million euros) and EFTA countries (0.2 million euros) to the Agency's budget.
EN C 434/60 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.7.10.
The relevant legislation (REACH-Gehrenverordnung (EC) 340/2008) does not stipulate that the Agency should carry out an ex-post verification of the size of all SME registrants.
The Agency's Board of Directors approved a concept in which SME registrants with the largest financial impact (i.e. with most registrations within the largest volume range) are given priority.
The agency 你berpr的ft currently the enterprise size of SME registrants, who submitted their dossiers until 2015. In 2017, the agency also focused on SME registrants from the United Kingdom, in order to overstep their enterprise size before the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.
In the future we will carry out the agency over the size of SMEs more on the basis of the cost-benefit principle.
3.7.11.
REACH Regulation (EC) No 340/2008 does not provide the Agency with any tools necessary to enforce the collection of excessive administrative charges.
The Agency proactively reminds debtors of their obligation to pay. If this is not successful, it commissions local law firms to apply the outstanding fees and charges directly in the Member States.
The law firms have so far contacted 74% of the companies that have to pay overfllige administrative fees. The result of this initiative is then subjected to a cost-benefit analysis to determine the next steps.
Member States have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of the REACH and CLP regulations, in particular the obligation to register chemical substances.
The ability of the agency to carry out its mission and to generate revenues from the fees to an appropriate extent depends on the effectiveness of the practical implementation of enforcement strategies by the national authorities.
Discussions are being held with the Commission to address this problem.
3.7.13.
The Agency takes note of the previous comment, which is a horizontal matter which concerns a number of agencies.
The Agency publishes job advertisements similar to other agencies on its own website, on social media and on the website of the EU Agency Network (EUAN) (https://euagencies.eu/).
In order to increase transparency and publicity and to enable the citizens to view job vacancies, the Agency recommends that the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) refer to the EUAN website.
3.7.14.
The previous remark is correct.
The Agency shall be financed by a combination of revenue from fees and charges and from a compensatory subsidy from the European Union.
The Agency has submitted a number of alternative financing proposals to the Commission, including the introduction of regular fees, as with some other EU agencies.
The Agency points out that, according to its Communication on the review of the REACH Regulation of 5 March 2018 (COM(2018) 116 final), the Commission will implement all possible options to ensure sustainable financing of the Agency in the future.

In order to publish job advertisements on the EPSO website, they must be translated into all 24 official languages of the EU.
As this has a significant impact on the budget, EIOPA decided to use other media in which most EU agencies publish their job advertisements.
EIOPA also uses the agency's Inter-Agency Job Advertising Board, a joint platform developed by the agency's network for job advertisements to which all citizens have access.
In addition, EIOPA is in charge of a joint procurement procedure for the announcement of recruitment procedures, which provides greater visibility and reaches a wider audience in the EU.

EUROPEAN INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE (EIT) INTRODUCTION 3.9.1.
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (hereinafter referred to as the Institute), based in Budapest, was established by Regulation (EC) No 294/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (82).
The aim of the Institute is to contribute to sustainable economic growth in Europe and to increase competitiveness by strengthening the innovation capacity of the Member States and the European Union.
The Institute provides financial support to an increasing number of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) that combine higher education, research and the economy and thus foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
The KICs coordinate the activities of hundreds of partners.

Other comments 3.9.7.
In December 2016 的 shortly before the end of the promotion period (1 January 2016-31 December 2016) 的 the EIT signed changes to the individual grant agreements with the KIC EIT Digital, InnoEnergy, Health and RawMaterials.
The modification of the individual grant agreement with Climate KIC was signed even in January 2017, after the end of the funding period.
The increase in individual reimbursements agreed in these changes allowed the KICs to receive an additional 15 million euros in EIT financial support (6.0 million euros in addition for Climate KIC, 5.6 million euros for EIT Health, 2.2 million euros for KIC InnoEnergy and 1.2 million euros for EIT RawMaterials).
This approach is contrary to the intention to encourage the KICs to develop sources of finance and to encourage them to gradually reduce their financial dependence from the EIT.
It could also affect fair competition between the KICs, as the co-financing of expenditure also plays a role in the annual grant decisions.
3.9.8.
Also due to changes in the business plans of KIC InnoEnergy and EIT Digital, some of the non-provisional activities in the original business plans were added to the total value of around 3.3 million euros and 0.6 million euros respectively.
In the Court's view, the activity added in the case of KIC InnoEnergy constitutes a substantial change in the original business plan, on the basis of which the maximum amount of financial assistance has been obtained.
As the amount of the grants awarded to each KIC is the result of a performance-oriented over-the-counter procedure to which their originally proposed operations are subject, further substantial changes to these agreements may be considered to be the grant decisions and equal treatment of the KICs and hence an infringement of Article 180(4) of the Financial Regulation.
3.9.9.
COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.9.10.
In 2017, the Institute introduced a paperless payment system.
Although this resulted in changes in his procedures and his accounting system, the accounting system has not been revalidated since 2012.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.9.11.
In order to further strengthen the internal control system for financial assistance to KICs, the EIT set up centralised ex ante controls for those KIC partners whose cost statements exceeded EUR 325 000.
The controls were carried out by two economic operators on behalf of the EIT (86) and led to certified cost statements by the KIC partners.
The results of ex post controls carried out by another EIT-managed business organisation confirm that the new approach to certified cost statements is effective and important, as most of the significant errors identified concerned cost statements that had not been subjected to these ex ante controls.
(86) In previous years, the certification was carried out by many private economic operators on behalf of the individual KIC partners whose submitted cost statements exceeded the threshold of 325 000 euros (refund of actual costs and unit costs).
EN C 434/66 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.9.12.
The business continuity plan and the plan for re-launching following a disaster recovery plan of the EIT were adopted in 2013 and are outdated.
For example, more than half of the members of the crisis management team no longer worked for the EIT in 2017.
An updated version of the Pl的ne has been under construction for two years, but it has not yet been adopted.
As in previous years, the KICs have not exhausted the grants granted by the EIT in full.
The total eligible cost of the KIC added value activities of the FMI, which were functional before 2016 (KICs of the first and second wave combined), were 15% lower than those adopted in the individual financial assistance agreements concluded at the beginning of 2016 (87).
The fact that the funds were not used was mainly due to the -- partly due to the late approval of the grant agreements and the multi-annual nature of the KIC activities conditional ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of these funds have been used to increase the costs associated with KIC-value-added activities, as originally set out in individual refund rates (see point 3.9.7).
In particular, the second wave KICs (EIT Health and RawMaterials) had to struggle with delays in starting their activities.
The performance of Climate KIC was particularly insufficient for the first wave KICs, according to the EIT assessment reports.
3.9.14.
The EIT assessed the implementation of the business plans and then calculated some corrections.
However, these corrections did not have any financial impact on the KICs.
In line with the Horizon 2020 methodology for the grant calculation, the EIT applies only the higher of the two in the case of corrections that become necessary due to financial controls and performance assessments.
While this methodology is appropriate for individual Horizon 2020 projects, it is less appropriate for the grants granted to the KICs, which finance a wide range of different activities.
It is questionable whether it is justified to set aside corrections made on the basis of performance, for example for educational activities, against corrections made on the basis of financial controls, which may, for example, affect innovation projects.
3.9.15.
In 2017, all KICs, in line with the EIT's strategies for sustainable financing, took an important step towards a greater sustainability of KICs in the future.
Nevertheless, the KICs of the first wave still generated little revenue (between 2% and 6% of the costs of the KIC value added activities) and little progress was made in 2017.
Co-financing by the KIC partners is also low (and lower than in the original individual financial assistance agreements): KIC value-added activities are still financed by 62% to 90% of EIT funding, depending on the KIC.
3.9.16.
The EIT publishes job advertisements on its own website and on the DG Human Resources and Security website, but usually not on the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) website.
3.9.17.
The agencies should define a common definition of electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (88). The Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT framework covering all stages of public procurement procedures as well as for the EU institutions.
It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic call for tenders in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
OTHER COMMENTS 3.9.18.
The current interim director of the EIT took office in July 2014.
A selection procedure for the appointment of a new director was launched in 2016, but remained unsuccessful.
Since then, no new recruitment procedure has been initiated.
To fill this post over such a long period of time ad interim is contrary to the statute, according to which a post may be occupied temporarily for a maximum of a year.
3.9.19.
Article 5(1) of the Statute of the EIT shall be directly employed by the EIT staff within the framework of temporary contracts and shall apply to the staff of the EIT to the conditions of employment of other servants of the European Union.
The EIT can therefore offer temporary workers only temporary jobs with a maximum duration of five years, which can be renewed by five years.
Those employees who have started their work at the EIT shortly after its establishment in 2009 will reach the maximum contract term of ten years in 2020, which in the coming years could lead to objections to the continuity of the measures and the administration.

(89) The court did not carry out this inspection work.
(90) The Court has not carried out this evaluation work.
C 434/68 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Year 2012 2014 2014 2014 2015 2015 Progress of correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/n.z.)Completed (1) In progress (2) In progress (3) Completed In progress ANNEX Follow-up of observations from previous years Court observations No specific thresholds for specific cost categories (staff costs, subcontracting, legal services, etc.) were set in the grant agreements.
The Institute estimated that its budget requirements for 2014 were too high by 13.1 million euros or 5.6% (2013: 3.4 million euros and 2.5% respectively), so that only 220 million euros were committed to the 233.1 million available.
The low implementation rate is mainly due to unused resources for grants (11.4 million euros) to finance KIC activities.
According to the business plans of the KICs, on the basis of which the grant agreements were concluded, the funds available to the Institute for 2014 did not have to be used in full.
The unused funds will be included in the budget for 2015-2017 in accordance with the financial regulation of the Institute.
Although the KIC strategies must develop a sustainable financing, they still stand out from the funding provided by the Institute and the KIC partners in the fifth year of their existence.
Since its establishment in 2009, the Institute has had to struggle with a high staff turnover and instabilization at the management level.
Two of the three Head of Unit posts have been vacant since 2013.
One of them has been implemented ad interim since 2013, which is contrary to the statute, which provides for a maximum duration of one year.
The other currently holds the COO, which is also interim director and thus fulfills three functions at the same time.
In its Special Report No 4/2016, the Court concluded that the condition under which the EIT contribution to the KICs should not exceed 25% did not provide a significant advantage and that its removal would significantly reduce the burden on KIC partners on operational and financial reporting (4).
However, these certificates are of first and foremost different quality, so that the security that can be derived from them is limited and the Institute must carry out additional controls.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/69 DE Comments of the Court of Justice of the EIT-Grundungsverordnung regarding the tasks of the institute the ămobilization of funds from public and private sources and [the] use of resources according to the provisions of this regulation.
In particular, the Institute aims to raise a significant and growing share of its budget from private financial contributions and revenue generated by its own activities.
Despite this provision, which clearly refers to the budget of the EIT, the contribution from Horizon 2020 was 99% of its budget for 2015.
Although the institution may use unused funds (i.e. funds not committed or released at the end of the year) in the budget for the following three years, it has not adjusted its procedures in time to allow EUR 26.6 million available from the 2014 grant agreements in the budget for the years 2015-2017.
These funds were available because the KICs used less funding than expected.
According to the Commission's original objective, the Institute should gain its financial autonomy in 2010.
In June 2011, however, the Institute received financial autonomy only in part, as grant proposals and procurement procedures worth more than EUR 60 000 will continue to be subject to prior approval by the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (which is superordinate to it).
The Institute supports the Master School programme of EIT Digital, in which 16 European universities participate.
The model for the reimbursement of the costs of the universities is based on a combination of a lump sum of at most 8 000 Euro/students (comprising the provisions of the Erasmus Mundus programme) plus the actual costs including flat-rate calculated indirect costs.
On this basis, the universities received an average of 15 000 Euro/students in 2015 (including the lump sum).
However, the model was not fixed at any time, and it is not possible to distinguish which activities fall under the lump sum and which fall under the actual costs.
The Institute should convert the cost claim to a clear, formalised model based on a single method, such as a single lump sum based on proof of costs.
Year 2015 Progress of correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
C 434/70 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's observations Against the principle of sound financial management was infringed when another KIC partner commissioned public relations services with daily rates of between EUR 800 and EUR 3 250 per person, which were reimbursed by the Institute in full (7).
For the organisation of conferences on innovation scheduled in 2015 and 2016, the Institute drew on a Commission framework agreement.
The prices agreed for these services ranged from 800 euros per day for a junior consultant and 2 250 euros per day for a senior consultant (and were almost four times as high as the rate laid down in the framework agreement for a leader).
The services provided at these prices amount to more than 100 000 euros per conference.
The Court found weaknesses in the ex-post inspections of the procurement procedures carried out by the legal entities of the KICs.
At least for one of the KIC's legal entities, the selection of the procurement procedures to be applied was not representative for the population.
In addition, the Court reached a different conclusion in two award procedures concerning their legality and regularity.
In these cases, the Institute had accepted the direct specification or the additional expansions of the units.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded in its audit report ăGrant Management: Transition to Horizon 2020 (Financial Assistance Administration: transition to Horizon 2020) that the Institute has successfully adapted its procedures to the rules in force for Horizon 2020, in particular the rules for participation, and that the controls carried out by the Institute in the initial phase have generally proved to be an effective means of supporting new KICs.
The IAS also concluded that measures should be urgently taken to ensure the reliable application of the framework for Horizon 2020 and to further improve the start-up phase of new KICs.The Institute and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
At EUR 0.4 million or 40% (2015: EUR 0.4 million or 44%), the rate of committed appropriations for Title II for the following financial year was high.
These transfers concern mainly year-on-year IT services, as well as meeting costs to which no invoices have yet been received.
Year 2015 2015 Progress of corrective measures adopted (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.) n.e.c. 2016 Completed 2016 In course of 2016 n.e.c.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/71 EN Court's comments The financial assistance for the calendar year 2015 was awarded only in April 2015 and the grant agreements were signed in June and July 2015.
For the calendar year 2016, grants were awarded and the grant agreements were signed in April 2016.
Despite an improvement in 2016, these delays in the decisions on the award of grants and the signing of grant agreements lead to uncertainty and to the willingness of partners to commit resources at the beginning of the year and to initiate activities.
The most recent calls for new KICs, whose thematic areas were defined in the Strategic Innovation Agenda of the EIT for the period 2014-2020, will be subject to little competition.
Only seven proposals were submitted for the call for two KICs (Health and RawMaterials) launched in 2014.
Following the 2016 call for two additional KICs (food and manufacturing) three proposals were received, and the only proposal for KIC manufacturing (additional value in manufacturing) was not selected from quality sources.
The position of director has been occupied since August 2014 and another post of leadership since February 2013 is occupied by ad interim.
This is not only against the Statute, which states that the temporary occupation may not last longer than one year, but that the frequent changes and long-term interim changes are also unsettling the stakeholders and affect the strategic continuity. With a budget of 2.4 billion euros in the period 2014-2020, the Institute is an important player in the implementation of the Horizon 2020 programme.
The Commission has created a central support body for Horizon 2020 to ensure coherence between the programme-run bodies in areas such as legal services, IT tools, grant management, dissemination and exploitation of research results, etc.
However, unlike institutions such as the Commission's executive agencies and public-private partnerships, the Institute does not have direct access to the support body, but must be approved by the Commission's superordinate directorate-general.
This requirement affects the efficiency of the Institute's activities.
Year 2016 State of acceptance of correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
C 434/72 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court observations The coordination and representation of the KICs is carried out by the legal entities of the KICs, which are financed almost entirely by the Institute.
The Court's examination focused on the award procedures carried out by these bodies, which it considers to be a highly risky area.
In accordance with the 2015 grant agreements, the legal entities of the KICs and/or the KIC partners must ensure that the best possible price-performance ratio is achieved in procurements or that the lowest price criterion is applied where appropriate.
For all contracts over EUR 60 000, the legal entities of the KICs and/or the KIC partners shall, according to the grant agreements, require at least three economic operators to tender and document the award procedure to demonstrate its transparency.
The Court carried out a sample of procurement procedures worth around 7 million euros, carried out by the legal entities of the KIC and financed entirely by the EIT.
The investigation has revealed significant implications, such as direct procurement, lack of essential elements in tenders, significant increases in the original length and/or size of contracts, increases without limitation of duration and/or size, or quality/price weights, which have reduced price competition.
The Institute had also identified the organisations involved in the procurement procedures of a KIC legal entity, and had drawn up an action plan to improve the procurement procedures of all KIC legal entities in the future.
Despite the substantial increase in the budget from EUR 309 million (2008-2013) to EUR 2.4 billion (2014-2020) and despite the fact that there have been six KICs since the end of 2016, and no longer three KICs, the number of posts approved to the Institute has hardly changed (see Table 2).
As the Court noted in its Special Report No 4/2016 (9), there is a risk that the Institute will not have sufficient capacity to address the increased workload.
The interim director of the institute pointed to this risk in the annual report of the institute for 2015.
Year of adoption of the correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/n.e.) 2016 In the course of 2016 Outstanding (not under the supervision of the Institute) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (9) Since 2016, administrative costs have been capped in the grant agreements.
The need for budgetary resources for 2016 was overestimated by EUR 13.1 million and 5.0 % respectively (2015: EUR 25 million and 9.4%), so that only EUR 249.9 million of the available EUR 263 million were committed.
The unused funds can be entered in the 2017-2019 budget.
The EIT financed an average of 90% of the costs reported by the KICs under the 2015 grant agreements.
The amounts collected by the KICs from different sources represented 2.5% of the funds requested by the EIT.
Special Report No 4/2016: The European Institute of Innovation and Technology must change its implementation mechanisms and some conceptual elements in order to deliver the expected impact.
The EIT continues to interpret the EIT Regulation differently, as set out in its response to the 2015 report.
In 2016, universities received an average of 17 000 euros per year and student on the basis of the model described, which is based on a combination of actual costs and flat rates. The model was established for the first time at the end of 2016 and will be applied from 2017.
In 2016 (2015 financial assistance framework), the EIT reimbursed EUR 410 000 for this order.
The leadership position was occupied in February 2018.
In June 2018, the Commission initiated the recruitment procedure for the post of Director.
Special Report No 4/2016: The European Institute of Innovation and Technology must change its implementation mechanisms and some conceptual elements to deliver the expected impact.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/73 REPLY OF THE INSTITUTE 3.9.7.
The EIT would like to make it clear that changes to the individual grant agreements pursuant to the KIC Framework Partnership Agreements of the EIT can be submitted at any time during the period.
The amendments of the KICs were subject to a technical and financial assessment by the EIT and prior approval by the European Commission.
The changes were subsequently signed in December 2016.
In the case of EIT Climate-KIC, the KIC was formally notified of the approval of the amendment application on 21 December 2016 (i.e. within the period of application).
Regarding the increase in individual reimbursements, the EIT points out that no additional amount of financial assistance was paid out to KICs as a result of the changes to the individual financial assistance agreements in 2016.
The total amount of the final financial assistance (241.8 million euros) was significantly lower than the initial amount (274.9 million euros).
As regards the call for KICs to develop their own sources of financing and to become financially viable, we refer to our response to section 3.9.15.
In the context of the assessment of the amendments, the EIT, after consultation with the European Commission, concluded that the adjustment of the individual reimbursements complies with the applicable legal basis and does not affect the equal treatment of KICs.
The possibility of adjusting the individual refund rates was open to all KICs on equal terms.
As regards the second observation, the EIT considers that the amendments complied with Article 180(4) of the Financial Regulation's implementing provisions, since they did not call into question the decisions on the award of grants and did not run counter to equal treatment of applicants.
It should be noted that there is no provision for a materiality threshold that shows which change of a measure is to be considered as significant when assessing whether the change is relevant for the grant.
Whether the inclusion of new activities corresponds to that provision must be determined on a case-by-case basis on the basis of the relevance and impact of the activities for the entire KIC business plan.
The EIT carried out the assessment before the approval of the change plans and came to the conclusion that the changes did not call into question the decisions on the award of grants.
Since each KIC had the power to include new and new activities in its changed businesses on equal terms, the equal treatment of KIC was also ensured.
Finally, the EIT points out that, in the case of EIT InnoEnergy, the only activity that could be considered was only 3.9% of the modified budget estimate of the KIC's business plan.
For EIT Digital, this share was 0.6%.
3.9.10.
3.9.12.
The updated versions of the contingency plan and the plan for re-launching following a system breakdown will be adopted by the EIT in 2018.
3.9.13.
The 2016 individual financial assistance agreements with EIT Health and EIT RawMaterials were signed more recently than planned, as the framework partnership agreements had to be signed first.
The individual financial assistance agreements for 2017 and 2018 were systematically signed in February, so that the KICs could start their activities in good time in the respective year.
Due to their dynamic and fast-moving nature, innovative measures cannot be planned linearly.
Some innovation projects or projects do not meet the expectations of their potential and must be discontinued during the implementation of the grant agreements. Moreover, some of the operational activities of the KICs, such as master's and doctoral studies or long-term research and innovation projects, are planned from the ground up for several years.
The EIT intends to address this issue after 2020 by entering into multiannual grant agreements with KICs, provided the EIT budget allocates corresponding appropriations for commitments in multi-annual tranches.
In fact, the EIT has followed the methodology laid down in the legal basis ăHorizont 2020 and will continue to comply with current legislation.
The financial sustainability of KIC is a unique ambition of the EIT-KIC model and one of the most difficult aspects of the EIT's mission.
In the meantime, some of the innovation communities can already have a substantial co-financing, which they can do, and generate considerable revenue compared to their budgets.
EIT Digital has co-financed 26% (22 million euros) to pay the costs for the 2016 KIC value added activities. In addition, the partner organisations carried out and paid additional KIC activities of more than 200 million euros.
Another example is EIT Health: In its first operating year, KIC generated more than EUR 6 million in revenue compared to the total funding it had received from the EIT (around EUR 19 million).

COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.10.8.
In 2014, the Commission entered into a framework agreement with a contractor on the acquisition of software licenses and maintenance and support services on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the Agency).
The contractor of the framework agreement acts as intermediary between the agency and companies that can meet the needs of the agency.
For these intermediate services, the contractor of the framework agreement adds two to nine percent to the supplier prices. In 2017, the contractor of the framework agreement paid a total of 1.7 million euros.
The Agency did not systematically compare the calculated prices and discounts with the offers of the companies and did not systematically check the invoices issued to the contractor of the framework agreement. COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.10.9. The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
3.10.10.
In accordance with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (96) (97). Since a corresponding framework also applies for the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT overview covering all stages of public procurement procedures.
It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/77 EN ANNEX Follow-up of comments from previous years Statements by the Court In 2014, the Agency concluded a six-year framework agreement worth EUR 3.5 million for the acquisition of goods and services in the IT sector.
The agency supported the demand and the expected order value, which meant that the contract had been phased out to 80% at the end of 2016.
Four years earlier than expected, a new procurement procedure has to be launched, resulting in additional administrative costs.
In 2016, the Agency completed seven framework contracts for the acquisition of pollution control systems.
Each framework contract (one lot in the procurement procedure) referred to a particular execution.
The award procedure was initiated in the assumption that the total value of the seven framework contracts would be EUR 7 million.
However, this assumption supported the needs of the agency, and seven framework contracts were signed for a total of EUR 7 million each, which resulted in a total value of EUR 49 million.

EN C 434/78 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.10.8.
The Agency will remind the responsible project representatives to consistently carry out the necessary checks on the prices charged by the provider and/or to check whether the correct deadlines are applied.
EMSA will also ask the leading public contracting authority in this framework agreement to ask the contractor regularly to always attest to the market price/addition when responding to offer requirements.
3.10.9.
Following a court decision, the EPSO decided that only job advertisements in the official languages of the EU or in the languages indicated in the Agency's legislation can be published on the EPSO website.
Because of the high translation costs of this new policy (about EUR 19000 per advertised post), EMSA and many other agencies no longer use EPSO services in their job advertisements.
This point was raised in December 2015 by some agencies against the EPSO.
EMSA would like to see a solution that would provide both sufficient transparency and comply with the principle of sound financial management.
The Agency strives to promote its job advertisements to a broad audience by distributing them on various social media used by many people.
It should be noted that most of EMSA's job advertisements are addressed to technical professionals who regularly access the EMSA website.
In 2017, EMSA made extensive preparations for adapting all internal procedures to the use of e-procurement.
EMSA is able to confirm that it has been introducing the modules for electronic procurement since the beginning of 2018.
The deadline for the use of e-procurement by EU bodies is October 2018.

EXTERNAL EVALUATION REPORT 3.11.11.
In 2017, an external evaluation of the Agency's performance was carried out on behalf of the Commission in the period 2013-2016 (106).
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.11.12. The annex gives an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
(106) The court did not carry out this work.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/81 (1) According to ENISA, the number of employees was reduced to 11 at the end of 2017. Year 2015 2016 Statement of correction (completed/in progress/outstanding/ n.e.z.) In progress n. z. z. DE ANNEX Follow-up of observations from previous years Statements by the Court The Agency plans to transfer the administrative staff from Heraklion to Athens in 2016.
The rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year is high for Title II (administrative expenditure) at EUR 0.3 million and 25% (2015: EUR 0.15 million and 22%).
This high rate is mainly due to transfers of funds for Title I (staff expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) and is mainly related to IT investments made shortly before the end of the year and the acquisition of a service car.
As foreseen in the Agency's financial rules, external evaluations of the Agency's performance for 2014 and 2015 were carried out; the final reports were submitted in October 2015 and May 2016 respectively.
The 2014 evaluation concluded that the operational core competences undertaken under the 2014 work programme are clearly related to the Agency's legal mandate and that the Agency's effectiveness has been well assessed.
However, there was a need for improvement in the division of the agency between Heraklion and Athens, which is leading to heavy workloads and a lack of communication and cooperation.
The 2015 evaluation concluded that the Agency's activities and outputs meet a need for network and information security throughout the EU and in the Member States and that the Agency effectively meets the expectations of its stakeholders.
However, the report stressed that the communication between the Agency and its stakeholders, whose view is that the mandate and reach of the Agency are too limited, needs to be improved.
The Agency is currently implementing an action plan which it has subsequently agreed with the Management Board.
In 2016, the Agency moved eight more employees to Athens, reducing the number of employees in Heraklion to 14 (1).
As the Court pointed out in its 2013 report, costs could probably be further reduced by pooling the entire staff at one location.
EN C 434/82 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.11.8.
The transfer to the new invoicer was never formalized, but informal meetings with the former current invoicer took place to pass on knowledge.
The new accountant also received an updated training on SAP to ensure a good understanding of the accounting system.
Nevertheless, ENISA will take corrective measures to ensure an adequate transfer between outgoing and new staff.
3.11.9.
All vacancies published by the EPSO must be translated into all official EU languages.
In view of its limited budget, ENISA is unfortunately unable to bear these costs.
However, the Agency uses traditional and social media and has pledged its cooperation in the creation of an agency-wide portal to reduce the risks associated with the publication of job offers, as many of the decentralised institutions face the same problem.
ENISA has not carried out a formal operational and financial impact assessment of Brexit, since it has no significant direct impact on the budget, operation and administration of ENISA.
However, internal procedures (i.e. procurement and recruitment) were revised in the context of Brexit.

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.12.8.
In December 2016, the Agency's accountant was appointed interim manager of the Financial and Procurement Department in addition to this function.
In the context of this additional function, it is responsible for the management of the staff, which is responsible for initiating and supervising commitments and payments.
The financial rules of the Agency stipulate that those financial operators are under the authority of the authorising officer.
However, according to the principle of separation of duties, powers of instruction and accounting are separate functions and exclude each other.
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the Agency) with a contractor on the acquisition of IT hardware and software as well as maintenance and support services (IT services).
In case of a paid payment of around 47 000 euros, the agency had acquired IT services from the contractor without any competitive process or prior market analysis. In 2017, payments to the contractor in total amounted to 1.1 million euros.
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.12.10.

This could also facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive siting agreement with the Member State in which the Agency is based, so that the conditions under which the Agency and its staff would operate would be clarified.

Without questioning its judgment, the Court points out that the United Kingdom notified the European Council on 29 March 2017 of its decision to withdraw from the European Union.
An agreement on the details of the withdrawal is currently being negotiated.
The budget of the budget is 27% financed by the European Union, 42% by direct contributions from the EU Member States and 29% by contributions from the supervised institutions (rating agencies and trade repositories). The other 2% comes from other sources.

EPSO has decided to publish ESMA's job advertisements on its website only if the job advertisements are available in 24 languages.
In 2017, the translation costs to be borne by ESMA (five job advertisements of 16) amounted to 32 431 euros.
ESMA considers that the costs of translating all job vacancies into 23 languages are not justified in terms of economic budget management and has therefore decided to use other media in which the majority of EU agencies publish their job vacancies.

COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.14.9.
The appropriations carried over for Title II (administrative expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) were at 40% for each title or a total of EUR 3.5 million, which is in contradiction with the budgetary principle of annuality.
There is no indication that the appropriations carried over are linked to expenditure planned during the budgetary procedure.
For example, in December 2017, the agency ordered IT equipment and B
In line with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform format for electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (123) (124). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT summary, covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
The Agency had not introduced any of these tools by the end of 2017.

C 434/92 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 2016 2016 Outstanding In progress DE ANNEX Follow-up of observations from previous years Court observations At EUR 417 279 or 30 % (2015: EUR 364 740 or 26 %), the rate of committed appropriations for the financial year 2017 was high for Title II (administrative expenditure).
These transfers mainly concern IT services which had not yet been fully provided or invoiced at the end of the year.
The committed appropriations for Title III for the following financial year amounted to EUR 3370616 and 43% respectively (2015: EUR 3383052 and 41%).
These transfers mainly concern research projects and studies with a duration of more than one year.
In 2014, the Agency concluded a framework agreement on IT consulting for the period 2014-2017 on a total amount of 1.1 million euros.
Although a clear definition of project performance was made in the individual contracts signed in 2016 for the implementation of the framework agreement, consultants were required on the basis of time and resources. The price is not fixed and directly linked to the performance, but is based on the number of working days worked.
In addition, in 2016, around 50% of IT consulting services were provided outside the Agency's premises, so that the Agency was only able to monitor the efficient implementation of the facilities only to a limited extent.
In 2016, payments made according to the provisions of this framework agreement amounted to around 0.4 million euros.
The Agency's advisory decree does not explicitly require external evaluations of its activities.
The Commission's proposal for a new regulation provides for an evaluation to be carried out every five years. Year 2016 Progress of corrective action (completed/in progress/outstanding/n.e.) In progress (not under the control of the Agency)
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/93 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.14.8.
From organizational reasons the accountant is assigned in the organization chart to the resource and service center, whereby he spends his time in the services of the financial personnel.
The accountant, however, is directly subordinated to the Director (not the Head of the Resource and Service Centre) in order to ensure his independence.
3.14.9.
The transfers of Title III relate mainly to large-scale research projects with a duration of more than one year and are linked to the annual work programme 2017.
The transfers under Title II concern primarily services, for which there are contracts with a duration of two calendar years.
With regard to the amount of 0.2 million euros, it should be noted that since 2014 the volume of funds for Title II and the Agency's move to new premises, which led to savings of 0.6 million euros per year, has been reduced to 1.4 million euros.
In 2017, the budget of Title II was further reduced by EUR 60 000 by an amending budget adopted in June, which is due to a reduction in the contribution of local authorities to the EU-OSHA infrastructure budget.
The majority of the procurements for IT equipment in question were planned for 2018 (and documented as such in the 2017 draft budget and in further budgeting phases), but the necessary commitments (100 000 euros) were finally made in 2017 as a means of implementation.
As of the 2019 budget, a list of possible additional IT procurements will be added to the programming document, provided that, for example, funds are available due to ongoing renegotiation of prices.
The transfer between the titles (including the provisions of the framework financial regulation) has been notified to the Board of Directors, the Parliament and the Council.
3.14.10.
Since the end of 2016, the Agency has been giving electronic access to all procedures initiated via its website (ex-ante announcements of low- or medium-value items and contract announcements), with special e-mail addresses being provided for the award of public contracts.
2018 (target: October) the Agency will introduce the electronic call tool for the publication and processing of information requests until the submission of tenders.
The Agency has now carried out an analysis of the possible impact of Brexit on its organisation, operations and accounting.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.15.8.
In the course of this annual review of EU agencies, the Court analysed the accounting system, including the hierarchical position and independence of its auditors.
At the foundation, the head of the Department of Administration and Finance is the head of the accountant.
The agencies should establish a single framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (129) (130). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT summary covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the Commission, by the end of 2017, the Foundation had introduced electronic invoicing and electronic tendering for certain procedures, but not the electronic submission of tenders.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS 3.15.10. The appendix gives an overview of the corrective measures taken as a result of the Court's observations from previous years.

C 434/96 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Observations of the Court In its report on the 2014 annual accounts, the Court noted that employees were too low for the period 2005-2014, which was related to the transition to the new EU Staff Regulations in 2005.
Although the under-restrictions have different dimensions (2014: non-compliance with the guaranteed minimum requirements; 2015: application of a false multiplication factor to the beneficiaries), the Court once again found too low (43350 euros) as well as some over-reacts (168930 euros) affecting 30 active and earlier employees.
Eurofound rectified all too low fees, but will not call for the higher fees (in accordance with Article 85 of the current Staff Regulations).
The Foundation should re-examine the errors that may have arisen as a result of the transition to the 2005 Staff Regulations and carry out a comprehensive evaluation of its payroll.
In its December 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed the need for the Foundation to improve its project management, in particular with regard to governance, monitoring and reporting.
The Foundation and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
At 2.8 million euros or 43% (2015: 2.1 million euros or 31%), the rate of committed appropriations transferred to 2016 rose to Title III (operational expenditure), which was mainly due to year-long projects (studies and pilot trials).
The Foundation may adopt separate budgets in order to better accommodate the multi-annual nature of the activities and the inevitable distortions between contract signings, deliveries and payments.
In the Foundation's regulations, external evaluations of their activities are not strictly prescribed.
The Commission proposal for a new regulation provides for an evaluation to be carried out every five years.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/97 REPLY OF THE FOUNDATION 3.15.8.
The Board of Directors is satisfied with the current independence of the Auditor, in particular with regard to his existing power to report directly to the Chair in accordance with Article 6.1 of the Charter of the Auditor, and with regard to the Board's participation in the appointment process.
However, a new regulation, which is currently being drawn up between the institutions, is likely to assign the role of the employment authority to the Board of Directors rather than to the Director.
Eurofound is thus able to reassess the question of the greater independence of the accountant in the future.
3.15.9.
However, two pilot agencies have had serious problems with the software.
Furthermore, the software for electronic procurement is currently only available for open tenders (but not for tenders under the negotiated procedure), of which Eurofound has very few per year.
Therefore, Eurofound will continue to follow developments and is ready to invest in electronic procurement once it is satisfied with its stability and functionality.

AGENCY FOR EUROPEAN GNSS (GLOBAL SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM) (GSA) INTRODUCTION 3.16.1.
The Agency for the European GNSS (global satellite navigation system) (hereinafter referred to as the Agency), whose seat was moved from Brussels to Prague on 1 September 2012, was created by Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (132) repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 (133) on the administrative bodies of the European satellite navigation programmes and amending Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(134).
The European GNSS Advisory Board, set up under Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, officially took over on 1 January 2007 all the tasks previously entrusted to the Galileo Joint Undertaking. e Agency continues to carry out these tasks as an agency for the European GNSS on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, as amended.
The Commission also entrusted the Agency with the operation of the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) by means of a transfer agreement.

Emphasis on a situation 3.16.7.
On 15 December 2016, the Agency concluded a framework agreement worth EUR 1.5 billion on the operation of the Galileo satellite system during the period 2017-2027.
The agreement was awarded following a public procurement procedure.
One of the tenderers involved brought proceedings against the Agency before the Court of Justice of the European Union in order to challenge the outcome of the award procedure.
The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union will decide on the legality and regularity of the procurement procedure for the framework agreement and all associated individual contracts and future payments.
The Agency reported the situation in the 2017 annual accounts and explained that in 2017 49 million euros (7 % of the 2017 budget including the amounts received by the transfer agreements) were paid out in connection with the framework agreement.
Note 3.16.8.
Negotiations on an agreement on the details of the withdrawal are under way.
The Agency operates both the Galileo Security Centre (GSMC) and Galileo ground stations in the United Kingdom.
In the annual accounts, the Agency refers to the Commission's decision, adopted on 24 January 2018, to move the second location of the Galileo Security Centre (GSMC) from the United Kingdom to Spain in the chapter ăEvents after the closing date.
3.16.9.
COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.16.10.
The Agency's headquarters were relocated and its mission was redefined in 2013.
In 2014, the Agency revised its financial regulations and delegated its accounting function to the Commission's accounting officer in 2015.
Although these events resulted in significant changes in the Agency's procedures, the accounting system has not been validated again since 2012 (138).
(138) See also the 2015 follow-up note.
EN C 434/100 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.16.11. The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
3.16.12.
In line with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform solution for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (139) (140). As a requirement also applies for the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT comprehensive package covering all stages of public procurement procedures.
It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic call for tenders in the online edition of the EU Official Journal (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
The Agency did not use any of these tools at the end of 2017.
EXTERNAL EVALUATION REPORT 3.16.13.
In 2017, a mid-term evaluation of the Galileo (141) and EGNOS programmes and the Agency's performance in 2014-2016 was carried out on behalf of the Commission (142).

(142) The Court did not overrule this evaluation work.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/101 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Court comments The property, plant and equipment (net book value: EUR 1.0 million) are not insured.
The accounting systems were last validated in 2012.
The agreed validation of the systems has not taken place due to the expected substantial changes in the procedures and the flow of information after the relocation of the agency.
The new accountant plans the next validation for 2020.
The Agency has set up Emergency Continuity Plans for security sites in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
However, there is no emergency plan for the headquarters in Prague and the agency as a whole.
The Agency's annual work plan for 2015 was adopted only in March 2015, and the adoption of its multiannual work programme 2014-2020 is still pending.
The late adoption of central planning documents carries risks for the achievement of the Agency's objectives.
In 2015, the agency had a high staff turnover with 14 retired and 26 new employees.
In its November 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that no agency-wide annual risk assessment was carried out in 2016 and that the significant risks for the Agency are not identified in its planning documents or in its activity reports.
In addition, the IAS noted that the terminology used for the various elements of the performance measurement system is not uniform, which makes performance monitoring more difficult.
The Agency and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures. At 2.8 million euros and 46% (2015: 2.5 million euros and 42%), the rate of committed appropriations for Title II (administrative expenditure) for the following financial year was high.
EN C 434/102 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.16.10.
The GSA agrees with the Court's comment.
In 2015, the GSA outsourced its accounts to the European Commission, so that the Commission's invoicing officer (within the DG Budget) provided all the services, including the validation of local systems, required under Article 50 of the framework financial regulation applicable to the agencies.
The validation approach is currently being worked out and planned within DG Budget services.
3.16.11.
Publicising job advertisements on the EPSO platform requires translation into all EU official languages, whereas English is the Agency's only working language and publication of vacancies in English is considered a first step in preselection to ensure that our working language is first understood.
In addition, the translation of job advertisements into all EU official languages would mean an additional financial and time-consuming effort for the agency, so that it doesn't derive any benefit from the above reasons. Instead, the GSA intends to publish all job advertisements on the agency's cross-border portal, which the agencies consider equivalent to the EPSO and offers the EU citizens a sufficient amount of transparency.
In addition, the agency also publishes its job advertisements on specialized space websites.
Electronic communications in TED (published by the Office for Publications) are currently used in the GSA for the publication of contract notices, award notices, notices on corrections, modification notices, etc. whenever this is indicated in accordance with Article 264 of the applicable provisions.
The Agency also intends to use the e-Tendering system TED to create and publish tenders.
Against this background, GSA is currently coordinating with the Office for Publications to register and create a system account.
With regard to offers of high value (above the thresholds of Article 118(1) HO), the GSA is currently undertaking the necessary administrative steps to use the ăe Submission module of the information system ăe-PRIOR (presented by DG DIGIT) developed by the European Commission to ensure that the electronic system set up for the submission of all offers meets all the requirements of the HO and AB.
It is pointed out that the module ăe-Submission is currently supported exclusively by open procedures and the GSA is therefore allowed to use it only for such procedures.
In this context, the GSA has already held an initial coordination meeting with DG DIGIT and is about to finalise and sign an agreement with it to define the framework for ăe Submission and start implementing it.

COMMENTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE CURRENCY 3.17.8.
In the course of this year's review of EU agencies, the Court analysed the accounting system, including the hierarchical position and independence of its auditors.
The head of the Agency's accountant is the head of administrative services.
COMMENTS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.17.9. The EEA noted that one of the European Topic Centres (ETZs) implemented the Action Plan for 2016 with significant reductions.
It therefore did not accept some of the results and rejected part of the costs claimed by the ETZ.
The correction of the amount of the final payment also shows that the financial and performance controls on the grants granted to the ETZ have been further improved.
3.17.10.
In several procurement procedures, a number of angels have been identified.
The Agency used service descriptions for several calls for proposals, which did not include minimum economic and financial performance requirements for the selection criteria.
On the basis of these criteria, contrary to their objective, -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.17.11.
The price competition in some high-value tenders was based solely on the daily hours offered for certain profiles and not on the expected time taken to complete the tasks.
Framework agreements were concluded with only one tenderer, although a renewed call for competition between different bidders would lead to better results in terms of individual bidders.
3.17.12.
The agencies should establish a common framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (147) (148). Given that a corresponding requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT package covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
3.17.13.
In particular, the decisions taken in the minutes of the selection committee were not sufficiently detailed.
The criteria used in the various stages of the selection procedure and the role of the individual members of the selection committee must be more precisely defined in order to improve the transparency and equal treatment of applicants.

The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Office for Personnel Selection (EPSO), which would increase transparency and publicity and enable the citizens to consult job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies. The main reason given by the Agency is the high translation costs for EPSO publications for which translations must be made into all the official languages of the EU.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.17.15.
In order to implement the Copernicus transfer agreement concluded with the Commission, the Agency entered into several legal obligations linked with Copernicus before receiving pre-financing from the Commission.
Although an exceptional report was signed by the Agency's director, this procedure is contrary to the provisions of the Financial Regulation.
CONTINUE REFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.17.16. The annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken by the Court on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
C 434/106 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Court observations In 2016, the Agency updated its security concept, but many of its other internal procedures are outdated.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) subjected the procedures for drawing up the 2015 State of the Environment Report (SOER) to a cost-effectiveness assessment.
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement with a contractor on the acquisition of software and licenses and related IT maintenance and advisory services on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the Agency).
In 2016, the Agency used this framework agreement to acquire software licenses worth a total of 442 754 euros.
The largest order concerned the renewal of software licenses provided by an exclusive Scandinavian buyer (112 248 euros).
In this case, the use of the framework agreement, which led to unnecessarily delays, was not justified. Year 2016 2016 State of acceptance of correction (completed/in progress/outstanding/ n.e.c.) Completed n.e.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/107 REPLY OF THE AGENCY OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.17.8. The Agency has commented on the Court's comment with regard to the invoice and is convinced that the functional independence is due to the fact that the invoicer is a staff member who is classified at a high grade (AD 12) and has direct access to the Board of Directors.
COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY ASSURANCE AND SERVICES 3.17.9.
The Agency welcomes the fact that the Court wishes to further improve its management of the ETZ in terms of both financial and operational controls.
In order to remedy a repeat of the problem encountered by the ETZ in 2017 in terms of inland, coastal and marine waters, the task was taken out of the annual action plan and transferred to the Agency.
The Agency is committed to maintaining the current level of control of grants granted to the ETZ.
The Agency confirms that it has changed the requirements relating to the financial performance of bidders in the course of 2017 and that the bidders are now required to provide information on financial indicators (liquidity, solvency and profitability); furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 147(1)(a) of the Rules of Application (AB), a minimum turnover is now required which must be at least twice the value of the estimated annual contract value.
The Agency would like to stress once again that the decision to offer framework contracts to individual contractors has been taken, aware and taking into account the fact that competition is limited to the relevant markets, as well as the nature and complexity of the services to be provided.
In the allocation of individual assignments on the basis of the framework contracts, the Agency takes into account not only the contractually agreed days, but also the number of days required for the execution of the tasks, in order to calculate a value for the budget, which must be set for a specific individual assignment.
Only then will negotiations be opened with the contractor on the details of his offer, always taking care to achieve the best price-performance ratio.
In the event of a reopening of the tender, the Agency has no control over any further negotiations about the tenderers' bids.
In line with the decision of the Board of Directors of 9 November 2015 to establish in the EEA an electronic invoicing system for procurement procedures, the Agency introduced certain procedures for electronic invoicing in the course of 2014 and is now in the process of extending the application of this module to all its procedures, whereas the electronic tendering system has been in force since 1 January 2015 for all general invitations to tender.
The integration of the electronic submission of tenders was started at the beginning of December 2017, and the first call for tenders in which this module was used was launched on 18 June 2018 (EEA/COM/18/002 ).
The Agency takes note of the Court's remark and confirms that it is currently adapting its selection/ recruitment procedures to the following points: a) The completion of the individual steps in the various stages (pre-selection, selection, interview and written examination) is confirmed in the relevant documents in addition to the time (not only with the date). b) An electronic (paperless) procedure is introduced in order to improve the reporting process.
3.17.14.
The EPSO has rejected a publication for the agency with the recognition that the precondition that all job offers are to be translated into all official languages is not fulfilled.
However, the Agency does not have the resources or resources to respond to the request of the EPSO.
In this case, not only all job offers should be translated, but also the applications should be processed in all official languages, which entails unsustainable additional costs.
As with most other EU agencies, the Agency has therefore looked for an alternative to the EPSO website and has been using a website that fulfils the same purpose since May 2018 for its announcements; it is the Job Advertisement Board set up and maintained by the network of EU agencies.
In addition, the agency uses LinkedIn, its own website and Facebook pages to ensure the best possible distribution.
EN C 434/108 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY FOOD 3.17.15.
Before concluding the transfer agreement for Copernicus with DG GROW, the Agency subsequently pointed out that the conditions for pre-financing are not compatible with the financial regulation (Article 7 AR of the 2014 Financial Regulation).
First, DG GROW expressed its understanding in its reply, but DG BUDG, which is responsible for drawing up the standard template, refused to change the transfer agreement.
After the implementation of the transfer agreement began, the Agency continued to point out the problems and stated that it was normally forced to apply exceptions in order to continue its operational activity; this led DG GROW to change the pre-financing conditions of the transfer agreement in August 2017 and to make additional pre-financing in November 2017.

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.19.8.
The Agency delegated its accounting function to the Commission's invoicing officer in 2014.
In addition, the Agency's headquarters were relocated in 2014 and its mission was redefined in 2016.
Although these events led to changes in the procedures of the Agency, the accounting system has not been validated again since 2013.
In December 2016, the Agency concluded a framework agreement with an economic operator with a value of 1.6 million euros and a term of four years on the provision of temporary jobs.
The only competition criterion in the procurement procedure was the price.
A framework agreement with several companies selected on the basis of price and quality criteria would have been better in terms of timely provision of high-quality services.
3.19.10.
On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom informed the European Council of its decision to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit).
3.19.11.
The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which would increase transparency and publicity and enable the citizens to consult job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies.
3.19.1.12.
In the context of its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (160) (161). Given that a corresponding requirement is also applicable for the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an overall IT framework covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.19.13.
In 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service presented a review report on the needs assessment, planning and budgeting of training measures at the Agency (162).
The Agency drew up an action plan to take remedial action in areas where there is a potential need for improvement.

CEPOL agrees with the Court's comment.
In 2014, CEPOL outsourced its accounts to the European Commission, so that the Commission's accounting officer (within the budget DG) will provide all the services, including the validation of local systems, required under Article 50 of the framework financial regulation applicable to the agencies.
The validation approach is currently being developed and planned within DG Budget services.
3.19.9.
The Agency has taken note of the Court's observations but does not share its opinion.
The quality criteria were included in the technical specifications and the bidders who failed to meet the criteria had to be excluded.
The decision to award a single framework contract is based on previous experiences and specific features of the national labour market.
The Agency has taken note of the Court's observations.
The Brexit was closely followed in meetings of the executives; the discussions in the NAPO (agency-wide network of procurement officers) and in the IALN (agency-wide legal network) as well as the communications sent by the Commission.
The risks for CEPOL were assessed as low but not officially documented.
The estimated costs for the translation of job advertisements into all EU official languages, as required for publication on the EPSO website, are considered too high given the expected benefits.
From 2018, CEPOL will also publish all vacancies on the agency's cross-cutting job market, which was developed by the network of EU agencies.
The Agency has taken note of the Court's observations and confirmed that progress is being made in introducing the electronic submission of tenders in cooperation with DG DIGIT.
3.19.13.
The Agency notes that progress has been made in the implementation of the Action Plan, with two out of four recommendations assessed as being implemented by the Internal Audit Service.

EUROPEAN SUPPORT FOR ASYLUM (EASO) INTRODUCTION 3.20.1.
The European Asylum Support Office (hereinafter referred to as "the B" or "EASO") based in Valletta was established by Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (163) to promote practical cooperation in the field of asylum and to support Member States in fulfilling their European and international obligations to protect vulnerable people.
Since 2015, the B'ro has supported Greece and Italy in the context of the migration crisis.

According to our assessment, the annual accounts of the company for the year ending 31 December 2017 constitute the annual and financial position of the company for the year ending 31 December 2017, the results of its accounts and cash flows and the changes in net assets for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 in agreement with its financial regulations and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, which are based on internationally recognized accounting grounds for the public sector, in all essential respects.

Payments Basis for the failure of the ruling on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.20.6.
Paragraphs 3.20.9-3.20.31 describe essential and systematic commitments against the financial regulations of the bank, as well as other rules and provisions relating to payments. Payments made in connection with procurement and recruitment procedures were particularly affected.
The cumulative error due to the irregular payments concerns at least 7.7 million euros and 10.3% of the total payments made by the company in 2017.
Judicial judgment on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts 3.20.7.
In our opinion, the payments underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 due to the significance of the facts described in the ăBase for the failed judgment regarding the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts are in material detail.
Emphasis on a situation 3.20.8.
From the end of 2017, the personnel situation at the B的ro deteriorated exponentially.
At management level, four out of ten Head of Unit posts and 18 out of 27 Head of Division posts were not filled.
Three out of four Head of Unit posts and five out of ten Head of Division posts were not filled in the ăVerwaltung's department, which represents a serious challenge for the leadership level of the team.
Furthermore, at the end of May 2018, 129 posts were filled for temporary staff, but 78 were still open.
Of the posts of contract staff, 71 were occupied and 13 were still open.
The B sucho currently does not have the administrative capacity to fill so many vacancies (see Table 2).
On the whole, the continuation of the activities of the B such as this is largely due to this situation.
EN C 434/118 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Table 2 Organizational chart of the European Union beginning of June 2018
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/119 COMMENTS ON LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ADMINISTRATIVEITY OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OF ENTERPRISES The nature of its activities gives rise to large risks for the company 3.20.9.
Since 2016, the B的ro has been faced with an unprecedented expansion of tasks and activities to provide operational and technical support to Member States in the context of the migration crisis.
This is reflected in an increase in budget appropriations from the original EUR 19 million in 2016 to EUR 79 million following the second change in the 2017 budget.
The number of award procedures increased from 87 in 2015 to 140 in 2017.
Payments increased by 225% from 2 578 in 2015 to 8 381 in 2017.
3.20.10.
The B-ro is one of the few institutions of the European Union which has several locations.
In addition to its headquarters in Malta, with 179 staff members, the agency manages two large-scale support activities in Greece and Italy, involving 747 experts from Member States and associated countries, 202 cultural intermediaries (interpreters), 178 temporary workers and 21 staff members of the agency.
3.20.11.
As the Court noted in its Special Report No. 6/2017 ăReaction of the EU to the refugee crisis: the Hotspot concept, the B
The efficiency of the activities is particularly stressed by the fact that Member States send their experts for a very short period of time (six to eight weeks).
The extraordinary operational challenge posed by the migration crisis was not weakened by a sound management structure and effective internal controls 3.20.12.
When Greece and Italy started to support their efforts in 2015, the bank was confronted with the fact that Member States provided insufficient resources for their deployments.
It had already made it difficult for the office to fill the posts set out in its establishment plan.
Since 2014, the court has regularly repeated its remark that the B的ro has to struggle with a high staff turnover.
In its previous annual reports, the Court repeatedly stressed that this situation represents a serious risk for achieving the objectives set out in the annual and multiannual work programmes.
Despite repeated attempts (36 recruitment procedures and 100 new assignments in 2017), the company has failed to recruit and maintain employees (see also paragraph 3.20.8).
3.20.13.
The extraordinary challenge in the operational area due to the migration crisis was not weakened by a solid management structure.
The Board of Directors did not set up an internal audit post at the company, and the actions in Greece and Italy were not subject to an internal audit.
By the end of 2017, the Board of Directors had limited oversight of the budget.
3.20.14.
In the case of the B有ro, neither an internal legal service is established nor legal documents are systematically implemented internally.
The Bureau distributes most of the legal questions (mainly personnel and procurement questions) to outside, without having clearly defined in internal decisions or guidelines, who can award which legal questions externally, to which law firm and under what conditions.
Although the B:ro uses at least eight different law firms, there is no comprehensive list of all relevant departments, cases and expert opinions.
3.20.15.
Legal services are not adequately handled by the company to ensure that they are exclusively used to defend the interests of the company and not to defend the interests of individuals.
The relevant procedures to protect against conflicts of interest are not always effective.
In general, the use of external means reduces the possibility of settling disputes before bringing an action.
3.20.16.
The facts set out in paragraphs 3.20.13-3.20.14 expose the bureau to the risk of financial losses and distortions of reputation.
These matters are currently being examined internally by the B:ro.
Many significant infringements of rules resulting from the lack of internal controls payments for auxiliary benefits 3.20.17.
In 2017, €7.7 million was paid for auxiliary services.
Since no competitive public procurement procedure had taken place, the Court found the order for auxiliary services in Greece to be contrary to the law in respect of the year 2016.
Nevertheless, in 2017 the company still made payments of EUR 4.8 million within the framework of this unlawful order.
EN C 434/120 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.20.18.
The procurement procedures for auxiliary services carried out in Malta in 2017 (volume of payments in 2017: EUR 1.0 million) were inadequate in their execution (e.g. short deadlines for the submission of tenders, lack of transparency in the extension of time limits), which was one of the most important reasons for the competition in public procurement procedures.
As a result, the procedures had to be repeated several times because no tenders were received.
3.20.19.
The services were insufficiently controlled for compliance with national regulations for temporary employment, which exposed the agency to significant financial and reputational risks.
Furthermore, the revision of working time certificates for temporary staff and established irregularities had considerable weaknesses.
Payments for staff expenditure 3.20.20.
The staff-related payments amounted to EUR 13.5 million in 2017. The Court found serious errors in four of the 14 recruitment procedures.
3.20.21.
For example, the B的ro did not publish a job advertisement to fill the post of senior consultant, but did the recruitment directly on the basis of a reserve list that had been prepared for the post of head of department.
The extension of the deadline was not always justified given the number of applications received by the original deadline.
3.20.22.
Some procedures for hiring AD staff were not appropriate for the advertised grade.
In a procedure for filling a management post in the ăVerwaltungstung (administrative department), the job advertisement was more restrictive than for the same posts in other departments.
In another procedure, the examination of the suitability of the applicants was not adequately documented by the B-ro.
Payments for rents and related works 3.20.23.
The total rent for all the bikes at the different locations amounted to two million euros in 2017.
The Court noted that the B的ro had signed the rental contract for the expansion of the headquarters in Malta and several new B suchos in Athens, Lesbos and Chios without having properly analysed the local market beforehand.
3.20.24.
In June 2017, the B sucho signed a lease agreement with B suchoflachen in Lesbos.
It also accepted a contract with the landlord - without any competition ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The value of the building contract (0.7 million euros during the first months of the rental contract) exceeded the annual value of the rental contract many times.
The investment of significant investments in rented buildings is accompanied by serious financial and operational risks.
3.20.25.
In 2018, the B sucho decided to contract a rental agreement with B suchoflachen in Chios and related construction services.
It is currently designed to limit the financial exposure to risk as a result of cancellation.
Payments for travel expenses 3.20.26.
The Court held an order for travel services to the value of 4 million euros for the year 2016 in violation of the law.
The contract was awarded to a bidder who did not meet all the selection criteria.
On the basis of this irregular order, the bank continued to make payments at an amount of 1.5 million in 2017.
3.20.27.
In 2017, the B sucho identified significant errors in the recognition of travel services, in particular the lack of evidence to demonstrate that the travel services concerned were actually requested or provided.
This matter is currently being examined internally by the Bureau.
Other payments 3.20.28.
In addition, other services such as cleaning services, security services, interpreting and consulting services, which were based on public procurement procedures, were systematically affected by the same rules.
The Court established considerable rules for the determination of needs for the purposes of the contract, the preparation of specifications, the choice of the type of contract, the award procedures applied, the time limits for the submission of tenders, the evaluation and award procedures (i.e. the weighting of the price criteria against the quality criteria), the changes and extensions of contracts, the execution of the contracts and the overhaul of the services provided.
These rules have an impact on the basic principles of competition, transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination of bidders.
The following digits contain some examples for the above mentioned angels.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/121 3.20.29.
In 2017, the B的ro awarded a service contract on advisory services related to the implementation of the Action Plan on the Greek islands.
The contract was awarded to a pre-selected economic operator without any of the procurement procedures provided for in the Financial Regulation being applied.
The procurement procedure and all related payments (EUR 992000) were therefore unlawful.
3.20.30.
Since then, the company has changed the original contract of EUR 5000 with a law firm in 2016 several times and increased it to EUR 259000 in 2018.
Payments of EUR 98332 in total were made to the contract in 2017, partly for consultancy services, which required a competitive public procurement procedure.
The changes and payments concerning these consultancy services were therefore contrary to the rules.
3.20.31.
The execution of the 2013 contract (value: 120 000 euros, 2017 raised to 132 000 euros) about the organisation of four to six large events in an international hotel for a period of four years was not in line with the original subject of the contract.
The club used the contract instead for about 50 smaller events.
The execution of the contract has therefore not taken place in accordance with the law.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY FOOD 3.20.32.
According to the agreements between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein (also referred to as associated countries) regarding their participation in the project, the associated countries are fully involved in the work of the project and are entitled to support measures of the project.
In 2016 the B-ro received financial assistance from the Commission to ensure adequate capacity building in Greece, to support the implementation of the declaration of the European Union and Turkey, and to substantially accelerate the redistribution in order to reduce the current high burden for Greece.
All these activities are part of the core business of the "B"ros, not the support of measures of common interest.
The B-ro used the financial assistance for payments (EUR 6.4 million in 2016 and EUR 1.7 million in 2017) of commitments made in connection with these activities.
However, it did not include these interests in the calculation of the contributions of the associated countries.
If these contributions were included, the associated countries would have to pay EUR 0.5 million more.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS 3.20.33. The appendix contains an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.

(2) In progress Outgoing In progress ANNEX Follow-up of observations from previous years Court observations 446 of all payments (18%) were made in accordance with the deadlines laid down in the financial regulation.
In the context of a decision by the Executive Director, participants in meetings organised by the Bureau will be classified in one of three categories (A, B or C) with a view to reimbursement.
The number of participants who were classified as recipients of refunds of the category ăA的 increased from 61% in 2013 to 69% in 2014.
Two of the three tenderers participating in a negotiated procurement procedure for the provision of travel services on the basis of a framework service contract worth EUR 4 million for the period 2016-2020 were invited to provide additional information on the same selection criteria.
The framework agreement and the 2016 payments based on this are therefore non-compliant, amounting to EUR 920 561.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/123 Court's comments A framework agreement with a duration of two months, worth 3.6 million euros, on relief payments in connection with the resolution of the migration crisis, was awarded directly by the Federal Republic of Germany in February 2016.
The framework contract was awarded to a pre-elected economic operator without any of the procurement procedures provided for in the EU Financial Regulation being applied. Therefore, the award is not in accordance with the relevant EU rules and the 2016 payments based on it at a rate of EUR 592 273 are contrary to the rules.
In August 2016, the B thero launched an open procedure (f-f-lots) to award a framework contract to meet its needs for cultural mediators/interpreters in various countries.
The total value of the framework contract for the four lots awarded and awarded (Lose 2-5) was 60 million euros over four years.
However, this contractor fulfilled the financial requirements of the selection criteria (annual turnover of EUR 1 million) only for two of the three previous years; for the other year an undertaking was concluded with a joint organisation, under which they put their turnover at the disposal of the contractor (equity loan).
At the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of 23 April 2015 and in the ten-point plan on migration adopted by the Foreign and Home Affairs Ministers on 20 April 2015, Member States were invited to ensure the collection of fingerprints for all migrants.
This required the purchase and subsequent donation to the Greek State of 90 fingerprint scanners and 90 compatible computers (equipment) 
However, there were no local officials of the branch to meet this demand. Moreover, the confirmation of the Greek authorities that the equipment was delivered to the hotspots in February and early March 2016 and given its intended purpose was not received until July 2017.

In its October 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) highlighted the lack of adequate planning of procurement procedures in relation to administrative expenditure and that there are weaknesses in both the monitoring of procedures and in the context of framework contracts.
In 2016, the B有ro faced various challenges in its operational environment, including not only the substantial increase in its budget and the expansion of its tasks, but also the significant increase in the number of proposals, the replacement of the accountant's post with several interim measures and the introduction of a paperless workflow system.
This considerably changed and unstable situation was not cushioned by the revalidation of the accounting system or by the introduction of a system for regular ex-post control of accounts.
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement with a supplier on the acquisition of software licenses and maintenance and support services on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the B-ros).
In 2016, a total of 534 900 euros were paid to the contractor of the framework contract.
On behalf of the Commission, the performance of the programme was evaluated externally during the period 2011-2014, for which the final report was presented in December 2015.
The B'ro is currently implementing an action plan on which it has agreed with the Board of Directors in view of its extended mandate. The final implementation report was scheduled for June 2017.

DE C 434/126 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE B
At the same time, the Court is grateful for the Court's appreciation of the difficult situation, in which the Court found itself during the period under review due to the enormous expansion of its tasks: it has also been charged with supporting Member States and contributing to the implementation of initiatives at EU level, including redistributing and explaining EU Turkey, increasing the budget, the exponential increase in payments and the increase in procurement procedures (both in terms of number and complexity).
On top of this, the company has to manage a large number of sites and numerous management positions (department heads, department heads, sector heads) are not filled.
In his reply, the Bureau will respond to some of the Court's observations, but as a whole it accepts the report and the findings contained in it.
3.20.6. and 3.20.13.
With regard to the systematic violations of the regulations in the B-ro, under the new leadership, the B-ro started with the introduction of the necessary steps to ensure that the observance of the regulations gained priority and became the central element of the culture and in the implementation of all its measures.
This includes objective, honest and open internal control, self-assessment.
The Court accepts the Court's finding that the surveillance structures and internal control structures responsible by the Court have not received the attention in the past that is necessary to ensure an adequate level of justice and order.
In this respect, too, it would like to see the structure and procedures set up for the systematic performance of lawfulness and orderliness (and correspondingly pr的zise and comprehensive reporting) as absolute priority under the new leadership.
3.20.6., 3.20.8. and 3.20.12.
The Court rightly underlines the fact that the staff situation in the country has deteriorated and is insufficient and that it is also an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal control system.
The current personnel situation is one of the main challenges in the context of the resolution of the angels identified by the Court in its comments, which can be seen to a large extent as a result of the lack of resources for structured and regular work.
The Committee directly addresses this problem and, on the basis of a sound recruitment plan leading to a need assessment, is urgently engaged in recruitment procedures to fill management posts and other important (operational and administrative) posts.
In addition, the office makes efforts in the area of employee satisfaction to solve the problem of staff turnover. Although it is important to bear in mind that the low correction coefficient plays an important role in this respect compared to the relatively high cost of living in Malta, the office acknowledges that more efforts must be made to improve employee satisfaction.
Some measures such as flexible work opportunities, improved internal communication and organisation of employee events have already been introduced.
3.20.9. and 3.20.19.
The Court gives a correct description of the difficulties and the rapid increase in financial transactions and procurement procedures, expressed in absolute figures.
These figures speak a clear language, but basically reflect the balances in finance and not adequate in awarding.
These figures do not take into account other facts and measures which add to the mandatory situation in the procurement sector, such as the following two aspects: the involvement of externally funded experts (Articles 204 and 287 of the Financial Regulations), which represent a high workload for the procurement sector.
In the coming years a further deterioration is to be expected in this respect, as the B-ro [medical] experts must be involved in the support of tasks related to medical information regarding countries of origin.
Market-specific difficulties and limitations connected with our geographical areas of activity.
In the Italian and Greek regions, conditions for a competitive market for the provision of services and products are not very good.
In addition, as a customer, the company is not typical of the order size of economic operators in Malta, as they usually lack the capacity to meet the requirements related to the larger subsidiaries of the company.
3.20.10.-3.20.12. and 3.20.19.
This characteristic is essential for the understanding of the verheltnism, when it comes to implementing functioning internal control structures.
It should also be noted that due to its operational capacity, its geographically wide area of operation and (as the Court rightly notes) the restrictions on the use of Member State experts, the company is dependent on contractors to an unusually large extent.
This is a factor which has the effect of multiplying the tasks associated with the procurement and financial sector (including decentralised financial actors) since, for Greece, Italy and Cyprus,
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/127 and for hotspots in Greece and Italy are required in each case specific distributions (leasing vertrege, cleaning, safety, water supply as well as irrevocable services e.g. on the provision of auxiliary and interpreting services).
In this case, too, staff have a crucial role to play, and the company is currently (in recognition of the multiplication factor due to its capacity as a multi-site agency) able to allocate the necessary resources to ensure overall accuracy and quality in the award and financial cycles, as well as legal and regulatory capacity and to have the decentralisation carried out by a consulting firm.
3.20.14, 3.20.15 and 3.20.16.
The B sucho acknowledges the need to have internal legal expertise, and accepts this need.
In addition, the Court agrees unreservedly with the finding that legal services must always strictly represent the interests of the Court and not the interests of individuals (which does not exclude each other).
The Bureau believes that the inclusion of external legal services has not been adequately controlled.
As the Court notes in its report, the internal investigations on this matter will continue and the results will be communicated to the Court.
3.20.17. and 3.20.26.
The B sucho accepts the comments.
These remedies were immediately initiated following the Court's finding of irregularity in its 2016 audit report (initiation of the Court's report in September 2017).
Unfortunately, however, in 2017 due to the time limits and the fact that the company replaced the contracts as soon as possible after the determination of their illegality, it actually came to payments from the contract.
3.20.18 and 3.20.19.
The Committee accepts the comments and reiterates that these problems can be seen as a result of the lack of resources and the shortcomings in internal control and management that the Court calls all in its report.
3.20.23.-3.20.25.
As the Court notes in its report, there is currently an internal investigation into this matter.
3.20.29.-3.20.31.
3.20.32.
The last paragraph of the report (43) has certain doubts as it executed its activity in 2016 in accordance with the agreements with DG BUDG.
The Bureau has consulted DG BUDG on this matter in order to clarify this matter again and will take immediate measures if DG BUDG should change its previously communicated position.

Completed (1) Completed (2) ANNEX Follow-up of observations from previous years Court's comments The Court noted various sources of transparency in the procurement procedures, such as the lack of a clear link with the Centre's annual work programme, insufficient support for the estimated contract value or the lack of a financial benchmark for assessing the tenderer's financial capacity.
In May 2015, the Interim Director of the Centre was appointed by a decision of the Management Board.
As of 31 December 2016, this vacancy exceeded the maximum period of one year by eight months provided for in the Staff Regulations.
This involved 15 other transitional arrangements for other staff.
In its October 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) pointed out that despite the Centre's ongoing efforts to strengthen its internal controls on procurement, there are still significant deficiencies in procurement.
The IAS concluded that the planning and monitoring of procurement procedures are weak and that procurement procedures are not always covered by the annual work programme or financing decision.
In addition, reference is made to the Court's report on the annual accounts 2015 of the Centre and to the findings concerning the transparency of procurement procedures.
The Centre and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
As in previous years, the rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year was high for Title III (operational expenditure) of 7.9 million euros and 41% (2015: 7.5 million euros and 42%).
The funds transferred were primarily linked to several-year projects in the fields of scientific advice (2.4 million euros), monitoring (1.3 million euros), public health training (1.4 million euros) and IT applications for public health (2.1 million euros).
The Centre may use separate budget resources to better accommodate the multi-annual nature of the activities, as well as inevitable delays between contract signings, deliveries and payments.
(1) (2) Following a selection procedure, the Interim Director was appointed Director in 2017.
The Centre has introduced new IT tools to improve planning and monitoring of procurement procedures.

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF ACCOUNTS 3.22.8.
The head of the Office's accountant is the head of the Administration/Corporate Services department.
In May 2017, on behalf of nine agencies participating in the open call for tenders, the Authority concluded three framework agreements in the cascade system covering a wide range of services.
Although agency-wide procurement procedures provide a good way to increase administrative efficiency, in the case of procurement procedures where the specific services to be provided are not known at the time of the call for tenders, framework agreements where competition is again called for for each individual contract are better suited to achieving a good cost-benefit relationship than framework agreements in the cascade system.
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.22.10.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service presented a 2017 audit report on the procedure for evaluating regulated products/the assessment phase for the approval of contraceptives (175).
The report is currently drawing up an action plan to address areas where there is a potential need for improvement.

EFSA welcomes the Court's unrestricted judgements on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the accounts.
3.22.8.
In order to ensure the independence of the accountant, the formal requirement set out in EFSA's financial regulations will be implemented by EFSA: The current account holder was appointed by the EFSA Board of Directors in 2008.
The accountant is under the responsibility of the Head of the BuS Department. In order to ensure the functional independence of the accounting officer in the procedures for performance assessment, the Head of the BuS Division acts as assessor and the Chairman of the Audit Committee as countersigned staff.
The accounting officer may be suspended at any time by the Management Board, either temporarily or definitively.
3.22.9.
There is no obligation to use the model of the individual invitations to tender on the question of individual invitations to tender for framework contracts awarded in the cascade system, and both models may be suitable according to the relevant scenario.
The EFSA considers that re-launched calls for standard services are more appropriate for competition and are used in EFSA's statistical services, systematic review of literature and target group research.
EFSA uses the cascade model in the fall when a long-term contract relationship is in the foreground.
In particular, in the case of the framework agreement for external inspection services, the main aim is (i) to ensure an appropriate understanding of EFSA's activities, (ii) a coherent approach and (iii) credibility at all administrative levels.
EFSA has control over the budget for proposals made by the contractor in the cascade system.
3.22.10.
EFSA will implement the Action Plan on the Evaluation of Regulated Products/Assessment Phase of the Authorisation of Slurry Control following the IAD exercise.

The following remarks do not call into question the Court's judgment. COMMENTS ON LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ORDER OF THE PROJECT 3.23.8.
At the end of the financial year 2017, the Institute was the defendant in four disputes relating to three procurement procedures brought before the Court by rejected bidders.
In each of these cases, the applicant applied for annulment of the award decision and for compensation.
The claim for compensation in these four cases amounts to EUR 700 000 or 9% of the Institute's annual budget.
According to the evaluation of the Institute's external lawyer, a reduction of EUR 75 000 (or 1% of the Institute's annual budget) was recorded to cover the expected losses.
The judgment of the Court of First Instance in each of these cases will determine the legality and regularity of the award procedures for these contracts and future payments.
In 2016, the Institute launched an open call for travel services.
The service descriptions and the evaluation process did not provide a sufficient guarantee for the best price-performance ratio.
The formula and the pricing mechanism were unsuitable as they did not allow for an appropriate evaluation of tenders submitted by the tenderers.
The framework agreement was concluded over a maximum duration of four years and a maximum amount of EUR 700 000.
In 2017, payments of 137,000 euros were made in Hhhe.
3.23.10.
The agencies should define a common definition of electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (180) (181). As a corresponding requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT overview covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the Commission, by the end of 2017, the Institute had introduced electronic invoicing for certain procedures, but not the electronic invitation to tender and the electronic submission of tenders.
3.23.11.
The Institute publishes job advertisements on its own website and in social media, but not on the website of the European Office for Personnel Selection (EPSO), which would provide transparency and publicity and enable the citizens to consult job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies.

C 434/138 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 2016 Completed DE ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Court observations At EUR 1.7 million or 51% (2015: EUR 2.2 million or 60%), the rate of committed appropriations for Title III (operational expenditure) carried over to the following financial year was still high, mainly due to year-on-year studies.
The Institute may adopt separate budget allocations to better meet the multi-annual nature of the activities, as well as inevitable distortions between contract signatures, deliveries and payments.
In 2016, the Institute launched an open call for a framework agreement on the maintenance and updating of its instruments and sources for gender statistics with a maximum amount of 1.6 million euros.
At the request of a bidder, the institution made it clear on its website that the maximum amount per lot was EUR 800 000.
However, two separate framework contracts with the same tenderer were concluded for a maximum amount of EUR 1.6 million per lot, with the option of extending the contracts by up to 50% per lot, allowing the institution to conclude individual contracts of up to EUR 4.8 million or three times the amount specified in the contract notice during the entire term of the framework contract (up to four years).
Payments in 2016 amounted to EUR 87 920.
In response to the survey, the Institute signed a contract for both framework contracts, which reduced the maximum number to EUR 800000 each (with a potential increase of up to 50 %).
In the invitation to tender under a negotiated procedure with a single tenderer for the procurement of services for the maintenance and support of IT tools and databases, the maximum price for all three services described was limited to EUR 81 000 (excluding VAT) and it was stipulated that more offers would not be taken into account.
However, after receiving offers for two of the three services requested, the Institute concluded a service contract with a price of 97 410 euros.

DE C 434/140 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE INSTITUTE 3.23.8.
The EIGE took note of the comment.
The EIGE has examined the weaknesses and will adjust the tendering procedures, regardless of the court's rulings in these cases, to minimise the risk of future litigation and potential dissatisfaction with rejected candidates.
3.23.9.
The EIGE takes note of the comment and stresses that internal controls are in place to audit and control the pricing of flight and hotel offers submitted by the contractor.
The EIGE will raise this issue with the network of EU agencies with the aim of exchanging examples of best practice.
In addition, the EIGE expressed interest in participating in a joint tender procedure organised by the Commission's (PMO) services.
Following the award of this contract, the EIGE intends not to renew its existing framework agreement on the provision of travel, accommodation and services.
The comprehensive installation of these modules at the EIGE is expected in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
In view of the limited number of procedures and the high costs associated with the services, the EIGE has decided not to pursue this option in accordance with the principles of economic efficiency and independence.
Taking into account the costs of providing job titles in all 24 EU official languages and the fact that some vacancies are recommended by the announcement of other vacancies, due to their specificity, the EIGE considers that the lists currently used for the publication of its vacancies provide adequate transparency and publicity.
3.23.12.
In line with the recommendations made in the report, the EIGE has drawn up an action plan which is regularly updated and updated.
The agreed deadline for the implementation of all measures expires on 31 December 2018, and the implementation is well advanced.

The London-based agency has prepared its preliminary financial statements and the ongoing interpretations on the basis of the information available at the time of signature (June 1, 2018).
3.24.8.
On 20 November 2017, the General Affairs Council of the European Union agreed to move the Agency's headquarters to Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The move to provisional amounts is planned for early 2019, and the agency has invested 18.6 million euros in its annual accounts for the costs involved.
3.24.9.
In addition, the rental contract provides for the Agency's current obligations in London for a rental period of up to 2039 without any exit clause.
The remaining rental costs of EUR 489 million are shown in the explanatory notes to the annual accounts. Of this amount, a maximum amount of EUR 465 million is shown as contingent liability for the remaining rental period after the Agency's planned move to Amsterdam.

COMMENTS ON THE LIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.24.11.
At the agency the head of the financial department is the head of the accounting officer.
3.24.12.
The Agency has also been fundamentally restructured twice since 2014 and has also been entrusted with new extensive tasks (see points 32.4.15-3.24.17). Although these events resulted in changes in the Agency's procedures and accounting system, the accounting system has not been revalidated since 2013. COMMENTS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUDGETARY AFFAIRS AND SERVICES 3.24.13.
The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which would increase transparency and publicity and enable the citizens of Europe to view job advertisements from the different EU agencies and institutions.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/143 32.4.14.
In accordance with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (187) (188). As a corresponding requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT aggregate covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
The Agency had introduced the electronic invitation to tender for certain procedures by the end of 2017, but not the electronic invoicing and submission of tenders.
Management of advisory services 3.24.15.
In the previous year, the Agency managed advisory services, including two selected projects to implement the Pharmacovigilance Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (189) and Regulation (EU) No 536/ 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (190) which required the development of complex EU-wide networks for the extensive technical IT developments.
Since the number of posts in the Agency's establishment plan was not increased, which would enable it to build up the necessary expertise internally, the Agency drew on consultancy firms to perform these tasks.
However, the use of consulting firms has led to the agency being dependent on this external expertise in a critical manner.
3.24.16.
In order to get the projects back under their control, the agency determined which functions should not be assigned externally, but should be perceived internally.
In addition, the agency goes on to award consultant contracts no longer according to the criteria of time and resources, but on a fixed price basis.
It also set up a more appropriate procedure for approving changes to the project.
3.24.17.
It will take time to reduce the critical nature of the agency of consultancy firms, and the impact of the actions taken will only become apparent over the years.
One of the two large-scale projects examined in 2016, the pharmacovigilance project (EudraVigilance database, about unexplored drug effects), was completed in 2017 with additional costs of around 0.5 million euros.
The clinical trials project is still under way. A start-up date has not been set, but the budget was increased by another 4.9 million euros in 2017 (191).

The Commission's Internal Audit Service conducted an action plan in 2017, implementing the directive on pharmacovigilance fees(192)(193). The Agency prepared an action plan to take corrective measures in areas where there is a potential need for improvement.

In 2014, the Agency conducted an administrative procedure against its IT staff.
Since the introduction of a new IT accounting system in 2011, reporting on the work-related obligations and on the implementation is not sufficiently transparent.
The agency concluded agreements with 25 hotels in London on business tariffs for the accommodation of experts without carrying out a competitive procurement procedure.
The six agreements on commercial tariffs and the payments of 2016 based on these agreements, amounting to around 2.1 million euros, are therefore contrary to the rules.
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the Agency) with a contractor in order to acquire software and licenses, as well as related IT maintenance and advisory services.
In 2016, a total of 8.9 million euros were paid to the contractor of the framework contract.
The Agency did not systematically compare the calculated prices and quotations with the offers of the suppliers and did not systematically check the invoices issued to the contractor of the framework contract.
C 434/146 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's observations Since 2014, the Agency has been fundamentally restructured twice, with high and medium-sized management positions being redeployed internally.
The reassignment of key IT and administrative staff was not successful, which exposed the agency and its activities to a significant risk of instabilities.
In addition, there is no system for analysing the available skills, for identifying gaps and for hiring and assigning suitable employees.
Year 2016 State of adoption of the correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.z.)Completed 2016 Consulting services In addition to the annual work carried out for all agencies, the Court analysed how the Agency used advisory services in two major projects.
The Parliament and the Council have entrusted the Agency with the implementation of the Regulation on pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012) and the Regulation on clinical trials (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014), which requires the development of complex EU-wide networks.
These tasks were transferred to the Agency at a time when it was expected to reduce its staff in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline of 2 December 2013.
The number of posts in the Agency's establishment plan has not been increased, which would enable it to acquire the necessary expertise in business and IT development.
Extensive use of external consultants Since the agency had only 13 employees in its IT-delivery department, it used the services of consulting companies in the areas of business analysis, information technology, project management and quality assurance.
In the second quarter of 2016, 131 local consultants and 60 other consultants were on hand for the agency.
The agency has therefore been dependent on external expertise since the start of the projects in critical measures, but does not have a strategy that regulates the use of consultants.
Insufficient control over project development and implementation When the agency was entrusted with the new tasks in 2012 and 2014, it did not have an adequate method for managing projects in this order of principles.
In 2014, a new method was introduced, which had to be substantially pr:ziziert in September 2016.
In progress (See paragraphs [3.24.15-3.24.17])
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/147 EN Court's observations In several cases, it deviated from the planned activities or the envisaged approach before this was approved on the basis of formal amendments.
By mid-2016, all external consultants had concluded contracts based on time and resources, although the project performance was clearly defined.
Distortions and cost increases In the development of the systems, the agency was confronted with delays and cost increases.
The numerous changes in project size, budget and time limits were mainly due to repeated adjustments to the system requirements which met the changing needs of the Member States(2).
The following table lists two large projects as examples.Originally planned time of commissioning Currently planned time of commissioning Original budget (Euro) budget on 31 October 2016 (Euro) EudraVigilance data bank on unexplored drug-related effects 3rd quarter 2015 4th quarter 2017 3.7 million 14.3 million clinical trials and EU database 1st quarter 2017 3rd quarter 2018 6.1 million 24.3 million The greening regulation requires the Commission to carry out an external evaluation of the Agency and its activities every ten years.

EN C 434/148 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.24.8.
3.24.11.
The Agency adheres to the financial regulations of the EMA: The accounting officer is already appointed by the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 50(1) of the EMA financial regulations, and the Board of Directors has also adopted a detailed charter of the tasks and responsibilities of the accounting officer.
The declaration of completeness signed by the auditor and by the Administrative Director reinforces this independence.
In March 2018, the validation of the Agency's accounting systems was started.
3.24.13.
The EMA offers the new section of transparency and publicity, as it publishes or has access to it, depending on the profile on the EMA website, LinkedIn, agency-wide job advertisements or in specialist publications.
As a result, the EMA attracts great interest among applicants across the EU, with more than 1 000 candidates participating in some competitions.
Moreover, in the general implementing rules concerning the recruitment and use of temporary staff, the selection decisions for temporary staff referred to in Article 2(f) of the SMO are published only in the working languages of the agencies; agencies which do not have a fixed working language, on the other hand, publish the selection decisions in all the official languages of the European Union.
The EMA's working language has been English since June 2015 due to a decision by the Administrative Director, which was approved by the Board of Directors.
However, the EPSO has informed the EMA that it will continue to require that the EMA translates the job advertisements into all official EU languages and makes these language versions available on the EMA website.
It should be noted that the call for tenders for posts in all official EU languages has a significant impact on the duration of the selection process and has a higher cost.
32.4.14.
By the end of 2017, the Agency had launched the electronic call for tenders for all procedures above the specified limit and for all procedures below the specified limit the e-mail call.
Although the Agency has not introduced electronic invoicing or submission of tenders, in September 2017, the Agency signed an agreement with the European Commission on access to and use of electronic submission of offers and is therefore waiting for the date to be appointed by the European Commission.
The Agency welcomes the Court's recognition that the EMA has implemented several important measures to respond to the Court's comments from the 2016 audit regarding the management of advisory services.
In the two projects, it is considered that, due to the complexity of the co-system of the interested parties and the desired system to be built up for clinical trials, further budgetary resources were required.
This amendment was submitted and approved under the portfolio regulation. The project status was verified in detail with the Board of Directors of the EMA.
3.24.18.
The Agency took note of the comment.

In accordance with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform solution for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (198) (199). As a corresponding requirement also applies for the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT aggregate covering all stages of public procurement procedures.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/151 EN ANNEX Follow-up to observations from previous years Statements by the Court In 2012, the Centre signed a framework contract with a maximum amount of EUR 250 000 to sign individual entries.
At the end of 2015, total payments under this contract amounted to EUR 382 181, i.e. the ceiling was exceeded by 50 %.
Two framework contracts with a maximum value of EUR 135 000 and EUR 650 000, respectively, dealt with the establishment of the Centre's evaluation committee, the decisions relating to decisions relating to closures and the signing of contracts as authorised authorising officers.
However, the delegation of powers granted by the authorising officer was limited to 130000 euros, and frame contracts were not expressly recognised in it.
In 2016, payments of 35 310 euros were made in the amount.
In its January 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed the need for the Observatory to improve the management of IT projects.
In particular, IAS concluded that a long-term strategic overall vision for the IT systems supporting the Centre's central operational departments was lacking, that the Centre's IT project management methodology was only partially adapted to its needs, and that the system requirements management procedure was inadequate.
The Observatory and IAS agreed on a plan for corrective measures.
EN C 434/152 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE OBSERVATION CELL 3.25.8. The Centre considers that the current organisational structure did not affect the independence of its accountants.
This independence was, on the contrary, consistently ensured in accordance with the relevant rules, in particular through the appointment of the auditors by the Management Board of the Observatory, the functional reporting and accountability of these auditors against the Management Board and the proper compliance with the rules on the separation of tasks of the various financial actors of the Observatory.
In this context, the Observatory is prepared to comply with the Court's recommendation, ensuring that the appropriate measures are in an appropriate way to the size of the organisation and that the effectiveness and efficiency of its functioning are maintained.
3.25.9.
The Centre also makes its job postings known on a standard basis through the dissemination of the members of its governing bodies, the national contact points involved in Reitox and the other EU agencies.
In addition, the Observatory's next selection process will also be published on the agency's cross-cutting portal for job vacancies; the network of EU agencies has developed this joint online platform to ensure that agencies' recruitment procedures are made public.
In this context, the Centre will present the cost-benefit ratio of an additional publication on the EPSO portal.
The Observatory meets the requirements relating to e-procurement procedures, in accordance with the EU's legal framework and the timetable established for the introduction of e-procurement procedures in the EU.
As early as August 2015, the Centre, in cooperation with the relevant services of the European Commission, set up the technical configuration/ICT tool, which is required for electronic invoicing (and provided by DG DIGIT to the European Commission for the implementation of DG DIGIT's framework contracts).
In addition, in 2017 the Observatory planned the preparatory measures necessary to implement the modules of the electronic call for tenders and the electronic submission of offers according to the provisions of the aforementioned legal framework from October 2018.
The implementation of this plan is under way and the Observatory assumes that it will meet this deadline without major problems.

COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.26.8. In 2017, the Agency had difficulties in reaching a sufficient number of tenderers in several medium-value procurement procedures.
3.26.9.
The Agency currently manages three dedicated, non-integrated IT systems (SIS II, VIS and Eurodac), all of which process data on the EU's freedom, security and justice policy area.
This approach could prevent the Agency from achieving economies of scale and synergies between the different systems.
The current considerations of extending the Agency's mandate over the coming years to the management of several additional IT systems underpin the increasing urgency of this problem.
The Agency should, in consultation with the Commission and the Member States, draw up a detailed cost-benefit analysis to contribute to a discussion on the future development strategy for the systems.
3.26.10.
The project for the construction of a new building at the site in Stra§burg significantly declined.
Although the Agency had already paid the full price for the construction work in 2016, these were still not completed by the end of 2017 and the progress reports on the work that was done covered only around 70% of the work.
Some of the agency's staff have already taken up the new building, although the work was still ongoing.
The agency and the contractor blame each other for the delays. In December 2017, the contractor made financial demands on the agency and filed a complaint.
The agency represents its own legal claim against the contractor (205).
3.26.11.
3.26.12.
In line with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a uniform framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (206) (207). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT overview covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
Advice 3.26.13.
The Agency uses consulting services mainly in connection with IT projects due to the nature of its activity.
According to the Agency's records, IT projects were implemented in 2017 within the financial and time frame.
For the few developmental maintenance projects that complain somewhat behind the schedule, exceptional reports were written.
(205) See also the Agency's 2017 annual accounts, Section 2.1.5 ăEvents after the closing date. (206) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013, Article 79 Electronic Administration (ăe-Government).
(207) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95(2) Electronic Administration (ăe-Government),
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/155 3.26.14.
The Agency uses an outsourcing model for the development and implementation of IT projects, whereby around 90% of the corresponding work is carried out by contractors.
There are three main framework agreements with three consortia, one for each system.
Payments to these framework agreements in 2017 amounted to EUR 3 million for Eurodac, EUR 16 million for SIS II and EUR 13 million for VIS.
Although all phases of IT projects, from the definition of requirements and milestones to the commissioning of new system components, are owned and controlled by the Agency, a model in which the development capabilities for so sensitive IT systems are outsourced to this extent carries considerable risks with regard to a superior dependence of the contractors.
This is all the more true in view of the limited number of potential contractors from operational and safety areas that can handle systems of this size and these requirements.
3.26.15.
At the same time, the low number of staff in operational key meetings, in particular in the ăReferat for Application Management and Maintenance (AMM), entails a significant risk for the continuity of the operation.
In the second half of 2017, the head of the AMM unit held the post of head of the operational department and the post of head of the ăReferat for operation and infrastructure, thus uniting the three highest management positions in the operational department, which entails further risks for the continuity.
3.26.16.
The framework agreements concluded with the respective consortia for the operation of the main IT systems include not only normal maintenance but also development maintenance work, the price of which cannot be calculated on the basis of the cost estimates attached to the framework agreements.
The prices for the individual contracts are calculated by the agency using a combination of fixed price and estimates of the time and resources spent, which is aimed at a solid cost control.
For the VIS contract, the agency also relied on the IFPUG(208) method, a standard method based on the function point analysis for determining the prices of developmental abilities.
The agency could also use the IFPUG method for other systems in development.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY FOOD 3.26.17.
The Agency made global commitments of EUR 69.9 million in total to cover future expenditure on new tasks and IT systems that were originally to be transferred to it in 2017, but for which the legal basis had not yet been adopted by the end of the year (Eurodac recast and allocation system to Dublin) or only recently (Regulation on the Entry/Exit System of 30 November 2017).
The corresponding appropriations for payments were reduced by two amending budgets amounting to EUR 85.6 million, from EUR 153.3 million in the original budget to EUR 85.6 million in the final budget.
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.26.18.
In December 2017, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) submitted to the Commission a report on the control of procurement procedures at eu-LISA (209).
The Agency drew up an action plan to address areas where there is a potential need for improvement.

The Agency concluded a framework agreement of EUR 2 million for procurement services, which is provided by a contractor for third party training, coaching and learning (training offers).
In 2016, the agency received and accepted goods worth 2.8 million euros, for which there were no commitments and legal obligations.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/157 EN Court observations The Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded in its July 2016 audit report that the overall structure and practical implementation of the procedures ensure that eu-LISA operates the SIS II, VIS and Eurodac IT systems in a way that enables national authorities using these systems to exchange data continuously and without interruption.
The rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year is high for Title II (administrative expenditure) with EUR 5 million and 63% of committed appropriations (2015: EUR 9 million and 50% respectively).
In June 2015, the agency completed a construction contract of EUR 21.5 million for its premises in Stra§burg.
At one of the meetings of the Agency's Management Board in 2016, the Commission representative raised the issue of rising maintenance costs.
Although the rising costs can be explained, for example, by the continuous development and extended functions of the systems, the Court determined procurement procedures, in which the agency did not check that the most cost-effective solution had been chosen.
For example, under a framework agreement, the Agency acquired a new software license for 4.6 million euros without verifying whether the contractor of the framework agreement, acting as intermediary between the Agency and potential software suppliers, had achieved the best price.
In May 2016, the Agency concluded a EUR 194 million framework agreement with a consortium covering the development and maintenance of the Visa Information System (VIS) and the Biometric Matching System (BMS) over a period of up to six years.

C 434/158 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court observations An external evaluation of the Agency was carried out on behalf of the Commission by March to December 2015; the results were presented in March 2016 in the final evaluation report.
The evaluators made 64 recommendations to further improve operational management, seven of which are considered critical and eleven very important.
The Agency has drawn up a plan to comply with the recommendations; this plan is currently being implemented. Year 2016 State of adoption (completed/in progress/outstanding/n.e.) n.e.c.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/159 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.26.8.
In the case of medium-value procurement procedures, the Agency shall systematically publish ex-ante notifications on its website in accordance with Article 103(2) of the Financial Regulation.
In December 2017, the Commission presented two proposals for a regulation establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems (borders and visas, police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration).
In addition, in the context of the revision of the mandate of the Agency (in the last stages still to be adopted), the responsibility for the development of interoperability measures is determined, which are subject to the adoption of relevant legislative proposals.
The Agency has so far contributed its technical expertise and know-how to the discussions of the High Level Group on Information Systems and Interoperability.
At the same time, a study (which is not yet completed) was carried out to obtain a clear picture of the future architecture of interoperable IT systems.
The study also includes an impact assessment as well as a migration and integration plan for the interoperability components of existing and future systems.
The agency supports the delay in the implementation of the construction project in Stra§burg.
The staff moved to the new building after a previous decrease in the work.
The construction work in the other building concerns the data centre and is still ongoing.
The agency signed a contract with an external law firm to provide legal support for this construction contract.
She pointed out that she also published job offers on the website of the EU Agency Network and on the website ăEU Training.
However, additional funding is needed to take account of EPSO's language rules, according to which job advertisements are to be translated into all EU languages (e.g. the cost of translating a job advertisement into all EU languages is estimated at EUR 12 000).
As regards the electronic submission of tenders, due to technical problems, the tool could not be used on the platform managed by DG DIGIT of the Commission, and, like other agencies, the Agency was therefore unable to use the platform in a reliable manner in 2017.
Once the platform is stable, the agency intends to use it for its assignments.
3.26.13.
The Agency notes the findings and is seeking to further reduce the number of projects that fall behind the timetable and has therefore started implementing measures to improve the planning process (see also note 32.6.16).
According to the Agency's key performance indicators (point 22) in the 2017 consolidated annual report, the projects completed against the parameters of quality, cost and time result in an actual value of 8.79%, which is within the target of 10%.
Furthermore, in 2017, eu-LISA's project management method was adapted and updated to align it with the PRINCE2 strategy and method.
An Enterprise Project Management Tool has been introduced to enable better reporting and resource allocation throughout the agency.
3.26.14.
The agency besties the high participation of external contractors in IT projects (operational and organisational).
This high outsourcing rate is directly linked to the Commission's Communication COM(2013) 519 on financial and human resources planning for decentralised agencies in the period 2014-2020.
The establishment plan did not provide sufficient posts for the scope of the tasks assigned to it in 2012 when the Agency was established.
Moreover, the scope of the Agency's tasks was considerably increased from 2013 onwards, but its requests for additional staff were rejected and, as requested in the Commission's communication, the Agency had to reduce staff (a total of seven posts).
In order to ensure a proper separation of tasks, the contractors involved in the quality assurance do not provide external support for the operational management of IT-Group systems.
The agency bested this extraordinary situation, in which a staff member had to carry out temporary additional tasks.
The appointment was forced due to the long absence of the head of the operational department and the ongoing recruitment procedure for the further free leadership position.
To remedy the situation, the Agency appointed another employee, the Head of the ăSecurity Unit, as the Chief Head of the ăOperation and Infrastructure Unit, until the newly appointed leader took up his duties on 1 July 2018.
EN C 434/160 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.26.16.
System developments can only be described in summary when the call for tenders for framework contracts is launched, which is why specific developments must be negotiated as soon as the requirements are known (e.g. when the legal basis of the systems changes).
As part of the reworking of its procurement strategy, the Agency will address the procurement options, including the adoption of the IFPUG method to reduce the dependency of a single contractor on further developments.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) action plan in 2017 concerning the control of procurement procedures includes elements that are relevant to this remark.
3.26.17.
The scenario and the associated risks were identified in 2016 and included in the estimate of the Agency's revenue and expenditure for 2017.
Due to delays in the adoption of the legal basis of the new tasks, the Board of Directors was informed throughout the year about the risks and constraints associated with the adoption of major global commitments.
3.26.18.
The agency approves this information.

EN C 434/168 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWER OF THE AGENCY 3.28.8.
Europol employs over 220 liaison officers from EU Member States and third countries and organisations.
The common working language of Europol is English. Therefore, Europol's internal language arrangements adopted by the Management Board lay down that, unless otherwise agreed, recruitment procedures should be carried out in English.
For this reason, Europol's job advertisements are published in English.
Europol manages an effective and transparent recruitment process with a quota of vacancies of 0% at the end of 2017. In the 89 recruitment procedures carried out in 2017, there were an average of 58 applicants per selection procedure.
For the publication on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), the translation into the EU official languages is required in addition to the English version.
Due to the high number of job vacancies per year, translation into the EU official languages would entail high costs and the duration of the procedures would be longer.
Europol focuses on operational needs in budgetary expenditure, which is why job advertisements are translated into all EU official languages, including EPSO publication, only in certain cases (e.g. the Executive Director or Deputy Executive Directors).

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF ACCOUNTS 3.29.8.
The Agency's head of the Corporate Services department is the head of the invoicing officer.
In 2017, the Agency encountered difficulties in obtaining studies because of unrealistic market restrictions.
At least three open tenders were unsuccessful, as the Agency only received tenders in the required quality which significantly exceeded the specified maximum contract value.
3.29.10.
In line with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a single framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (224) (225). As a corresponding requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT summary covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).

At 5.2 million euros and 68% (2015: 5.7 million euros and 70% respectively) the rate of committed appropriations for Title III (operational expenditure) for the following financial year was high.
This is primarily due to the nature of the activities to which the financing of studies is based, which extend over several months, often also from the turn of the year.
The Agency may use separate budgets to better accommodate the multi-annual nature of the activities and the inevitable delays between contract signatures, deliveries and payments.

Following the reorganisation of the Agency, which will be completed by the end of 2018, the position of the accountant will be subordinated to the administrative responsibility of the Director and will be directly under the Management Board (as has always been the case).
In order to maintain existing synergies, the invoicing officer will continue to work closely with the Corporate Services department.
3.29.9.
All the studies concerned were publicly tendered and were therefore accessible to all economic operators.
The extensive studies carried out by FRA are quite unique in the EU, both in terms of the subject matter and in terms of having to be carried out in all EU Member States.
In addition, the Agency has limited resources for these measures.
However, in future calls for proposals of this kind, the Agency will consider carrying out market research, if necessary the technical requirements and, if possible, reassessing the priorities of the studies to be carried out.
However, this problem will be much easier to solve if more funds are used for operational expenditure.
The Agency has started to implement such systems in 2018, which will be available within the set deadline.

EUROPEAN AGENCY FOR THE FRONTEX INTRODUCTION 3.30.1.
The European Agency for Border and Coast Guard (hereinafter referred to as the Agency), was established by Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council (228) (the new Sanctions Regulation), repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 (229).
It has been expanded on the basis of the European Agency for the Development of Operational Cooperation at the external borders of the Member States, maintaining the abbreviation "Frontex" and the Warsaw headquarters.
The new regulation extends the Agency's mandate, and gives the Agency the task of ensuring an integrated border management at the external borders at the European level in order to effectively manage the crossing of external borders.
This implies the fight against migratory pressure and potential future threats at these borders, while at the same time contributing to the fight against serious criminality with a cross-border dimension, in order to ensure a high level of internal security within the Union, while fully respecting fundamental rights and respect for freedom in this area.

According to our assessment, the revenue underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 is legal and regular in all essential respects.
Payments Jurisdiction of the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.30.6.
Note 3.30.7.
The Agency's expenditure on financial assistance has increased significantly from EUR 123 million (2016) to EUR 167 million (2017).
Unlike in previous years, the Agency did not carry out ex-post checks on the reimbursement of expenditure related to financial assistance in 2017.
It considers that the ex ante checks carried out prior to reimbursement have been improved and that now as soon as they reach a certain destination they offer the necessary security.
Since 2014, however, the Court has repeatedly reported that the cooperating States often do not show enough evidence of the expenditure they have claimed, which was further confirmed in this case (see points 3.30.12-3.30.13).
3.30.8.
In 2016, the Court recommended that the Agency identify the most appropriate financing mechanism in an in-depth analysis (233).
In this context, the Court notes that at the end of 2017, the Board of Directors decided to use unit costs instead of reimbursement of actual operational costs.
At the same time, a pilot project was launched in 2018 to determine the unit costs for operational resources deployed by cooperating states.
In addition, in June 2017, the Board approved a new organisational structure of the Agency, which will take effect from 2018 and includes the creation of a new inspection and control body, which will report directly to the Executive Director and the Board in order to adapt the existing organisation to the new mandate (see point 3.30.9).
3.30.9.
In view of the migration crisis facing the Union, the mandate of the Agency was substantially expanded in 2016.
The Agency's budget was increased by 75% in 2016 and the budget for 2017 was again 21% higher than in the previous year.
Personnel increased by 18% in 2016 and by an additional 43% compared with the previous year.
The adaptation of the systems and procedures to the new mandate and the new circumstances is still in progress.
The following remarks do not call into question the Court's judgment and are to be read against the background of the challenges that the Agency had to address.
COMMENTS ON LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ORDER ACTIVITY OF THE PROJECTS 3.30.10.
Following an open call, the Agency received four offers of guidance services for the promotion of migrants within Greece.
Following the selection criteria, three offers were retained and one was excluded.
The only criterion for the award was the price.
In April 2017, the Agency signed a framework agreement of EUR 2 million for a period of three years with the company that had offered the lowest price.
However, the contractor's funding was limited on a seasonal basis and he had problems fulfilling the contract, so that the agency left the contract at the end of 2017.
In order to ensure continuity of services, the Agency for the remaining period signed a new framework agreement of EUR 1.8 million with the second highest bidder in November 2017, who had offered the second lowest price.
It did not negotiate the terms of this replacement contract with the bidders ranked second and third, but signed the new contract on the basis of the original bid submitted by the second-placed bidder.
The direct award of the replacement contract was contrary to the rules, as the original award procedure was completed and a negotiated procedure to agree the terms of the contract, which were to apply until the conclusion of a new open procedure, did not take place.
No payments were made for this replacement order in 2017.
3.30.11.
The Staff Regulations provide that in the case of an external selection procedure, temporary staff shall be recruited only in grades SC 1 to SC 2, AST 1 to AST 4 or AD 5 to AD 8 (234).
In 2017, the Agency hired two staff members (2016: 14) in higher AST grades.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/175 COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.30.12.
In 2017, the Agency of the Islindian Guard provided financial support in connection with the deployment of an aircraft in Greece.
Before reimbursement of expenditure claimed by Iceland, the Agency requested invoices as proof for a category of expenditure declared.
Although the invoices were never submitted, the Agency reimbursed around EUR 440 000.
In this case, the ex ante control was thus ineffective.
3.30.13.
The Agency also co-financed the use of an aircraft used by the Spanish Guardia Civil.
In the absence of supporting documents for the costs claimed for inspection and maintenance work, the Agency reimbursed EUR 430 000 on the basis of average costs per flight hour.
This average cost was calculated on the basis of cost ceilings used in trade between the Spanish authorities and private contractors for inspection and maintenance work.
There is a risk that higher costs have been reimbursed than actually incurred.
3.30.14.
Although the Agency has already started its current operations in 2014, it has still not drawn up a comprehensive contingency plan approved by the Management Board.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.30.15.
The Agency again cancelled a large amount of committed appropriations carried over from the previous year for the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by states participating in joint actions, amounting to EUR 7.7 million or 16.5% (2016: EUR 5.6 million or 17.6%).
This shows that the cooperating States had again considerably overestimated the expenses to be reimbursed by the Agency.
Although funds transferred for joint actions had to be cancelled in two consecutive years, in 2017 the Agency transferred an amount of 9.6 million euros from other budget lines to joint operations, which again transferred an amount of 40.5 million euros to the following financial year.
Joint actions represent 69% of the total amount cancelled in 2017 (EUR 11.1 million) and 46% of the total amount transferred in 2018 (EUR 87.6 million).
3.30.16.
In 2017, 66.5 million euros were spent on repatriation. However, fewer actions were carried out than funds were available.
The Agency therefore paid back to the Commission EUR 13.5 million or 20.3% (2016: EUR 23 million or 37.5%).
In addition, the Agency paid EUR 4 million of the budget estimate under Title I of the budget (staff expenditure) to the end of 2017, as not as many new employees could be hired as planned.
3.30.17.
The Agency's original budget for 2017 amounted to 8.8 million euros for the required operational financial reserve for the financing of immediate border security operations and return operations (235).
However, in September and then again in October 2017, the Agency transferred 1.9 million euros (totaling 3.8 million euros) from the reserve to its operational budget to finance other activities.
3.30.18.
After the transfer of appropriations from other budget lines and the establishment of an amending budget, the appropriations allocated to the reserve amounted to 24.7 million euros and 8.1% of the original budget.
However, the Agency used the reserve mainly to finance standard operations (8.4 million euros) and to finance a project for remote air surveillance (drones, 7 million euros), for which it had estimated only 1.1 million euros.
The estimates and use of unmandable complaints are incompatible with the speciality budget principle and undermines the transparency of the budget.
COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMICITY OF BUDGETARY CURRENCY AND SERVICES 3.30.19. The Agency publishes job advertisements on its own website and in other media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
3.30.20.
In accordance with its framework financial regulation, the agencies should establish a single format for electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (236) (237). As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an overall IT format covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the Commission, by the end of 2017, the Agency had initiated electronic invoicing and the electronic invitation to tender for certain procedures, but not the electronic submission of tenders.

However, the documents provided by the cooperating States as supporting documents for the expenditure claimed are not always sufficient.
In addition, no certificates were required, although this is recommended for grants exceeding certain ceilings in the implementing provisions for the EU Financial Regulation (1).
In view of the large and constantly increasing number of grant agreements and the size of the allocated expenditures, which must be reimbursed by the agency, the question arises whether more efficient and cost-effective forms of financing could be used.
The contributions of the associated Schengen countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway) must be calculated more precisely in order to better comply with the legislation(3).
The ex post operation carried out by the Agency in Iceland in October 2015 resulted in a total amount of EUR 1.4 million of irregular payments related to the depreciation of a vessel involved in seven joint actions during the period 2011-2015.
The Icelandic guards had requested reimbursement of the depreciation costs for the ship, although its service life had already exceeded the Agency's guidelines.
Although the Agency is entitled to recover the irregular payments made within the last five years, it has announced that only payments made since January 2015 will be recovered at a rate of 0.6 million euros.
C 434/178 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court observations The Internal Security Fund was established for the period 2014-2020.
It comprises two instruments: the instrument for financial support for external borders and visas, and the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, through which EUR 2.8 billion (foreign borders and visas) and EUR 1 billion (police cooperation) are provided to finance projects.
Under the instrument for financial support for external borders and visas, the Commission shall reimburse Member States for the cost of equipment such as vehicles or ships, as well as operating costs such as fuel or maintenance costs.
The Agency shall also reimburse participants in joint actions for such costs.
There is therefore a risk of double financing (4) which is not taken into account.
The costs incurred at border crossings of participating states are determined on the basis of cost allocations, which include ăFix costs (depreciation and maintenance costs), ăvariable expenditures (mainly fuel) and ăUse costs (mainly expenses and other expenses for crew members).
The reported costs are based on actual values and conform to national standards. Consequently, the approaches of the participating states differ, which leads to a system that is particularly complex for all stakeholders.
In its Special Report No 12/2016, the Court recommended that agencies use simplified cost options whenever deemed appropriate to avoid such inefficiencies (5).
The Agency's previous advisory regulation, which was in force until 5 October 2016, provided for the funding of joint implementation actions carried out with participating countries.
However, from January to October 2016, the Agency financed national return operations with an amount of EUR 3.6 million.
These payments are illegal.
The Staff Regulations provide that, in the case of an external selection procedure, temporary staff shall be recruited only in grades SC 1 to SC 2, AST 1 to AST 4 or AD 5 to AD 8 (6).
In 2016, the Agency hired 14 staff in higher AST grades.
At EUR 6.4 million and 43% (2015: EUR 3.2 million and 38%) for Title II (administrative expenditure) and at EUR 67.3 million and 37% (2015: EUR 40.2 million and 35% respectively) for Title III (operational expenditure), there was an increase in the rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year.
The Agency may decide to introduce separate budgets in order to better accommodate delays that inevitably arise between legal obligations, order execution and activity, as well as the corresponding payments.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/179 EN Court's observations The cancellation rate of the committed appropriations carried over from 2015 was high for Title III (operational expenditure) of 6.4 million euros and 16% respectively, since the costs of 2015 that still had to be reimbursed to the participating States in 2016 had been overestimated.
The Agency's expanded mandate places great emphasis on reverse actions; the Agency's budget for 2016 allocated EUR 63 million to reverse actions.
However, EUR 23 million and 37.5% of this amount were paid back to the EU budget, as fewer reverse actions were carried out than planned.
The significant reduction in the procurement procedure for a framework contract of EUR 50 million for the chartering of aircraft and related services for Frontex return operations contributed to this situation and continues to have a negative impact on the number of return actions organised by the Agency.
The launch of this award procedure was scheduled for March 2016 and still does not take place by the end of the year.
On 22 December 2015, the Commission and the Agency, acting as co-legislator and coordinator of three other co-legislators (EASO, IOM and UNHCR) (7), signed a grant agreement of EUR 5.5 million for regional support for protection-oriented migration management in the Western Balkans and Turkey, which will apply from 1 January 2016 for a period of three years.
However, the cooperation agreements with the three partners (legal obligations) of EUR 3.4 million were signed only between August and November 2016.
In the case of two of these agreements, the commitments with which the funds must be released before legal commitments were made were not made until October and December 2016.
In addition, commitments amounted to EUR 1.2 million and covered only pre-financing payments.
Such action is contrary to the provisions of the Financial Regulation on budgetary management; moreover, the late signing of agreements led to uncertainty regarding operational cooperation between the partners.
The Agency's 2016 establishment plan provided for 275 posts for temporary officials and staff (8). At the end of 2016, only 197 and 71% of those posts were filled, mainly as 50 new posts were created only in October 2016 and the recruitment has yet to be completed.
The agency regularly points to difficulties in recruiting employees with the required profiles, which is partly due to the correction coefficients for the employees at the back (66.7 %). Year 2016 Status of the correction acceptance (completed/in progress/outstanding/ n.e.c.)

This increase was not based on a sound assessment of needs.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/181 REPLY OF THE AGENCY OBSERVATIONS ON LEGAL ACTIVITY AND ORDER AGENCY 3.30.10.
After Frontex had decided to terminate the contract, it was necessary to ensure the continuity of the services until a new contractor was selected.
In view of the limited market for the services in question in the region (the very small number of economic operators) it was considered that the most appropriate solution to the conclusion of a cross-border agreement with the company which had cut off as the second-best supplier in the original tender for the selection of shipowners.
In this case, therefore, it is not a continuation of a tendering procedure which has already been concluded.
The agency took into account in its decision that the company already had experience in providing services for Frontex, and that the relevant feedbacks were very positive; the offered guide met all the minimum technical requirements.
The contractor agreed to provide the services on the same terms and conditions as were required and offered in the original tender.
In November 2017, an exemption was signed in which the hindsights for this decision were explained.
The agreement was signed by both parties in December 2017 and entered into force in January 2018.
The application of the price as the sole criterion had been carefully examined and was based on the experience gained by Frontex in the past two years in awarding contracts for the provision of funds for takeovers between the Greek islands and Turkey.
Due to the market restrictions in the geographical region, the very small number of operators with a limited offer of F-F-F-E was not intended to establish qualitative award criteria.
The services provided by Frontex were short journeys between Greek islands and Turkey to promote returnees in the framework of the EU-Turkey Agreement on Transfers, ensuring that these actions were carried out in a safe environment and in full respect of fundamental rights.
In line with the last sentence of Article 31(2) of the Staff Regulations (In order to take account of the special needs of the institutions, the recruitment of officials can also take account of the labour market situation in the Union.)
This decision was fully in line with the posts (which form part of the budget) and had never been questioned by the budgetary authorities.
Since March 2017, Frontex has not hired any external applicants in higher grades than grade AST 4.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.30.12.
The costs for inspection/maintenance work are defined as the costs for all inspection/maintenance work during the entire service life of the device (...).
The data reported by the manufacturer or maintenance body of the manufacturer using the device is based on the data.
This means that the hourly rate can be expressed in the form of a cost statement of the respondent, either based on the manufacturer's estimates or on a price calculated on the basis of the actual costs incurred in previous years, or on a cost statement, using reference data for similar means of use if it is a new means of use and no data are available.
Invoices (or due to the data amount of equivalent booking documents) can only be made available if the hourly price is based on the actual costs incurred during the reference year.
However, the recipient also has the ability to set an hourly rate on the basis of average reference prices if no invoices were actually issued.
This was the case with the selected payment, whereby the Icelandic K"stenwache Frontex provided an estimate of the cost of maintenance.
The documents submitted by the Icelandic Knesset Guard included the results of ex-post controls carried out by an ex-post control team of Frontex in 2015 during a visit to the maintenance centre in Iceland, where the team had submitted the documents provided by the Icelandic Knesset Guard as the basis for their calculation methods.
Therefore, the document submitted by Iceland considers that Frontex has sufficient reason to approve the issue.
The total amount of an hourly rate for all inspection/maintenance work of an aircraft with fixed wings is the result of three routes with special regulations: 有 Engine maintenance 有 The signed contract provided for a maximum amount of EUR 9 010 475.50, but the payments are based on the hourly rate for the maintenance of an engine.
The Guardia Civil calculates Frontex the hourly rate for engine maintenance according to the contractual specifications.
If less time is spent on the maintenance of the engines, the overall ceiling is not reached.
Therefore, in this case, the hourly rate is not relevant to the total value of the contract.
EN C 434/182 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 的 General maintenance work 你 Geme§ The provisions of the relevant contract are a contract for a total price (not a framework contract), with monthly invoices for the individual work of the contractor provided.
The Agency assumes that the Guardia Civil will pay the total amount indicated in the contract upon termination of the contract.
The amount of an hourly price is calculated by dividing this total cost by the number of flight hours.
不 Delivery of spare parts 的 Gem的§ The terms of the contract are, as above, a contract for a total price (not a framework contract), with monthly invoices for the concrete work carried out by the contractor.
The Agency assumes that the Guardia Civil will pay the total amount indicated in the contract upon termination of the contract.
From the above-mentioned grounds, the Agency cannot agree to the Court's risk assessment, since the reimbursements of the Guardia Civil were based on a contract on a total price which was estimated to correspond in the end to the contributions paid on the basis of concrete invoices.
The current concept of operational performance measures, the current strategy and the resulting emergency plans were developed and (annually) updated on the basis of the legal framework and structure in force until the end of 2016.
Due to the extended mandate and the corresponding new structure, the emergency sections of the respective places will be revised in particular, since the organizational changes also require a complete reworking of the underlying documents.
COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.30.15.
The main challenge is related to the ability of commitments during a given year.
To avoid the risk of high cancellations, Frontex also asked the people to submit their requests for a final payment for the first six months of 2016 and to forward Frontex's precise estimates of the costs for ongoing operations (December 2016) or planned operations (January 2017) as part of its operational activities in 2016.
The main objective of these calls was to identify possible overburdens, to reduce the corresponding SFD allocations and to re-use the funds in 2016.
Despite some positive results of this action, the transfer of funds was still high.
Consequently, despite a proper assessment of the actual financial needs, Frontex required additional funds to ensure the financial coverage of operations in the autumn of 2016, since the cancelled funds of the terminated and ongoing operations were not available at that time.
The Agency has developed a simplified support scheme, which will be implemented from the 2018 operational cycle and in which increases of up to one year will apply significantly higher costs; the Agency not only strengthens the monitoring of the implementation of grants, but also seeks to reduce the cancellation of transfers.
Implementation Despite the repayment of funds to the Commission, the main objective of the Agency in relation to recovery operations has been achieved: it provided Member States with technical and operational support for recovery operations and carried out specific actions aimed at the period prior to recovery (to identify returnees, training/training, exchange of knowledge between Member States, etc.).
In 2017, the number of return actions coordinated by Frontex increased significantly: with an increase of 47% compared to the previous year, the number of migrants increased from 10,700 in 2016 to 14,200 in 2017.
This represents an annual 10% share of the total number of migrants actually returning from the EU to third countries (in 2014 the corresponding figure was 2%).
Recruitment Repayments of staff expenditure appropriations were mainly due to difficulties and the associated delays in recruitment procedures: lengthy procedures, long deadlines, insufficient number of applicants and a lack of geographical balance due to a low correction coefficient.
However, the Agency considers it to be a success that over 250 new employees were recruited and trained within one year.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/183 3.30.17.
In 2017, the Agency was the first year of implementation of the new ECC Regulation.
Under Article 75(13), the Agency is obliged to include in its budget 4 % of the funds earmarked for operational measures in order to finance emergency operations for border management purposes (RABIT) and return operations.
On 1 October of each year, at least a quarter of the reduction should remain available to meet a demand that will occur by the end of the year.
The required operational revision was introduced so that during the year, the agency could at any time provide a certain reserve for the execution of immediate items for border protection purposes and for the coverage of the possible costs of such an emergency operation.
The European Parliament had amended the original text of the ECC Regulation proposed by the Commission to add that by 1 October only a quarter of the gap for the remaining three months of the year must remain available.
The ECC regulation is silent on what is to be done with the remaining three-quarters of the deficit after 1 October; this point is unclear.
The first transfer at the end of September was intended for the financing of reinforced operational measures in the air and at sea and the acquisition of own air monitoring services; the second transfer took place after 1 October.
The Board of Directors was informed in the monthly report on transfers.
The Agency considers that the legislator should provide clarity.
The non-obligatory situation had already been envisaged during the preparations for the Single Programming Document (SPD) 2017-2019.
In accordance with Article 75(3ff) of the ECC Regulation, the preparation of the SPD and the allocation of revenue and expenditure in the year N-2 was started and completed in late autumn of the year N-1.
The ECC Regulation entered into force in October 2016.
The Agency had to plan the detailed annual work programme 2017 (as part of the SPD 2017-2019) for the whole year 2016 without the final outcome of the discussions on the ECC Regulation and thus without a clearly defined legal basis.
Towards the end of 2016, the SPD 2017-2019 was already completed and was available for approval to the Board of Directors, which fully supported the creation of the non-restrictive situation in view of the transition to the European Border and Coast Guard.
The Commission stated in its opinion on the SPD 2017-2019, (C92016)8722, in paragraph 63: ăThe Commission acknowledges that emergency planning has become a guiding principle for the preparation of the annual work programme and that the Agency intends to provide almost 10 % of its operational budget for the so-called ‘operational flexibilit'tÔ (...).
In this context, the Commission calls on the Agency to establish two separate actions within its budget, the first fully in line with Article 75, paragraph 13, of the ECC Regulation, and the second providing the Agency with the possibility of maintaining operational flexibility in order to deal with emergency situations which are not immediate.
Since the Agency publishes its job offers in English, while the EPSO requires translations into all EU official languages, this would mean that the cost would increase considerably and that the recruitment procedure could not be used.
Frontex distributes information on vacancies about other channels, i.e. the network of EU agencies, the board of directors, permanent representations, Eurobrussels and social media.
Following the signing of an agreement with the Commission (DG DIGIT), the instrument will be used for the first time.
As a formal deadline for this instrument, Article 90(2) of the Procurement Directive, which the Commission will apply to the agencies, was established at the end of October 2018; Frontex will comply with this deadline.

C 434/186 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Statements by the Court An external evaluation of the Foundation was carried out on behalf of the Commission in 2016.
This was the first step in a cross-sectional evaluation of the four agencies involved in employment, social affairs and integration(1).
The evaluators concluded that the significant restructuring of the Foundation had no significant negative effects since 2011 and that the internal and external stakeholders were mainly positive, in particular with regard to strategy and effectiveness.
The management structure of the Foundation was considered efficient and effective.
The evaluation also stresses that the Foundation has further improved its monitoring capacity since 2011, but that it needs to make its activities and achievements even clearer.
Uniformisation and simplification of indicators within a single intervention logic and the use of common terminology throughout the Foundation would help to improve them.
The Foundation developed a plan to implement the recommendations of the evaluators.
In his report on the Foundation's financial statements for 2011, the Court emphasised that the situation regarding the Foundation's shortcomings is unsatisfactory and that there is a risk that the Foundation will not be able to continue its activities continuously.
The situation has remained unchanged since the consortium responsible for managing the building complex, which used part of the rubble in the complex itself, was completed in 2011 and left the corresponding rubble empty§.
The Member State in which the Foundation is established must urgently find a solution to this problem.

COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.33.8.
In 2017, procedures for awarding and awarding grants were not adequately documented.
As regards the procurement of services by means of low and medium-value contracts, there were inconsistencies in the published contract documents, records to explain the pre-selection of candidates for low-value contracts were missing, and for the award procedures for hiring temporary jobs, the Office did not draw up evaluation reports.
In addition, the award criteria were not clearly stated.
As regards grants, risk assessments were not appropriate and expert opinions were not signed.
The Office should establish a common definition of electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures, in accordance with its financial regulations (253).
The Office had not introduced any of these tools by the end of 2017.
CONTINUING COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS 3.33.10. The annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
(253) Article 74 Electronic administration (ăe-Government).
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/193 ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Statements by the Court The Office uses the largest part of its payments to make electronic payments.
The accountant or his two alternates can sign the payments electronically.
As of 31 December 2015, the amounts outstanding were 240 766 Eu-ro(1) (mainly annual fees) than 90 days.
The Office did not use all the possibilities provided for in its financial regulation to recover outstanding fees, such as foreclosure (2). At EUR 788 540 or 40 % (2015: EUR 395 882 or 28 %), the rate of committed appropriations for Title II (administrative expenditure) carried over to the following financial year was high.
These transfers mainly concern current expenditures (284,423 euros), IT projects (253,483 euros) and costs for examinations and evaluations (137,098 euros), for which services are partly provided in 2017 or charged only this year.
The cancellation rate of the 2015 payment appropriations transferred to the following year was also high in Title II with 17% (2015: 20%), indicating that budgeting needs to be improved.
Periodic external performance evaluations are not required in the Office's "Grundungsverordnung".
Although the Office or the Commission has carried out ad hoc evaluations of specific issues, the Office, together with the Commission, should undertake, at least every five years, to commission external performance evaluations, as most other agencies do.
EN C 434/194 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE OFFICE 3.33.8.
It agrees with the Court that the documentation should be improved and points out that the necessary evaluations, evaluations and opinions have been carried out as part of the respective procedures.
3.33.9.
The Office has concluded a contractual agreement with the European Commission before the end of the year on the provision of the tool for the electronic submission of offers.
At that time, there were no tenders that fulfilled the conditions for the use of the tool, and the use of the tool was not mandatory at that time.

We have a) the Office's annual accounts consisting of the annual accounts(256) and the budget implementation reports (257) for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and b) the legality and regularity of the accounts underlying them pursuant to Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
3.34.4. According to our assessment, the Office's annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017 represent the Office's annual and financial position as at 31 December 2017, the results of its annual accounts and cash flows as well as the changes in the net revenue for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 in accordance with its financial regulations and the accounting regulations adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, which are based on internationally recognised accounting grounds for the public sector, in all essential respects.

Payments Jurisdiction of the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.34.6.
3.34.7.
In 2017, the Office cancelled EUR 3.2 million, or 15.9% of the committed appropriations carried over from the financial year 2016.
The Office continued to use fixed prices for services (258).
The prices used in the various services are based on unit prices (price/person's day, etc.) as defined in framework agreements and the number of units used for the service in question.
The Office will ensure that unit prices are correctly applied when it comes to price quotations from contractors.
3.34.10.
However, the list of services to be provided in connection with the framework agreement was not exhaustive in the case of a framework agreement with a value of EUR 80 million on general advisory, audit and project management services as well as studies.
In order to assess the offers, the service descriptions contained two business cases relating to the management of a project and a multi-project programme.
This framework agreement is a multi-framed mixed agreement, partly using a cascade process (general advisory and project management services) and partly a renewed call for competition (preparation and studies).
The protected units were predetermined by the Office but the bidders were asked to determine the distribution between the different profiles.
The framework agreement and also some of the associated individual agreements were therefore advertised on the basis of unit prices, types of profiles and quality, but not the expected number of benetigte units, which is another essential element in the calculation of a fixed price contract.
3.34.11.
Under this framework agreement, a single contract with a fixed price of EUR 145 447.50 was awarded, which mainly concerns the provision of support services for the execution of a document management project.
The necessary staff days for the provision of these services cannot be derived either from the business cases described in the service descriptions or from the description contained in the individual contract.
In the case of a fixed price as set out in this individual order, there is therefore a risk that the services will not be provided in the most economic way.
3.34.12.
If not all the conditions for the provision of services in the award of the framework agreement can be laid down, the individual undertakings will be more appropriate to reopen competition among several contractors in the framework agreement.
CONTINUING OBSERVATIONS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARs 3.34.13. The annex provides an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
(258) See also paragraph 21 of the previous year's report.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/197 EN Year 2016 State of correction (completed/in progress/outstanding/n.e.) Completed (3) ANNEX Follow-up to observations from previous years Court observations The Office's budget implementation rate was low at 89%, suggesting an inaccurate estimate of its expenditure in the 2016 budget.
As a result of the most recent changes to the Guarantee Regulation and the Office's financial regulations, it has become more important that the Office should, if necessary, draw up a detailed budget with the help of an amending budget, since mechanisms linked with the budget estimates such as the allocation of appropriations to a claim fund(1) and a related compensation mechanism (2) are now foreseen.
In 2014, the Office launched a call for tenders for a four-year framework agreement on a protected market volume of EUR 30 million for the procurement of consulting services covering a wide range of activities, including training, project management, general advisory services and studies.
However, the procurement procedure and the subsequent use of the framework agreement were partly not adequately managed.
The objectives and the procedures had not been defined sufficiently precisely to make a precise assessment of the volume of the framework agreement.
Therefore, the resources of the framework contract were exhausted after only two years and six months.
In addition, despite the variety of services to be procured and the very different expenditures per activity, no lots had been used.
The use of lots would encourage smaller companies to participate in the low-value process.
Finally, the price competition was neutralised and the discretion obtained by the contractor, since fixed price offers were requested by a single contractor using the framework agreement.
The Office should decide to enter into agreements with several suppliers and, if necessary, to call again for competition.
The Office's charter states that the translations required for the Office's work are made by the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union (CdT), which leads to the fact that the Office is the Centre's principal client.
The Office is increasingly using internal solutions such as linguistic and translation memory as well as additional software.
These instruments are designed to improve the cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Office.
However, from the perspective of the European Union, the current situation could lead to a doubling of expenditure and corresponding costs.
2016 In progress (4) 2016 In progress (1) Article 89(1) of its Financial Regulations, the Office shall establish a Complaint Fund, the resources of which shall be the continuation of its activity and the exercise of its responsibilities for one year, i.e. in its entirety corresponding to the appropriations entered in Titles 1, 2 and 3 of the Office's budget.
(2) Article 139 (4) and (6) of its Ordinance on the Protection of the Intellectual Property of the Member States, the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property and any other relevant authority to be designated by a Member State as a functional component of the European Union's trade mark system under various services and procedures only to the extent that no budget deficit arises this year.
(3) In 2017, the Office's budget implementation rate was 97%.
(4) See point 3.34.8.
EN C 434/198 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AMTS COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.34.8.
While the cancellation rate is just over 15%, the amount of cancelled committed transfers is the lowest of the last ten years (since 2008) at EUR 3.2 million.
The Office will continue to work with the national authorities to reduce the cancelled transfers through interim reports on implementation and half-yearly inspections with reinforced control measures, which form an integral part of each new cooperation agreement.
Further measures have also been implemented internally, such as awareness-raising measures through coaching, training, information notes and meetings with financial actors.
Furthermore, before the end of 2017, the Office expected that 15% of cancelled transfers would go over and proactively took additional measures to reduce transfers for the next year.
The Office took note of the Court's observations.
It should be noted in advance that the scenarios described in the procurement documents for the future uses of the contract were aimed at being as vivid and representative as possible and were not expected to be linked in detail to each specific contract.
As regards the adequacy of the re-opening of the competition mechanisms and as stated in the Office's response to the 2016 audit, this concept has already been introduced in the revised framework agreement on audits and studies.
The Office has compared the added value of this mechanism with the related administrative costs and, in view of the Office's intensive use of advisory and project management services, has concluded that this is not the most efficient way to manage the latter types of operations.
Taking into account the fact that the current framework agreement is valid until 2020, the extension of this mechanism to advisory and project management services would require a new tender at this stage, which the Office does not consider appropriate.
In the existing cascade system for consulting and project management services, the Office repeats the answer to the 2016 audit on the use of the fixed price procedures.
The main reason for choosing this option is that the Office is subject to proceedings before the Spanish labour courts in relation to a non-right-hand transfer of employees, which are inter alia related to the use of the former ăTime and Means.
In the case of a fixed price procedure (within the cascade system), the Office has experience in evaluating offers.
The EUIPO has set up a specific team, which is able, on the basis of previous practice and expertise, to include the resources required to carry out the tasks behind the fixed price services.
However, we believe that the Court's concerns can be addressed by other contractual methods than the ăfixed prize, such as the ăQuoted Time and Means, a method that the Office could use in the future to draw on individual cases.
The Office undertakes to provide further information and to document its own estimates of the resources required to carry out the tasks for fixed price services before issuing the request for assistance in order to provide proof of the above-mentioned experience of the Office in advance.

The Committee is responsible for the management of the Single Resolution Fund (hereinafter referred to as the Fund), which was established by the SRM Regulation and is intended to be supportive under the Single Resolution Mechanism.

Payments Jurisdiction of the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.35.8.
Emphasis on a point of view 3.35.9.
Without questioning its rulings in paragraphs 3.35.6-3.35.8, the Court would like to point out that the contributions to the Fund are calculated on the basis of the information sent to the Committee by credit institutions (and some investment firms).
The Court relied on this information when examining the Committee's revenue, but did not rely on its powers.
The SRM Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework to ensure the reliability of the information.
Furthermore, the Committee cannot provide details of the contributions per credit institution calculated on the basis of a risk assessment, since the calculations are not available and include confidential information about other credit institutions.
3.35.10.
Administrative complaints or judicial proceedings between credit institutions and national resolution authorities and the Committee in connection with contributions to the Fund and the Court of Justice of the European Union brought by former shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular Espaol, S.A. following the adoption of the resolution concept, the Court disregarded its examination in order not to affect the position of the parties in these proceedings.
For detailed information, see paragraph 8 of the Committee's annual accounts.
3.35.11.
The following comments do not call into question the Court's ruling. COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.35.12.
The Committee did not ensure that payments were made within the deadlines set.
Some 28% of the payments (9.5% of the total) to contractors and reimbursements to experts and staff were made after compliance.
COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF ACCOUNTS 3.35.13.
Article 92(4) of the SRM Regulation is reported by the Court, in particular, on contingent liabilities arising from the performance of its tasks under this Regulation for the Committee, the Council and the Commission.
According to the preliminary procurement plan annexed to the 2017 Work Programme, contracts for 16 different services should be awarded, but actually only contracts for the provision of legal advice were awarded.
In addition, the estimated contract value for the provision of legal advice in the previous procurement plan was 3 million euros, while the actual order volume amounted to 29 million euros.
This indicates inadequate procurement planning.
3.35.15.
Of the entries for the provision of legal advice in the amount of 29 million euros, 20 million euros were awarded by eleven negotiated procedures without prior publication.
In addition, two grants of EUR 3 million for consultancy and support for economic and financial evaluation (as foreseen in the annual work programme 2016) were also awarded by way of such a procedure.
A blatant use of such methods leads to the restriction of competition.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/201 3.35.16.
In accordance with its financial rules, the Committee should lay down a single regulation for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (263).
As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an overall IT package covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of procurement notices documents in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015). The Committee had not yet introduced any of these tools by the end of 2017.
3.35.17.
The Committee publishes job advertisements on its own website and on social media, but generally not on the website of the European Office for Personnel Selection (EPSO), which would comply with the principle of transparency, which would be raised by the public and which would allow the citizens to see the possibility of job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies.
CONTINUE CONFIDENCE OF COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 3.35.18. The annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
(263) Article 75 of the SRB Financial Regulation of 25 March 2015.
C 434/202 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up to observations from previous years Court observations The Committee took up its activity in 2015 and gradually established its internal control environment.
However, the preparation, adoption or implementation of a number of essential procedures and controls are still pending. The risk management and control strategy, the standards for internal control, the regular evaluation of the proper functioning of the internal control system and the fraud prevention strategy are not included.
The accountant has not yet validated the Committee's accounting system.
Of the available funds, only 62% (2015: 67%) and 35 million euros (2015: 15 million euros) (1) were spent.
The commitment appropriations committed for the following financial year for Title II (administrative expenditure) are EUR 3.1 million and 35% (2015: EUR 3.3 million and 70% respectively) of the total commitment appropriations.
They relate mainly to IT contracts issued in 2016 (1.9 million euros) and security services that have not yet been invoiced and paid for this year (0.6 million euros).
The commitment appropriations for Title III of the budget (operational expenditure) for the following financial year amount to EUR 5.3 million and 66% respectively (2015: EUR 1.6 million and 40% respectively) of the commitment appropriations.
They mainly concern services provided by the European Central Bank (1.9 million euros), legal services (1.5 million euros) and IT services (1.3 million euros), for which payments have to be made in 2017.
Between July and October 2016, the Committee committed EUR 2 million for the procurement of legal services, which were neither planned in the annual work programme nor in the budget, nor was a financing decision adopted before the commitment was made.
Applying the negative interest rate on the deposit facility of the European Central Bank in 2016, the Fund paid negative interest on EUR 24 million (2) to the national central banks.
This reduced the amount of cumulative amounts of future transactions.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/203 EN Court's observations The Committee must carry out its recruitment procedures more closely, set clear minimum scores to be reached by the candidates, and define more precisely the tasks and responsibilities of the members of the selection committee.
The implementation rate for 2016 2017 was 71% and 71 million euros respectively.
50 million euros in 2017.
EN C 434/204 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE COMMITTEE 3.35.9.
The annual contributions to the Fund collected in advance shall be calculated on the basis of the information provided to the Committee by credit institutions and certain investment firms.
Although the SRM Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework that ensures the reliability of this information, the SRF pays any attention to this aspect.
The data provided are based on the data transmitted by the institutions in the previous year and on the data contained in the ECB database.
Deviations are reported to the national resolution authorities who are asked to clarify the facts. Thus, it was possible for the SRF to improve the quality of the data in the previous cycles.
Furthermore, the Committee cannot disclose any details of pre-investigations per institution, calculated on the basis of a risk assessment, as the calculations are not available and therefore confidential information about other institutions would be disclosed.
However, the SRF has disclosed the calculation method as well as detailed calibrations to ensure transparency and cooperation.
3.35.12.
In 2017, due to a combination of unexpectedly high workload, unfortunate staff turnover in the financial team and general difficulties in finding experienced employees, the financial team's capacity was not sufficient to ensure the efficient handling of all financial transactions, including invoices.
Since the fourth quarter of 2017, the team's capacity has been increased and measures have been taken to ensure the timely processing of invoices.
By this date, almost 98 % of the invoices were settled in 2018 within the set deadlines.
Every case of late payment is now being closely investigated in order to achieve further improvements in this area.
3.35.14.
The SRB for 2017's preliminary procurement plan was adopted in 2016, when the Committee was only in its second full year of existence.
At that time, no resolution cases had been dealt with and the Agency had little experience on the basis of which its procurement plan could be drawn up.
As a new agency, the SRB was able to use various interinstitutional frameworks managed by the European Commission.
This led to the fact that several procurement procedures, which were to be initiated by the SRB in 2017, were ultimately not carried out.
In 2018, the implementation of the procurement plan will be closely monitored and additional efforts will be made to improve the planning of procurement procedures.
In 2017, the SRB spent a total of 20 million euros on providing legal advice.
Almost all the negotiated procedures without prior publication of a contract notice concerned disputes (eight out of ten transactions in the total value of EUR 10.9 million), which did not fall within the scope of Directive 2014/24/EU.
This also includes a large number of disputes brought before the ECJ after the first resolution procedure of the SRB.
The SRB does not therefore consider that it uses such methods in a similar way.
As regards the economic and financial valuation of two of the two cases in 2017, the re-implementation of a competition proved to be unsuccessful. Therefore, the SRB was forced to resort to negotiating procedures.
Due to the subject matter of the contract and the need for the highest level of confidentiality, the contract notice was not published in accordance with the applicable rules.
3.35.16.
The online access to tender documents has been available to economic operators since the Committee was established on the SRB website and has been fully integrated into the electronic tender platform since the end of 2017.
In June 2017, the SRB requested that the electronic submission of offers also be made use of. However, the Commission has not yet gained access.
The SRB has found that such publications on the EPSO website do not raise the quality or the number of applications and are also very expensive due to the mandatory translation of job advertisements.
Therefore, the SRB publishes its job advertisements preferably on its own website as well as on EU_CV online and LinkedIn and informs its stakeholders (central banks, finance ministries, national authorities, other EU agencies and permanent representatives).

Note 3.36.7.
The Centre's task is to provide the EU's agencies and bodies with translation services which they can use for their service activities, and it also serves in relation to the institutions of the EU which can use the Centre's services.
Most agencies and institutions are required to make use of the Centre's translation services.
Some agencies and institutions (more than half of the Centre's revenue) are increasingly resorting to in-house opportunities or other alternatives to the rest.
However, this means that the capacity of the Centre is not used to the maximum, that there is a duplication in the development of systems and running costs at the European level, and that the business model and the business development of the Centre can be carried out.
In 2017, an external assessment of the adequacy of the Centre's business model was carried out.

The agencies should establish a uniform framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (269) (270).
As a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT package which covers all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Centre had introduced electronic invoicing for certain procedures, but not the electronic tendering and submission of tenders.

In 2016, the cash and short-term bank deposits of the Centre went up to 34.2 million euros (end of 2015: 38.3 million euros). Reserves decreased to 31.1 million euros (end of 2015: 34 million euros). This decline is the result of a budgetary approach aimed at reducing the surplus accumulated in previous years (2).

The accountant is independent in the performance of his accounting duties.
This independence is ensured by the fact that it is appointed by the Board of Directors and that its position is permanent.
In order to increase the independence of the auditor, he will be directly subordinated to the Director of the Centre from 2018 onwards for the duties of the auditor, and his annual assessment will be carried out by the Director.

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.37.8.
The head of the Agency's accountant is the head of the Finance, Accounting and Programming Department.
In line with the Financial Regulation, the executive agencies should establish a uniform format for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (276). Given that a corresponding specification also applies to the EU institutions and agencies, the Commission is currently developing an IT overview covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents on contract notices in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.37.10.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service presented audit reports in 2017 on the management of recovery orders for funds due to competition disputes (including collateral for funds due to competition disputes) and recovery orders in the context of the Commission's corrective capacity, as well as on phase 1 of the grant management in relation to the Erasmus+ and Creative Europe programmes (277).
The Agency has drawn up an action plan to take corrective action in areas where there is a potential need for improvement.

At EUR 2.3 million and 47 % respectively (2015: EUR 2.8 million and 50 %), the rate of committed appropriations carried over to the following financial year was high for Title III (support for operational activities of the Agency).
These transfers mainly concern current invoices for projects (0.8 million euros) and IT services (0.9 million euros) commissioned in 2016 but not yet invoiced at the end of the year, or which will not be delivered until 2017.
Year 2016 2016 State of adoption of correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
EN C 434/212 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.37.8. The Agency considers that its accountant has a high degree of independence.
In addition to the appointment by the Steering Committee and the function-related injunction against the Committee, it should be noted that EACEA's invoicing officer, as a second member of the Commission's staff, is, per se, much more independent than on-the-spot invoicing officers.
This constellation makes the seconded accountant part of the organizational structure of the superordinate DG, in our case DG EAC.
The Agency will analyse the Court's comment, taking into account potential actions taken by other EU agencies and/or Commission organisational guidelines.
As the agency's top management level carries out changes, the matter will be submitted to the future director for examination.
3.37.9.
The Agency follows the Commission's e-procurement project strictly.
It plans to start the electronic tender (e-tendering) in July 2018, which will follow the procedure for the electronic submission of tenders (e-submission).
3.37.10.
Both measures have now been sent to and accepted by the Internal Audit Service.
It should be noted that all planned measures have now been implemented.

We have (a) audited the Agency's annual accounts, consisting of the annual accounts (280) and the financial implementation reports (281) for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and (b) the legality and regularity of the financial statements underlying them, in accordance with Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Agency's annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017 constitute the Agency's financial and financial position as at 31 December 2017, the results of its accounts and cash flows and the changes in net revenue for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 in accordance with its financial rules and the accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer, which are based on internationally recognised accounting grounds for the public sector, in all essential respects.

COMMENTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENCY 3.38.8.
In the course of this year's examination of these EU agencies, the Court analysed the accounting system, including the hierarchical position and the independence of the accountants, as well as the aspect of the timely (re)validation of the accounting systems.
The head of the agency's accountant is the head of the financial department.
The Court therefore considers it necessary to strengthen the independence of the accountant by directing it to the Director (administrative concerns) and to the Agency's Steering Committee (functional concerns).
3.38.9.
In addition, the Agency's mandate was substantially expanded in 2014: it is now managing EU actions in various areas in cooperation with seven Commission Directorates-General.
Despite major changes in the Agency's procedures and a significant increase in its budget and staff, a revalidation of the accounting system took place most recently in 2012.
In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the executive agencies should establish a uniform solution for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (282). As a corresponding requirement also applies to EU institutions and agencies, the Commission is currently developing an IT summary comprising all stages of public procurement procedures. It has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of documents for contract notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.38.11.
In 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service issued expert reports on the management of COSME (the programme for the competitiveness of companies and small and medium-sized enterprises) by the Agency and the management procedures of the Agency's Human Resources Department(283).
The Agency has prepared action plans in order to take remedial action in areas where there is a potential need for improvement.
CONTINUE CONFERENCE OF COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARs 3.38.12. The annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken in the light of the Court's observations from previous years. (282) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95(2) Electronic Administration (ăe-Government)
(283) The court did not carry out this inspection work.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/215 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Court observations The rate of committed appropriations for the following financial year was high for both Title II (administrative expenditure) of EUR 1 250 000 and 33% (2015: EUR 998 324 and 14% respectively) and Title III (support for the Agency's operational activities) of EUR 2 550 000 and 62% (2015: EUR 4 million and 65% respectively).
Under Title II, the transfers were mainly related to rent (0.6 million euros) and the purchase of hardware that had not yet been delivered at the end of the year (0.5 million euros).
The funds transferred under Title III concerned the evaluation and monitoring of the LIFE programme by external experts (EUR 1.5 million), ongoing ex-post inspections (EUR 0.5 million) and IT services (EUR 0.5 million), which were commissioned in 2016, but only partially delivered at the end of the year and have not yet been invoiced.
The Agency may apply separate budget allocations to better meet the multi-annual nature of the activities and inevitable delays between contract signings, deliveries and payments.
The high cancellation rate of the previous year's appropriations for Title I (staff expenditure) amounted to EUR 32000, or 8.3%, shows that the appropriations needed were overestimated.
Year 2016 2016 State of acceptance of correction (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
EN C 434/216 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.38.8.
The Agency considers that its internal control system provides sufficient security to ensure effective separation of duties and the independence of the accountant.
The accounting officer was appointed by the Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee shall adopt the provisional and final accounts, the administrative budget and any further changes.
The principal services to be provided by the accountant shall be approved by the Director.
In the Agency's opinion, a change in the current reporting and organisational structure would not have a decisive impact on the risks and controls of accounting procedures.
However, the Agency will closely monitor the situation and adjust the organisational and reporting requirements where necessary.
3.38.9. The accounting team started to validate the accounting systems in December 2017 and will complete them in 2018.
3.38.10.
In the field of procurement, the agency has introduced electronic invoicing for certain IT providers since 2013, including complete electronic processing and an automated interface to the ABAC workflow.
From 2018 onwards, electronic invoicing will be further promoted and gradually applied to other suppliers, depending on their infrastructure and electronic equipment.

The ill-fated reports concerned the transparency of these procedures.
In its September 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the Agency has taken a number of strategic and operational measures to improve the recruitment, retention and allocation of its staff.
In this context, IAS concluded that the Agency has designed and implemented an appropriate human resources management system to enable a competent and committed workforce to achieve its objectives.
Although no critical or particularly serious problems were identified, the Agency and IAS agreed on an action plan to further improve this procedure in certain areas.
At EUR 1.3 million or 40% (2015: EUR 1.5 million or 43%), the rate of committed appropriations for Title III (operational expenditure) carried over to the following financial year remained high, mainly due to year-on-year external inspections and communication measures.
The high transfer rate is in contradiction to the budgetary principle of annuality.
Year 2016 2016 2016 Balance of correction acceptance (completed/in progress/outgoing/ n.e.c.)
EN C 434/220 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.39.8. The electronic submission of tenders is currently limited to open procedures (the threshold is set by Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement and amounted to EUR 135 000 in 2017).
Since the Agency did not initiate such a procedure in 2017, and this will not be the case in 2018, the Agency was unable to use the electronic submission of tenders in 2017.
Moreover, the use of electronic submissions will become mandatory under the Commission's Roadmap at the end of 2018 for all EU institutions and agencies.
Therefore, the start-up process was started in 2018, and the agency will be able to deploy the electronic submission of tenders before the end of the year.
In the case of negotiated procedures, the Agency will use the electronic submission of tenders once the Commission has integrated this option into the module.
3.39.9.
In accordance with the Action Plan drawn up by the Agency and approved by the IAS in respect of the implementation of FP7 projects, all measures were implemented by the ERCEA and submitted to the Internal Audit Service (IAS) on 9 April 2018 for follow-up.

The following remarks do not call into question the Court's judgment.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.41.8.
There are weaknesses in the management of the selection process for contract staff.
The recruitment files and minutes of the selection committee meetings do not always contain the criteria used for selecting candidates from the recruitment database (304).
In the context of the Financial Regulation, the executive agencies should establish a single framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (305).
As a requirement also applies to EU institutions and agencies, the Commission is currently developing an IT package covering all stages of public procurement procedures. It launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of procurement notices documents in the online edition of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
REPORTS OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES 3.41.10.
In May 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) presented a report on the completion of FP7 projects at REA (306).
The Agency drew up an action plan to address areas where there is a potential need for improvement.
The annex contains an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years.
(304) In addition, reference is made to the report on the Agency's human resources management presented by the Commission's Internal Audit Service in 2016.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/227 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Statements by the Court In its December 2016 audit report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the Agency's overall human resources management is appropriate.
The Agency and IAS agreed on a plan for the correction of the finding included in the report.
In another May 2016 audit report, IAS concluded that the Agency, together with the Commission, has set up an efficient internal control system for managing the grants granted under the Horizon 2020 programme.
The Agency and IAS agreed with the Commission on a plan for corrective measures to be considered to be very important.
The performance of the Agency has been subject to an external evaluation on behalf of the Commission during the period 2012-2015, for which the final report was submitted in May 2016.
The conclusion of the evaluation is that the Agency has carried out its tasks in an effective, efficient and cost-effective manner in the period under consideration, that its mission for the Commission and the managers of the Agency is still relevant for the first time and that the transfer of operational tasks from the Commission to the Agency has been successful.
The evaluation experts, however, also made possible even more effective and efficient ways of shaping the activities. The Agency and the Commission were invited to improve their internal dialogue and cooperation, communication according to requirements and certain aspects in the area of IT and human resources management.
The Agency and the Commission agreed on a plan for corrective action.
EN C 434/228 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY 3.41.9
The introduction of the restricted recruitment procedure, where weaknesses were identified, took place in 2016. A reserve list was then drawn up and adopted in 2016, which was used in 2017 to provide a job offer.
The selection process of REA for contract staff has been revised and implemented in 2017, taking into account the recommendation of the IAS of 2016.
The revised competition for contract staff takes into account the demands for clearly documented search criteria for living life and mobility, as well as for admission and selection criteria.
The search criteria used by the selection boards for the sighting of life documents are documented in their minutes.
Thus, the weaknesses raised by the Court in the amended procedure have already been removed.
In the area of procurement, REA relies on service agreements with the Commission or on the Commission's framework contracts.
REA would only initiate a special procurement procedure if there is a special need not covered by these agreements or contracts.
In 2017, REA only carried out a procurement procedure for a low-value contract.
The current tools for electronic tendering and the electronic submission of tenders are only applicable for public procurement procedures, the size of which is above the 144,000 euro threshold. As the REA has not yet launched a procurement procedure, the size of which is above this threshold, it was unable to use the tools for electronic tendering and the electronic submission of tenders in 2017.
Furthermore, the introduction of the electronic tender and electronic submission of offers in accordance with the Commission's roadmap for all EU institutions and agencies will be mandatory at the end of 2018, and thus the implementation process did not begin until 2018.
The Agency is already using electronic invoicing and will also use the modules for the electronic tendering and the electronic submission of tenders when launching a tender procedure, as soon as these modules also cover medium and low value entries.

According to our assessment, the revenue on which the annual accounts are based for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 is legal and regular in all essential respects.
Payments Jurisdiction of the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the annual accounts 3.42.6.
Emphasis on a situation 3.42.7.
The Agency's accountant has been absent since the end of November 2017.
On 13 December 2017, the Agency's Steering Committee appointed a Management Board as ad interim accounting officer, despite the fact that this Board represents the authorising officer in charge.
This is contrary to Article 28 of the Agency's financial regulations, according to which powers of instruction and accounting are separate functions and exclude each other.
3.42.8.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.42.9.
In 2017, the Agency did not provide sufficient documentation on recruitment procedures.
This could call into question the principles of transparency and equal treatment of applicants.
In 2017, the Agency had difficulties in reaching a sufficient number of tenderers in low and medium value procurement procedures.
It received only one offer for each of the tested procedures.
3.42.11.
In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the executive agencies should establish a single framework for the electronic storage and exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (311).
3.42.12.
The Agency publishes job advertisements for temporary staff on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which would provide transparency and publicity and enable the workers to consult job advertisements issued by the various European institutions and agencies. COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY CURRENCY 3.42.13.
The Agency's budgeting has been weak. In the case of Title III of the budget, large amounts of committed appropriations were transferred from 2017 to 2018 at EUR 1.6 million or 63% (2016: EUR 1.2 million or 48%).
CONTINUATION OF COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 342.14.
The Annex provides an overview of the corrective measures taken on the basis of the Court's observations from previous years. (311) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95(2) Electronic Administration (ăe-Government).
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/231 EN ANNEX Follow-up to comments from previous years Statements by the Court The Agency cancelled EUR 0.2 million or 18% of its funds transferred to 2015 (2014: EUR 0.1 million or 14% respectively), which indicates M-angel in its planning.
The Agency transferred EUR 1.1 million or 48% (2015: EUR 0.9 million or 52%) of the appropriations committed under Title III (expenditure related to the Agency's activity) to the following financial year.
These transfers mainly concern IT services as well as other studies commissioned, but which have not yet been completed or completed by the end of the year.
The Agency cancelled EUR 0.2 million and 17% of the funds transferred from 2015 to 2016, which indicates an inadequate planning of needs.

EN C 434/232 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 REPLY OF THE AGENCY REPRESENTATION OF A BEHAVIOUR 3.42.7 The annual accounts have been drawn up and signed by the appointed and re-in-office auditor.The separation of duties will be strictly observed in the future.
3.42.9. The Agency accepts the Court's observation that the recruitment file analysed by the Court was not adequately documented.
However, the CHAFEA ensured that no candidate was preferred in this selection process, as all candidates were treated equally.
3.42.10.
The CHAFEA carried out all the steps recommended in the Financial Regulation in these two low and medium-value contracts: the ex-ante announcement took place as required, and the legally prescribed number of applicants was invited to submit an offer, with all candidates having a lot of experience with invitations to tender and the desired services.
As regards the time allocated to bidders to submit their bid, CHAFEA adhered to DG BUDGET's Vademecum for procurement.
CHAFEA is currently testing several IT modules for electronic procurement, including the electronic submission of tenders.
The first tender, where tenders are submitted electronically, will be tested in the third quarter of 2018.
CHAFEA will fully comply with the European Commission's recommendation to implement the electronic bid submission system before the end of 2018.
The CHAFEA agrees with the observation that the publication of job advertisements for temporary agents on the EPSO website can increase its visibility. 3.42.13.
The Agency accepts the Court's observations.
The agency will continue to reduce the transfer and the C8 cancellation rate further.

EN 10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/7 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 0.1.
The European Court of Auditors is the institution responsible for auditing the finances of the European Union (EU) in accordance with the Treaty.
As an external auditor of the EU, we contribute to improving EU financial management while acting as independent guardians of the financial interests of EU citizens.
More detailed information on our work can be found in the Annual Activity Report, which is available on our website www.eca.europa.eu, as well as the special reports on the EU's expenditure programmes and revenue and the opinions on new or amended legislation.
This is our 38th annual report on the implementation of the EU budget; it concerns the financial year 2014.
The annual report on the European Development Funds shall be presented separately.
0.3.
The general budget of the EU is adopted annually by the Council and the European Parliament.
Our annual report, together with the special reports, forms the basis for the discharge procedure, during which the European Parliament, following a Council recommendation, decides whether the Commission has carried out its budget implementation tasks satisfactorily.
At the same time as transmission to the European Parliament and the Council, we are sending our annual report to the national parliaments.
0.4.
The main element of our annual report is the statement on the reliability of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union and on the legality and regularity of transactions (hereinafter referred to as ‘the regularity of transactions').
We complement this Statement of Assurance with specific assessments of all major EU activities.
0.5.
The chapter structure now reflects the headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), which makes our report even more relevant.
The financial framework entered into force in 2014 and is intended to determine the extent and distribution of EU expenditure for the period up to 2020.
This should make it easier for readers to establish a link between the findings of our report and the relevant budgetary and accounting information.
0.6.
There are no separate financial statements for each of the MFF headings and, therefore, the conclusions submitted in the context of specific assessments do not form an audit opinion.
0.7.
This year's report is structured as follows: — Chapter 1 contains the Statement of Assurance and a summary of the results of our audit on the reliability of the accounts and the regularity of operations. — Chapter 2 presents our findings on budgetary and financial management. — Chapter 3 contributes to our strategic objective of improving the EU's public accountability. The focus is on the extent to which the performance framework enables the Commission to monitor and manage progress towards Europe 2020. — Chapter 4 contains our findings on revenue. — Chapters 5 to 9 (to the MFF headings 1a, 1b, 2, 4 and 5)(1) show the results of our audits on the regularity of operations, as well as the audit of selected systems and annual activity reports.
0.8.
The Commission's replies (or, where appropriate, the replies of other EU institutions and bodies) to our comments are contained in the report. Our findings and conclusions are based on the replies of the audited body.
As an external auditor, however, it is our sole task to present our audit findings, to draw conclusions from these findings and thus to make an independent and impartial assessment of the reliability of the accounts and the regularity of the transactions.
(1) We do not provide specific assessments of expenditure under the MFF Headings 3 (security and citizenship) and 6 (compensation payments).

DE C 373/10 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL RELIABILITY DECLARATION OF THE COURT — REMARKS OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITERS I. We have examined: (a) the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union, the consolidated annual accounts(1) and the aggregated financial statements (2) for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 and approved by the Commission on 23 July 2015, and (b) the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts referred to in Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
Management II's responsibility In accordance with Articles 317 and 318 TFEU and the Financial Regulation, the Commission is responsible for the preparation and proper presentation of the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union on the basis of internationally recognised public sector accounting principles and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
This responsibility includes the design, establishment and maintenance of internal control structures necessary for the preparation and presentation of financial statements that are free from material misrepresentations, intended or unintended.
The Commission shall bear the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the European Union (Article 317 TFEU).
Responsibility of the auditor III. Our task is to provide the European Parliament and the Council, on the basis of our audit, with a statement of the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them.
We have carried out our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing as well as the professional conduct requirements of IFAC and the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions of INTOSAI.
According to these standards, we have to comply with the professional behavioural requirements and to plan and carry out the audit in such a way that sufficient certainty is obtained as to whether the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union are free of material misrepresentations and the underlying transactions are lawful and proper.
IV. An audit shall include the carrying out of audit proceedings in order to obtain audit evidence of the valuations and other information contained in the consolidated annual accounts and of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The selection of audit acts is at the discretion of the auditor, including the assessment of the risks of material — intentional or unintended — misrepresentation in the consolidated accounts and of material — intentional or unintended infringements of European Union legislation in the underlying transactions.
When assessing these risks, the auditor shall take into account all internal controls relevant to the preparation and proper presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in order to plan audit actions that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not with the aim of delivering an audit opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control system.
An audit shall also include an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting policies applied, the representativeness of the estimated values in the accounting and the overall presentation of the consolidated annual accounts.
V. In the field of revenue, we use the macro-economic aggregates relevant for their calculation as the starting point for our review of own resources based on VAT and derived from gross national income and evaluate the Commission's systems of processing these data until the Member States' contributions are received and until they are identified in the consolidated annual accounts.
In the area of traditional own resources, we examine the accounts of customs authorities and analyse the tax flows until they are received by the Commission and until the amounts are recorded in the accounts.
1. The consolidated financial statements shall include the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the cash flow account, the changes in net assets and a summary of important accounting rules and other explanatory notes (including segment reporting).
DE 10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/11 VI. In the area of expenditure, we will review the payment transactions after the expenditure has been incurred, recorded and accepted. This review will take place on all types of payments, except advances, (including payments for the acquisition of assets) only after they have been made.
Advance payments shall be considered if the beneficiary provides or is required to provide proof of their proper use and the advance is settled or can be recovered.
VII. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to serve as the basis for our audit opinions.
The reliability of the accounts Audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts VIII. In our opinion, the consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year ending 31 December 2014 constitute the financial and financial situation of the Union as at 31 December 2014, the results of its operations and its cash flows and the changes in net assets for the financial year ending on that date in accordance with the Financial Regulation and the accounting rules for the public sector based on internationally recognised accounting principles in all essential respects as a whole. The legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the annual accounts Revenues Payments Audit opinion on the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the annual accounts IX. In our opinion, the revenue underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 is lawful and proper in all essential respects.
The basis for the failed audit opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts X. The expenditure booked in 2014 to the detriment of headings 1 to 4 of the multiannual financial framework (3) covering operational appropriations is substantially affected by errors.
Our estimated error rate for payments underlying the annual accounts is 4.4%.
Our conclusion is underpinned by the analysis of risk amounts presented by the Commission in the synthesis report.
Failure of an audit opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts XI. According to our assessment, the facts underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 are substantially affected by errors due to the significance of the facts described in paragraph "The basis for the failed audit opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts".
3. These headings shall be dealt with in Chapters 5 to 8 of this Annual Report.
10 September 2015 Mr Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President European Court of Auditors 12, rue Alcide De Gasperi, 1615 Luxembourg, LUXEMBOURG
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/13 DE OBSERVATIONS OF THE COURT INTRODUCTION EU expenditure is an important instrument for achieving policy objectives 1.1.
EU expenditure is an important instrument for achieving policy objectives.
Other important instruments include legislation, the free movement of goods, services and capital and the free movement of persons throughout the Union.
On average, EU expenditure amounts to 1.9% of total government expenditure in the EU Member States (see Figure 1.1).
According to the Treaty, our role is, inter alia, to assess whether the use of the EU budget is in line with the relevant laws and other legislation; — to give our audit opinion on the annual accounts of the EU; — to report on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness (4) of EU expenditure; — to submit opinions on legislative proposals with financial implications.
With our audit work to support the Statement of Assurance, we meet the first and second of these objectives.
This audit work allows us to identify risks that affect economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
It also provides an important input to the opinions we give on proposed financial regulations.
(4) In Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union (OJ L 347, 20.12.2012, p.
1), these terms are defined as follows: "The principle of economy requires that the resources used by the institution concerned in its [sic] activities be made available at the right time, in sufficient quantity and appropriate quality and with the lowest possible cost.
The principle of economic efficiency concerns the optimal relationship between the resources used and the results achieved.
The principle of effectiveness concerns the achievement of certain objectives and the desired results.

OBSERVATIONS OF THE COURT 1.3.
In this chapter of the Annual Report, we provide background information on the Statement of Assurance and an overview of our audit approach (see Annex 1.1), our audit findings and conclusions; — we analyse the nature of the various risks associated with EU expenditure; — we describe the measures taken by the Commission following comments and recommendations on the reliability of the accounts presented in previous annual reports (see Annex 1.2).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/15 DE OBSERVATIONS OF THE HOFES BUDGETARY PRESENTATIONS FOR 2014 The annual accounts did not show any material misrepresentations at 1.4.
Our comments refer to the consolidated annual accounts (5) (the ‘annual accounts') of the European Union for the financial year 2014.
We received the annual accounts together with the accounting officer's declaration of completeness on 23 July 2015 (6).
The annual accounts are accompanied by an analysis document on the financial statements "Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis(7)", which is not the subject of our audit opinion.
However, in accordance with audit principles, we have verified its consistency with the information contained in the annual accounts.

The annual accounts (see extracts in Annex 1.3) show that the total liabilities as at 31 December 2014 amounted to EUR 220.7 billion compared to a total assets of EUR 162.7 billion.
The 2014 economic result shows a deficit of EUR 11.3 billion (see also points 2.12-2.13).
Our audit showed that the annual accounts did not show any material misrepresentations (see also Annex 1.2).
Our comments on the EU's financial management and management are set out in Chapter 2.
(5) The consolidated annual accounts shall consist of: (a) the consolidated annual accounts, which comprise the balance sheet (in which assets and liabilities are presented at the end of the year), the profit and loss account (in which income and expenses of the year are shown), the cash flow account (in which changes in the accounts affect the cash and cash equivalents) and the changes in net assets, together with the accompanying explanatory notes; (b) the aggregated financial statements covering revenue and expenditure for the financial year, together with comments.
(6) The provisional accounts were received by us on 31 March 2015, together with the accounting officer's declaration of completeness, which is the final date for transmission in accordance with the Financial Regulation (see Article 147 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012).
The final annual accounts were received eight days before the deadline laid down in Article 148 for the transmission of 31 July.
The revised analytical document on the financial statements of the Commission's Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis was submitted to the Court on 1 September 2015.

C 373/16 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.7.
In 2014, the Commission amended the presentation of the annual accounts several times.
These amendments are intended to take account of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and to achieve further alignment with international standards.
Considerable improvements have been made in the presentation of certain explanatory notes to the financial statements (8).
Points affecting the annual accounts 1.8.
The following points have an impact on the annual accounts: 1.8. a) The Commission has made progress with regard to the presentation of (a) explanatory note 6 on the annual accounts (on ‘protection of the EU budget'), as discussed in point 1.13 of our annual report on the financial year 2013 and in point 2 of this year's follow-up report (Annex 1.2).
The explanation now contains more targeted information.
In the area of cohesion, it identifies the extent to which corrections are made before expenditure is recorded, during implementation and at closure.
Furthermore, the explanation now includes a description of the impact of corrective measures (such as the creation of assigned revenue, expenditure withdrawn and replaced by Member States, etc.) on the EU budget, although not always in a quantified form (9). (b) Note 2.5.2 on pre-financing (commitments to Member States) shows that there is limited information available to the Commission on the use of the resources available for financial instruments under shared management (EUR 3.8 billion) and other aid schemes (EUR 3.6 billion).
The Commission may need to make significant adjustments at the end of the 2007-2013 programming period.
(8) Including a consolidated presentation of short-term and long-term assets and liabilities and a simplified presentation of segment reporting.
(9) In its explanatory note 6 to the 2015 financial statements, the Commission seeks to take account of the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union of June 2015, which annulled decisions on financial corrections amounting to EUR 457 million.
In the statement 2.10 ‘Reserves', these decisions are already treated as adjustments due to events after the closing date (Court of Justice judgment of 24 June 2015 in Joined Cases C-549/12 P and C-54/13 P annulment of two Commission decisions of EUR 94 million in connection with ERDF programmes in Germany and judgment in Case C-263/13 P annulment of three Commission decisions of EUR 363 million in respect of ERDF programmes in Spain).
These decisions were taken in connection with the expenditure under the 1994-1999 operational programmes.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION C 373/17 DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES The regularity of transactions: Although our general examination results are stable, they indicate a material error rate 1.9.
We are examining the EU's revenue and expenditure in order to assess whether they are in line with the relevant laws and other legislation.
We present our audit results on the receipts in Chapters 4 and on expenditure in Chapters 5 to 9 (see Table 1.1).
1.10.
Revenue was not significantly affected by errors (see point 4.26).
As regards expenditure, we still find a significant error rate.
At 4.4 %, the estimated error rate in expenditure (after taking into account the relevant corrective measures, see point 1.32 (10)) was similar to that in 2013 (4.5% (11)) (see Table 1.1).
Expenditure in the MFF heading 5 (administration) was not significantly affected by errors (see paragraph 9.15).
For all other operational expenditure headings, expenditure was substantially affected by errors (see points 5.32-5.33, 6.76-6.77, 7.72-7.73 and 8.26-8.27).

However, the audit work in these areas contributes to our overall conclusion on expenditure for 2014. Source: European Court of Auditors.
COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.11.
Overall, the test results over the last three years have remained relatively stable at a level well above our baseline for materiality (see Figure 1.2).
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.11.
The Commission notes that the error rate reported by the Court is an annual estimate which takes account of the accounting corrections of project expenditure made before the Court's audit is announced.
The Commission notes that it is bound by the Financial Regulation, which lays down in Article 32(2)(e) that its internal control system should ensure, inter alia, ‘appropriate treatment of the risks related to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multi-annual nature of the programmes and the nature of the payments concerned'.
In the 2014 synthesis report (COM(2015) 279 final), the Commission estimated the future impact of correction mechanisms to be EUR 2.7 billion, corresponding to 1.9% of payments from the EU budget.
The Commission will continue to exercise its monitoring role by making financial corrections and recoveries at a level consistent with the level of irregularities and inadequacies identified throughout the period and also after the closure of the programmes.

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.12.
EU expenditure consists mainly of two types of expenditure programmes which have different risk patterns (12): — programmes based on payment entitlements, for which payment depends on whether certain conditions are met; such programmes include scholarships for students and research grants (Chapter 5), direct aid to farmers (Chapter 7), direct budget support(13) (Chapter 8) and salaries and pensions (Chapter 9); — reimbursement schemes, for which the EU reimburses eligible costs for eligible activities, include research projects (Chapter 5), schemes for investment in regional and rural development (Chapters 6 and 7), training programmes (Chapter 6) and development projects (Chapter 8).
(12) Paragraphs 1.20-1.22 detail these different risks.
(13) Budget support payments are a contribution to the general budget of a State or to the funds provided by it for a specific policy or objective (see also paragraphs 8.7 and 8.8).
THE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFE A new audit approach...
For 2014, we have redesigned our approach to quantify serious breaches of procurement rules.
This approach clarifies how we assess the impact of these infringements.
In particular, we have introduced a proportional approach to the calculation of errors related to the modification of contracts.
1.14.
In order to ensure comparability of the results presented in this report, we have adjusted the figures for 2012 and 2013 in Table 1.1 and in Figures 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 in line with this new approach.
Annex 1.4 contains the unadjusted historical data on the estimated error rates for the period 2009-2013.
This adjustment reduced the estimated overall error rate by 0,2 % in 2013 and by 0,3 % in 2012.
The adjustment does not affect the conclusions we reached in relation to those years, and it continues to be a clearly significant error rate.
1.15.
In 2015, we will adapt our approach to cross compliance with the revised legal framework for the common agricultural policy.
While we will continue to report on the information provided by the Commission on cross-compliance, this element will no longer be the subject of our audit proceedings.
This year we identified numerous cross-compliance errors with regard to one in four of the farms visited.
The share of these errors in our estimated total error rate is 0.2 percentage points (2013: 0.2)(14) and the error rate for the chapter ‘Natural resources' is 0.6 percentage points (2013: 0.5).
The Commission welcomes the change in the Court's approach from 2015.
For 2014, it reiterates its view that cross compliance infringements do not affect the eligibility conditions for payments (see the Commission's reply to point 7.7).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/21 DE COMMENTS OF THE HOFES... and a new structure for our annual report 1.16.
As described in the general introduction (point 0.5.0.7), we have redesigned the chapter structure of our annual report.
For the purpose of comparability, it is illustrated below (Figure 1.3) what the audit results of the last year would look like if both the new chapter structure and the new approach had been used to quantify infringements of procurement rules (see paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14).
We used these figures in Table 1.1.

1.17.
As can be seen from Figure 1.4, the cohesion area contributes most to our estimated 2014 error rate, followed by the ‘Natural resources', ‘Competitiveness' and ‘Europe in the world'.
This distribution is in line with our findings for 2013.

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.18.
Eligibility errors in the reimbursement schemes account for the main part of the errors detected for 2014 (see also points 1.20-1.22, Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6). (a) The estimated error rate for expenditure reimbursement is 5.5 % (2013: 5.6 %).
Typical errors in this area include: — inclusion of ineligible costs in cost statements, — ineligible projects, activities or beneficiaries, — serious infringements of procurement rules during the procurement process, — serious infringements of procurement rules during the execution of contracts (i.e. modifications to contracts and additional works).
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.18. a) The Commission has also identified similar problems in its audits.
During the 2007-2013 programming period, significant efforts have been made by the Commission to identify the real cause of the problems and, where appropriate, to implement corrective measures.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/23 DE HOFES OBSERVATIONS b) For payment entitlement-based programmes, the estimated error rate is 2.7% (2013: 3.0%).
Typical errors in this area include: — excessive area data by farmers; — administrative errors in payments made to farmers.
Figure 1.5 — Share of the estimated total error rate by type of error Source: European Court of Auditors.
1.19.
The figures for 2013 in Figure 1.5 were drawn up on the same basis as for 2014, i.e. on the basis of the approach described in point 1.13.
C 373/24 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION OF THE COMMENTS ON THE HOFES Type of expenditure and error rates are closely related to 1.20.
We have analysed the relationship between the type of expenditure and the risk of error.
The extent to which the correct calculation of payments to beneficiaries depends on information provided by beneficiaries themselves is characteristic of EU expenditure.
This applies to the largest category of expenditure schemes based on payment entitlements: the area-related aid paid to farmers.
This is of particular importance in the area of reimbursement schemes: beneficiaries must provide information in their application in order to demonstrate that they are participating in an eligible measure and that they have incurred costs which are eligible for reimbursement.
All types of management are affected (15).
1.21.
Figure 1.6 is based on all audits carried out in relation to EU expenditure over the last two years, both for the annual reports on the general budget and for the European Development Funds (16).
The cash flows are grouped according to their nature.
The size of the circles in this figure represents the respective proportion of total expenditures, with their respective positioning along the 45-degree line indicating the corresponding estimated error rate; their colour indicates whether they are claims-based or reimbursement-based expenditures.
1.22.
This figure contains both elements of mandatory discretion (assessment of the effects of systems and risks related to the type of operation — see Annex 1.1, point 1) and empirical elements (measurement of estimated error rates during a two-year period).
Firstly, this is intended to meet the needs of our target group for more information on the different risk profiles, and secondly, to assist the Commission in taking action in areas with persistently high error rates.
1.20.
The integrated management and control system (InVeKoS), which includes the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), contributes significantly to avoiding errors and reducing the error rate (see point 7.32).
LPIS is established and maintained by the national authorities.
Payments to final beneficiaries are only possible after their claim has been compared with the data available in the area identification system.
LPIS means that the error rate for area-related aid is lower than for all other types of aid under shared management.
The Commission considers that Box 1.2 and Box 1.3 confirm this view.
(15) Direct management (budgets directly carried out by the European Commission), indirect management (non-EU partner countries, international organisations, etc.) and shared management (shared budget implementation between the Commission and Member States).
(16) Evaluation based on the same approach for both years (see points 1.13 and 1.14).
DE 10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/25 Figure 1.6 — Link between type of operation, risk and estimated error rate for EU operations (2013-2014) (1) Reimbursement for the heading ‘Europe in the world' includes projects funded by several donors, to which many characteristics of payment entitlement-based schemes apply in practice and which have lower error rates.
C 373/26 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES The results in the various areas of expenditure show different error patterns 1.23. "Competitiveness" (Chapter 5): The estimated error rate is 5.6% and is therefore higher than the corresponding results for 2013 (4.0%(17). The majority of expenditure is based on reimbursement, and the errors in this area mainly reflect the different categories of ineligible costs (mainly personnel costs, other direct costs and indirect costs).
1.24. ‘Cohesion' (Chapter 6: The estimated error rate is 5.7%, higher than the corresponding results for 2013 (5.3% (17)).
Almost all expenditure in this area takes the form of reimbursement.
The main causes of error include serious breaches of procurement rules (around half of the estimated error rate), followed by ineligible costs in declarations of expenditure (more than a quarter of the estimated error rate).
Infringements of State aid rules and ineligible projects constitute the remaining part of the errors.
1.25. ‘Natural resources' (Chapter 7): The estimated error rate is 3.6%, which is lower than the corresponding results for 2013 (4.4 % (17).
The European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) accounts for more than three quarters of expenditure in this area, and this fund is less prone to error than the rural development sub-sector, for which we have for a long time found high error rates, particularly for expenditure on the basis of reimbursement.
Overall, farmers' excessive area or number of animals contributed about one third of the estimated error rate.
Errors related to non-eligible beneficiaries, activities or expenditure accounted for the second highest proportion (around a quarter of the estimated error rate).
The main remaining shares are cross compliance infringements (one-sixth) and administrative errors (one-sixth).
1.23.
See the Commission's replies to Chapter 5 of the Annual Report (points 5.6-5.17).
1.24.
See the Commission's replies to Chapter 6 of the Annual Report (paragraphs 6.23-6.45 and 6.76).
1.25.
The lower error rate for the EAGF reflects the effectiveness of InVeKoS, and in particular LPIS, when properly implemented, as regards the prevention of errors from the first moment of the process.
The Commission considers that, overall, InVeKoS is a sound system for managing CAP expenditure.
See also the replies in points 1.15 and 1.20, points 7.15 to 7.19 and points 7.25 to 7.29.
(17) This comparative figure takes into account both the reclassification of budget lines to ensure that the chapters reflect the MFF headings and the new approach to non-compliance with procurement rules.
See also Figure 1.3).
THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE COURT 1.26. ‘Europe in the world' (Chapter 8): The estimated error rate is 2.7%, thus exceeding the corresponding results for 2013 (2.1%(18)(19).
Ineligible costs reimbursed by the Commission represent more than half of the total error rate.
Payments for non-performance of works and services or non-delivery account for a quarter of the total error rate.
The rest is due to lack of evidence (about one-tenth of the estimated error rate), incorrect calculation of expenditure and non-compliance with procurement rules.
1.27. "Administration" (Chapter 9): The estimated error rate is 0.5%, which is a decrease compared to the corresponding results for 2013 (1.1%(18).
Most expenditure in this area relates to salaries, pensions and allowances paid by EU institutions and bodies.
A small number of errors in the allowances accounted for the largest proportion of the error rate in this area, which is not essential overall.
1.28.
As explained in the general introduction, we do not draw up a separate chapter for expenditure not covered by the MFF headings 1, 2, 4 and 5.
The remaining EUR 2.1 billion (1.5 % of the expenditure covered by our audit) is therefore reported in this chapter (20).
Of the EUR 2.1 billion in total, EUR 0.5 billion is spent on expenditure through and by ten agencies, which are the subject of our special annual reports(21).
The main errors identified in this area were the reimbursement of ineligible costs (see Box 1.1).
(18) This comparative figure takes into account both the reclassification of budget lines to ensure that the chapters reflect the MFF headings and the new approach to non-compliance with procurement rules.
(19) Most of the expenditure in the chapter "External relations, external assistance and enlargement" of the 2013 annual report remained in the corresponding chapter for the MFF heading "Europe in the world". A small proportion of this expenditure is now covered in the chapter "Economic, social and territorial cohesion". See also Figure 1.3.

C 373/28 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES Box 1.1 — Example of errors in the reimbursement of costs for a project under the MFF heading 3 "Security and Citizenship" The subject of our sample was a payment by the Commission to a beneficiary who was the coordinator of a cooperation project under the "Fundamental Rights and Citizenship" programme.
The beneficiary public body assigned two permanent staff (officials) half-day to the project and charged part of its salaries in the project cost statement.
Deputies only cause additional costs where further staff have to be recruited in order to replace officials in their usual duties, and therefore actually incur costs.
As the beneficiary institution has not made provision for the replacement of officials, these costs are not eligible.
In total, the ineligible costs reported by the beneficiary entity amounted to EUR 58 000 of the total cost invoiced in the amount of EUR 237 000.
We identified ineligible costs for eight of the 25 projects covered by the sample for the MFF heading 3, which were reimbursed by the Commission.
Box 1.1 — Examples of errors in the reimbursement of costs for a project under the MFF heading 3 "Security and citizenship of the Union" The Commission has been aware of the difficulties encountered by public bodies in complying with the eligibility rules applicable to staff costs for public bodies (which hire other personnel to replace the official staff in their normal activities).
For this reason, the Commission amended from 2011 the eligibility rules applicable to staff of public bodies, taking advantage of the flexibility provided for in the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation.
Therefore, the non-eligible costs identified by the Court in the grant mentioned above (staff costs for staff in public bodies that do not allocate a replacement) would now be considered eligible.
1.29.
The estimated error rate for total shared management expenditure is 4.6% (2013: 4.9%(22)) and for all other operational expenditure(23) 4.6% (2013: 3.7%(22).
The estimated administrative expenditure error rate is 0,5 % (2013: 1,0 % (22) ).
(22) This comparative figure takes into account the new approach to non-compliance with procurement rules.
See also points 1.13 and 1.14.
(23) These expenditures are mainly covered by Chapters 7 and 8, but in part they are also those covered by Chapters 5 and 6.
The extrapolated error rate for shared management expenditure is based on the study of 687 transactions (from a population of EUR 113 billion).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/29 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES There are many forms of corrective action with different effects 1.30.
Our study of "errors and corrections" aims to shed light on the complex mechanisms for implementing and recording corrective measures and to explain the various ways in which these mechanisms can guide our audit work.
In some areas of expenditure, new instruments will be available to the Commission when expenditure is incurred for the new programming period.
Corrective measures 1.31.
We seek to take account of corrective measures taken by the Member States and the Commission in advance of payment or our investigation.
We also note corrections that take place after our audit announcement. However, we cannot reduce the estimated error rate whenever the audit itself triggers the corrective action (24).
We review the application of these corrections (including recoveries from beneficiaries and corrections at project level) and, where appropriate, adjust the calculation of the error rate.
However, the impact of the corrective measures varies considerably depending on the expenditure area and on the corrective action.
1.32.
The Commission and the authorities of the Member States had applied corrective measures for 24 of the operations assessed in a sample in 2014, which had a direct impact on the operation concerned and were relevant to our calculations.
These corrective measures resulted in a reduction of our estimated error rate by 1.1 percentage points (2013: 1.6 percentage points), which is approximately EUR 1.6 billion.
Changes in the number of operations concerned and the impact on our estimated error rate are not an indication that the corrective measures are more or less effective: since these measures apply to a relatively small proportion of our sample, fluctuations are expected from year to year.
1.30.
The Commission considers that the Court's annual representative error rate should be considered in the context of the Commission's corrective capacity in the various annual activity reports and the synthesis report.
The Financial Regulation requires appropriate consideration of the risks related to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multi-annual nature of the control systems and the nature of the payments.
1.31.
Joint response to paragraphs 1.31 and 1.32: In the 2014 synthesis report (COM(2015) 279 final), the Commission estimated the future impact of correction mechanisms to be EUR 2.7 billion, representing 1.9% of payments from the EU budget.
For a breakdown of the figures by policy area, see Table 1 in the synthesis report.
The Commission underlines that all types of financial corrections and recoveries exclude illegitimate expenditure from the reimbursement from the EU budget (see explanatory note 6 on the financial statements).
(24) See points 1.19-1.37 of the Annual Report for the financial year 2012.
The Commission uses the terms "financial corrections" and "recoveries" to cover a wide range of corrective measures that are applied both before and after the Commission's action (or reimbursement) of expenditure.
1.34.
Note 6.2.2 to the financial statements shows a total amount of EUR 3285 million for corrective actions in 2014.
Figure 1.7 shows how we classify the corrections made at the various stages of the expenditure cycle.
A quarter of all corrective measures in 2014 consist of corrections and recoveries ‘taken at the source', i.e. before the Commission carried out the related payment (25).
A further quarter will take the form of withdrawals and the replacement of expenditure on cohesion projects (either during implementation or at the conclusion of operational programmes). 1.33.
The Commission considers that the terms ‘financial corrections' and ‘recoveries' are used in accordance with the legal framework laid down in the Financial Regulation and the relevant sectoral legislation.
Further detailed information on the various preventive and corrective mechanisms provided for in the applicable legislation is provided in note 6 on the EU's annual accounts and in the Communication on the protection of the EU budget.
(25) For the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, the corrections reported in 2014 are ‘source EUR 430 million, 75% of which had already been made in previous years.

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.35.
The corrective measures discussed in this section of the annual report shall also include the work of the Member States' authorities and the recovery operations carried out by the national authorities and the Commission.
C 373/32 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 10.11.2015 DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES The impact of corrective measures is, to a large extent, tangible at the time when the Commission accepts expenditure 1.36.
All relevant sectoral regulations in the area of shared management contain rules on the primary controls to be carried out by national authorities or reductions in the amounts claimed by the final beneficiaries before the expenditure is certified.
In some cases, national authorities also agree to reduce or cancel certain costs which are constantly included in the declarations due to errors with long-term implications (such as ongoing payments under a contract where there is an error in the procurement rules).
Such adjustments may have a measurable impact on the amount of refund requested for individual projects or on the aid paid to individual farmers, and the correction will then help to reduce our estimated error rate.
1.37.
In the field of direct and indirect management, the ‘recoveries' covered by the Commission include the deduction of ineligible amounts for cost applications before the payment is authorised.
The eligibility of the amounts shall be established on the basis of the examination of the file of the available documents or on the basis of the results of the checks carried out (see also Figure 1.7).
This also allows us to reduce our estimated error rate.
Conformity decisions ("financial corrections" in the agricultural field) are often made on a flat-rate basis.
In general, they relate to system deficiencies rather than to errors at the level of the final beneficiaries.
In the rarest cases, they result in recovery of the farmers concerned.
Such corrective measures are an incentive for Member States to improve their management and control systems.
They contribute to the legality and regularity of operations at the level of the final beneficiaries if they lead to constant improvements in the cost statements accepted by the paying agencies (see boxes 1.2 and 1.3).
The Commission services also carry out recoveries ‘at source' by deducting ineligible expenditure (as determined in previous or current cost statements) from payments made.
1.38.
Financial corrections made by the Commission for agricultural expenditure are intended to protect the EU budget and are imposed on the Member States.
They do not directly result in the recovery of farmers, since the Commission does not pay the final beneficiaries directly, but reimburses the payments made by the Member States to farmers.
However, if these irregular payments are identifiable as a result of the conformity clearance procedure, the Commission would expect Member States to pursue them by means of recovery measures against the beneficiaries.
See answer to Box 1.3.
Payers implement conformity decisions by reducing future applications for reimbursement by the Commission for payments to farmers.
The Commission shall record the full amount paid out to farmers as expenditure, i.e. the adjustment shall not entail a reduction in the amount of the payments recorded.
Instead, the difference between payments to farmers and refunds to paying agencies is recorded as assigned revenue available to finance agricultural expenditure (26).
More than two-thirds of the "financial corrections" covered in the cohesion area in 2014 consist in replacing new expenditure,...
1.40.
In the cohesion field, "financial corrections" account for more than two-thirds of the total amount covered in cases where the authorities in the Member States withdraw expenditure declared and replace it with new expenditure.
In some cases, "reductions" do not identify any concrete projects as being withdrawn.
Instead, Member States report additional projects and thus receive a de facto lower co-financing rate.
1.40. The Commission considers that any financial corrections, including those allowing Member States to contribute new projects and new expenditure to reuse the corrected amounts, protect the EU budget against unlawful expenditure and encourage Member States to recover from beneficiaries (and thus contribute to improving management and control systems).
Nevertheless, the deterrent effect of net financial corrections, in which Member States cannot reuse the corrected and recovered amounts and thus lose funds, is certainly higher.
(26) For example, if an agricultural paying agency is subject to a 5% financial correction and makes payments of EUR 100 million to farmers, the Commission will reimburse it EUR 95 million, but the Commission, for its part, will record expenditure of EUR 100 million, which will be offset by assigned revenue of EUR 5 million.
C 373/34 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION OF THE COMMENTS OF THE HOFES... while net corrections are less frequent 1.41.
If a replacement is not possible, the corrections for the Member State concerned will result in a loss of EU funds(27), which, although relatively rare, may occur if Member States are unable to provide sufficient eligible expenditure and if a replacement is no longer possible (28) or allowed (29).
The Commission anticipates that, as a result of amendments to the legislation, net corrections will be more widely applied in the future. 1.41.
Following the example of agriculture, the legislator has decided to apply a similar mechanism of net financial corrections for the 2014-2020 programming period to cohesion policy.
This will give Member States an additional incentive to prevent or detect and remedy serious deficiencies in the management and control systems before the financial statements are sent to the Commission.
Otherwise, and if serious deficiencies continue to be identified by the Commission or the Court following the transmission of the financial statements, the Commission must make net financial corrections under the conditions laid down in the relevant regulations, which means that the funds are lost for the Member State.
The Commission also considers that, under shared management, all financial corrections and recoveries have a negative impact on national budgets, irrespective of the method of implementation.
In order to avoid a loss of EU funding, the Member State must replace non-eligible expenditure with additional eligible operations.
This means that the Member State with its national budget must bear the financial consequences of the loss of EU co-financing of expenditure deemed to be ineligible, unless it recovers the amounts from each beneficiary.
(27) Either as a reduction in payments or as a return to the EU budget leading to assigned revenue (see Figure 2.2).
(28) After completion of the programmes.
(29) In the event of disagreement between Member States and the Commission (see point 1.25(b) of the 2012 annual report).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION C 373/35 THE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES In 2014, the Commission and Member States applied all these forms of corrective measures 1.42.
Box 1.2-1.4 illustrates different types and effects of corrective measures. Box 1.2 — Example of improvement of management and control systems — Greece: adjustment of the land identification system The Commission has taken measures to ensure the improvement of the system for identifying agricultural parcels (LPIS) which serves as a basis for payments to agricultural holdings, such as the single payment scheme (the largest single EU expenditure scheme).
This process took place at different stages and resulted in the ‘Eligible permanent pasture' covered by the Greek LPIS, falling from 3.6 million hectares in 2012 to 1.5 million hectares in October 2014.
Non-legislative applications for ‘permanent grassland', which is not eligible for EU aid, has been a key factor in our estimated error rate for ‘natural resources' for several years.
We took into account the impact of corrections in respect of individual payments made to final beneficiaries, which were the subject of our sample of operations carried out by the EAGF and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Another effect is that the paying agency rejected many non-eligible applications, which resulted in the corresponding expenditure falling out of our sample.
Box 1.2 — Example of improvement of management and control systems — Greece: cleaning up the area identification system Other examples of the positive impact of action plans are given by the Court in Chapter 7.
Action plans are implemented whenever deemed necessary and the Commission monitors their implementation with great care and reports on the corrective actions taken in the annual activity report of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development.
The area identification system shall prevent beneficiaries from claiming claims for non-existent land or not meeting the eligibility criteria, or for land for which claims have already been made by another beneficiary.
If properly implemented, it is a very effective tool to reduce the error rate.
It covers 75% of CAP expenditure.
The 2014 Annual Activity Report of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development shows that the error rates for area-related payments are lower than for other measures.
C 373/36 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 10.11.2015 DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES Box 1.3 — Example of corrections resulting from conformity clearance procedures (30) — Conformity Decision 47 and its consequences for French farmers In 2014, France accepted an adjustment of EUR 1.1 billion (984 million for the EAGF and EUR 94 million for the EAFRD)(31).
The national authorities stated that this would have no consequences for farmers and the amount would be disputed from the national budget.
In previous annual reports, we pointed out that such an approach does not encourage beneficiaries to correct errors (32).
The main reasons for the correction were shortcomings in LPIS/GIS (695 million euros) and the exceedance of the ceiling for payment entitlements, resulting in excessive payments to farmers (141 million euros).
A further reason, albeit to a lesser extent, was violations of the cross compliance obligation of timely notification of movements of animals (123 million euros).
All of these reasons are related to payments made between 2009 and 2013.
No adjustment was made for 2014 and the non-compliance with the ceiling for payment entitlements and the non-eligible areas covered by the LPIS of France contributed 0.3 percentage points to our estimated error rate for ‘Natural resources' this year.
Box 1.3 — Example of corrections resulting from conformity clearance procedures — Conformity Decision 47 and its consequences for French farmers Under shared management, Member States are responsible for ensuring that the control systems function properly.
The EUR 1.1 billion financial correction will be repaid to the EU budget in three annual instalments (2015, 2016 and 2017).
The Commission would point out that the nature of the conformity clearance procedure, which applies ex-post, makes it very rare after the closure of the accounts of the year and after a counter-dictatory period in which the Member State concerned can present its own reasoning and calculation that a financial correction is already decided in the following year of the expenditure in question.
An ongoing conformity clearance procedure will protect the EU budget for 2014.
Box 1.4 — Example of corrections resulting in additional expenditure: ESF — Romania In our annual reports on financial years 2012 and 2013, we pointed out corrective measures in Romania.
In 2013, we were able to reduce our estimated error rate in relation to a number of Romanian projects of the European Social Fund (ESF), as the national authorities had identified the impact of the corrections at project level.
This was also the case in 2014.
Some of the projects we have examined continue to cause errors due to problems not covered by the corrections.
In its Annual Activity Report for 2014, the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) pointed out that it continued to follow the implementation of the agreed action plan.
The financial corrections made do not necessarily mean that Romania will receive less EU funds, as Member States can make use of the possibility of making use of a larger amount of expenditure (33).
(30) A multi-year procedure allowing recovery of amounts paid to Member States where these payments are in breach of EU rules or where there are deficiencies in the Member State's management and control systems.
See also point 7.59.
(31) France subsequently appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union against the decision to impose the financial correction.
(32) See points 1.26 and 1.32 of the 2012 Annual Report.
(33) This would in practice be equivalent to a reduction in the EU co-financing rate.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/37 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES In its reporting on corrective measures, the Commission does not always quantify the different effects of corrective action,...
1.43.
Explanatory note 6 to the annual accounts is largely a voluntary disclosure of information which is not necessary in accordance with the accounting rules.
A significant part of this information does not come from accounting systems.
The explanation provides a description of the different impact of the different corrective adjustments on the EU budget, but not always in quantified form.... and further improvements would allow a better analysis 1.44.
The Commission's capacity to improve the quality of expenditure is linked not only to the amounts concerned, but also to their impact.
A rigorous assessment of the effects of corrective measures requires better information on the nature of the corrected error and the way in which corrections are made (34).
When assessing the impact of their corrective action, the relevant Commission Directorates-General shall make the necessary adjustments to the figures set out in Note 6 (see point 1.55).
The Commission's synthesis report confirms major errors in operations 1.45.
Each Directorate-General of the Commission shall draw up an annual activity report.
This report shall include — a report on the achievement of the main policy objectives (referred to in Chapter 3), — a management report from the Director-General to the College of Commissioners, and — a statement by the Director-General to ensure that the financial information contained in the report is properly presented and that the transactions falling within his/her area of responsibility are lawful and proper.
1.43.
The legislator has provided the Commission with the instrument of financial corrections to ensure that unlawful expenditure is not financed from the EU budget.
These financial corrections relate mainly to system deficiencies that lead to a risk of error.
It is the responsibility of the Member States and not of the Commission to identify improper amounts and recover them from the beneficiaries.
If this does not happen, EU funds will be replaced by national funds, as national budgets will have to bear the burden of financial corrections.
1.44.
Several services have duly adjusted their figures for the protection of the EU budget set out in explanatory note 6 in order to provide an estimate of future corrections in relation to their specific circumstances.
(34) See points 1.13-1.15 of the 2013 Annual Report.
C 373/38 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 DE COMMENTS FROM THE HOFES 1.46. The synthesis report contains a summary of this information and a statement that, with the adoption of the synthesis report, the Commission assumes overall political responsibility for the management of the EU budget.
1.47.
This section of the chapter contains the results of our analysis of the annual activity reports of the Directorates-General and of the Commission's synthesis report(35).
The focus is on the consistency and appropriateness of the Commission's estimates in relation to — the error rate at the time of the Commission's reimbursement or payment of own expenditure (the Commission refers here to 'risk amount'), — the extent to which errors are rectified by subsequent corrections (the Commission refers here to its 'correction capacity' or 'estimated future corrections' (36)).
The Directors-General shall report annually on the regularity of 1.48.
If the Directors-General are not able to guarantee reliability for a significant part of expenditure, they will make a reservation (see Box 1.5).
The directors-general should proceed in such a way that — an event which has a serious impact on the reputation of the Commission, or — the impact of the estimated error rates, less financial corrections already made and recoveries, is still essential.

10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/39 DE HOFES COMMENTS Box 1.5 — Reservations in Annual Activity Reports 2014 In 2014, the Directors-General made a total of 20 quantified reservations as compared to 17 in 2013.
The increase in the total number of reservations is due to three new reservations from the Directors-General of the Directorates-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) (37) and Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR)(38)(39) and the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) (40); — the division of a recurring reservation into two reservations (41); — the abolition of a reservation (42).
In 2014, the expenditure figure with a reservation decreased from 2.4 billion euros in 2013 to 2.3 billion euros in 2014 (43).
1.49.
The European Parliament resolution on the 2013 discharge(44) calls on the Commission ‘to further clarify the calculation of the risk amount by explaining the estimated impact of correction mechanisms on that figure'.
(37) Reservation concerning the Information and Communication Technology Policy Support Programme (ICT) of the countries participating in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), as the residual error rate exceeds 2% (2.94%).
(38) reservation regarding indirect management by the beneficiary countries, as the residual error rate is above 2 % (2,67 %).
(39) The problems identified in the 2013 annual report gave rise to a new reservation on reputational grounds by DG NEAR (formerly DG ELARG), see paragraph 7.16 of the 2013 annual report).
(40) Reservation on expenditure under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), as the residual error rate exceeds 2% (2.13%).
(41) The Directorate-General for Regional Policy and Urban Development (DG REGIO) divided its recurring reservation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)/Cohesion Fund (CF)/ Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) into two reservations, one on the ERDF/CF and the other on the IPA.
(42) The Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) has lifted its reservation regarding the programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases in the food and feed policy area.
(43) See synthesis report, Annex 2.
(44) Report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013, Section III — Commission and executive agencies 2014/2075 (DEC) (A8-001/2015).
THE COMMENTS OF THE COURT 1.50.
In accordance with the request from the discharge authority, the Commission further developed its internal guidance (45) on the presentation of information in Annual Activity Reports in 2014.
The Directors-General are now to present an "average detected error rate" (46).
The application of this error rate to the total payments of the year leads to the calculation of the ‘risk amount'(47).
The synthesis report identifies this amount together with the estimate of the future correction capacity of ex post controls carried out by the Commission. The Commission acknowledges that the expenditure is significantly affected by errors...
1.51.
In the 2014 synthesis report, the Commission identified the ‘risk amount' as a range of between EUR 3.7 billion and EUR 5 billion.
This represents between 2,6 % and 3,5 % of the payments for 2014(48) covered by the synthesis report.
These figures show that total expenditure is significantly affected by errors.... however, points to the estimated impact of future corrections 1.52.
The 2014 synthesis report provides an estimated total of estimated future corrections (correction capacity).
On the basis of the corrections recorded during the last six years(49), the Commission estimates that in the coming years it will be able to "identify and correct errors of around EUR 2700 million in total" (50).
(45) Standing Instructions for the 2014 Annual Activity Reports (SEC(2014) 553).
(46) This is the detected or estimated error rate at the time of payment (not the residual error rate), i.e. without adjustment due to subsequently corrected errors.
