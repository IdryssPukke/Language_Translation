The president's submission4 One of the main objectives of the Court and its tasks of transparency and accountability is to bring the European Court of Auditors closer to EU citizens.
I therefore very much welcome you as readers of the first annual report of the European Court of Auditors.
The aim of the report is to provide an overview of the Court's activities in 2007, in which it celebrates a 30-year term as an external auditor of the European Union, which, in accordance with its mission, contributes to the improvement of the financial management of the EU and is an independent guardian of the financial interests of Union citizens.
The Court shall make its main contribution to its audits and reports which enable the audit authority to improve its financial management and to assist the discharge authority (the European Parliament and the Council) in exercising control over the implementation of the EU budget.
This report reviews the audit reports published in 2007 and contains the main conclusions on the implementation of the EU budget for 2006 and on the sound financial management of the EU.
The Court not only informs about financial management over recent years but also actively participates in the creation of an EU financial control framework.
2007 was very important for EU financial management.
In the Court's opinion on important changes in the responsibility of the Member States and the Court's contribution to the public consultation on budgetary reform launched by the European Commission.
None of the Court's 2007 results would have been possible without the involvement, expertise and competence of 850 employees.
Staff is the main capital of a future-oriented body that is committed to continuous improvement.
This first annual activity report contains detailed information on the Court's reform process, which started in 2006 as a result of self-assessment.
Progress was made in 2007 in implementing the Action Plan, which was set up and, at the end of 2007, the so-called peer review procedure was launched under the direction of a group of auditors belonging to the national accounting tribunals in Canada, Austria, Norway and Portugal.
The first outcome of this reform process was the following declaration on the mandate, design, values and strategic objectives of the Court, on the basis of which the Court will report on future actions in due time.
I wish you a great deal of joy in reading the first annual activity report and I hope it will be of benefit to you.

8 THE THE COURT'S ROLE AND WORK WHAT'S THE COURT'S ROLE?
The budget of the European Union is around EUR 120 billion, representing around 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of the 27 Member States.
Compared to national budgets, this is a small percentage.
However, for some Member States, EU measures play an important role in financing public actions, roughly corresponding to the GNI of some countries, such as Romania.
Over time, budget dynamics have changed and agricultural and cohesion policy are the main areas of expenditure (see Box 1).
The budget shall be adopted annually by the Council on the basis of the seven-year financial framework, i.e. representatives of the Member States, and by the European Parliament directly elected on a proposal from the European Commission.
The Commission is implementing the budget itself, but it is sharing a large part of the administrative tasks with the Member States, in particular with regard to agricultural and cohesion policy expenditure.
Depending on the expenditure system, national authorities may be responsible for defining the expenditure strategy, selecting beneficiaries and projects, as well as for the implementation of payments.
A particular feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments on the basis of applications of the beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers throughout the Union.
9 BOX 1, HOW DOES THE EU EXPECT HIS HIS HIS HIS HIS HISSELF HISSELF?
The EU budget serves to a large extent different objectives than national budgets, partly due to differences in competences.
For example, the Union is not responsible for social security systems, which are usually the majority of national expenditure.
Since the 1960s, agricultural expenditure, which usually takes the form of payments to farmers across the Union, has been the main contribution to budget expenditure, although it is now showing a downward trend.
In 2008, a slightly less than half of the budget for the conservation and management of natural resources, mainly for agriculture and rural development, was foreseen.
Since the 1980s, a significant proportion of expenditure has come from the area of cohesion.... regional and social development.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... and..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sustainable growth expenditure in 2008, including the lion's share of cohesion, was estimated at 38% of the budget.
This heading also covers a significant part of the EU's research budget.
About 6% of the budget is spent on the management of the Community institutions.

Democratic society needs complete and reliable public information as a basis for discussion and decision-making, both in order to improve financial management and to ensure accountability.
The European Court of Auditors acts as an external EU auditor, ensuring that EU funds, wherever they are used, are correctly booked and spent in accordance with the rules, taking due account of the optimal spending of funds.
The Court's audit work is used by the Commission, Parliament and Council, as well as by the Member States, to improve the EU's financial management.
In addition to the Court's activities, many national audit authorities examine EU funds, provided that they are managed and spent by public authorities in the Member States.

The annual statement of assurance is commonly known under the acronym DAS (including Déclaration d.Assurance).
1 For more information on the Court's audit methods, see the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
The Court carries out an audit of the EU's annual accounts in accordance with the International Audit Principles (ISA), which apply both in the public and private sectors.
The Court is actively involved in the development of international audit standards in cooperation with the national audit bodies, which promote standardisation bodies (Intosai, IFAC) 2.
In order to ensure compliance of payments with the rules and legal framework, the Court is based on the results of both the examination of supervisory and control systems to prevent and detect and correct errors of legality and regularity and the sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Where systems are checked and considered reliable, the number of operations which the Court needs to examine in order to obtain reliable conclusions on their legality and regularity shall be reduced accordingly.
With regard to the selection of topics for performance control, the Court is seeking to identify the areas of control for which it can be expected that they will be the most likely to improve the expected savings, efficiency and effectiveness of EU spending.

13 BOX 2 BOX 2 BOX 2 PRELIMINARY COURT CONTROLS WITH REGARD TO THE PAYMENT OF THE EU BUDGET The Court does not have the resources necessary for the detailed examination of all operations of the EU budget.
The Court follows these actions up to the final recipient of the aid, such as the farmer in southern Germany.
The Court then carries out on-the-spot checks, for example, to verify whether the data contained in the proposal is in line with the reality.
Population of all agricultural payments By applying a statistical sample, the results can be summarised for the population, i.e. for a specific area of income or expenditure, and can be used as a basis for a general assessment, together with the information resulting from the evaluation of the system.
This chart shows how the Court works to determine transactions for the purpose of carrying out a detailed audit.
In practice, the Court's random checks are more complex, for example on the basis of two-step sampling, in order to improve the effectiveness of the checks.

The organisational review (see page 17) shows that there are four thematic control groups that cover different budgetary areas (protection and management of natural resources, structural policy, transport, research and energy, external policy, own resources, banking activities, administrative expenditure, Community institutions and bodies and internal policy).
The Fifth Audit Group (CEAD or coordination, communication, evaluation, quality assurance and development) is responsible for horizontal issues such as coordination in the field of assurance, quality assurance, development of the audit methodology of the Court and the general dissemination of the Court's audit results and reports.
In addition, a management committee composed of members of all audit groups shall be responsible for preparing all administrative matters requiring a formal decision of the Court.
MEMBERS of the Court shall be appointed by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, for a six-year term, as proposed by each Member State.
In addition to the functions within the college, which is responsible for final decisions on audits and opinions, as well as on further strategic and administrative issues, each member shall be responsible for its specific tasks mainly in the field of audit.
The member shall then adopt the report in the audit group or in the Court, and after its adoption in the European Parliament, in the Council and in front of other interested parties.
On 1 January 2007, together with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Court welcomed two new members, Nadešda Sandolova and Ovidiu Ipir.
A year later, on 1 January 2008, the Court adopted three new members: Michel Cretin (France), Henri Grethena (Luxembourg) and Harald Noack (Germany), as the terms of office of the predecessors expired.
In addition, the Council extended the term of office of four members (Greece, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom) for another six years.

18 SUMMARY OF THE AUDIT REPORTS AND 3 THE COURT'S COMMENTS The results of the Court's audits of accounting and compliance audits are in most cases included in the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund (EDF) and in the specific annual reports on Union agencies and bodies.
Performance control results shall be published during the year in the form of special reports.
The Court shall also publish opinions on draft legislation affecting financial management.
ANNUAL REPORT 2006 ANNUAL REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET As the Court has repeatedly stated in its annual reports on the implementation of the EU general budget, the relevant and relevant internal control systems established by the Commission and the Member States are of key importance for ensuring sound financial management of the EU.
In recent years, the Court has recognised the Commission's efforts to promote and apply improved internal control and management procedures both with regard to the reliability of the EU's annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the operations set out therein.
The 2006 Annual Report continued this tradition by identifying areas where there is a significant need for improvement in some cases, as well as areas where the situation is still unsatisfactory.
The Court found that the final accounts of the European Communities, which contained a report on the implementation of the EU budget for 2006, contained, in all material respects, a true and fair view of the financial situation and the results of the Communities, except in the event of excessive amounts of commitments and advance payments on the balance sheet.
It is therefore considered necessary that further improvements are needed to ensure that the newly introduced accrual accounting is fully satisfactory and that its potential as a reliable management and control tool is fully exploited.
3 This section aims at introducing, not a summary of, the Court's reports and opinions.
Further information can be found in the full text of the Court's documents published on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) after their adoption.
With regard to the expenditure areas covered by the final accounts of the European Communities in respect of expenditure areas in which the majority of payments originate from agriculture [mainly agricultural expenditure not covered by the Integrated Management and Control System (IACS), structural measures, internal policies and many external policies in respect of agriculture, the Court gives a negative opinion on the legality and regularity of agricultural expenditure and concludes that there are still significant errors in these expenditure areas.
In the case of payments in these areas, the supervisory and control systems have only partially reduced the risk of errors in the legality and regularity of transactions.
The Court stresses that complex or unclear eligibility criteria or complex legislation had a significant impact on the legality and regularity of the transactions.
However, the Court noted a significant decrease in the estimated overall level of errors in the agricultural transactions and concluded that the HACCP is an effective system, if properly applied, in order to reduce the risk of irregular expenditure.
In addition, the Court found that the underlying transactions did not show significant errors, including payments related to administrative expenditure, a major part of the pre-accession strategy and part of the external policy (see Box 3). 19
20 BOX 3 WEEKLY REVIEW OF JUSTICE AND RULES OF PROCEDURE OF EXISTING WEEKS BY EXPENDITURE The table summarises the overall assessment of supervisory and control systems in accordance with the relevant chapters of the 2006 Annual Report and presents an overall review of the results of the Court's audits in respect of representative samples of transactions.
These systems are considered to be partially satisfactory if certain control systems are considered to be functioning properly and others are functioning and others are not.
As a result, they may not, in general, be able to limit errors in underlying transactions to an acceptable level.
The report draws attention to some shortcomings in the functioning of supervisory and control systems in and in the field of h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (EFF) In 2007, the Court also published an annual report on the European Development Fund (EFF).
While the Court was able to issue an opinion on the reliability of the EDF accounts, the opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions of payments approved by delegations in the beneficiary countries was limited in view of the significant level of error in those transactions.
OTHER ANNUAL REPORT In addition, a further 28 special annual reports on European agencies and other decentralised bodies and an annual report on the assessment of the effectiveness of the management of the European Central Bank were published in 2007.
SPECIAL REPORTS REPORTED IN 2007 IN 2007 The Court published a total of nine special reports.
The reports dealt with research on financial management issues in many different fields, ranging from cooperation in the field of VAT (No 8/2007) to capacity building in distant countries such as Angola and Vietnam (No 6/2007).
The Court's audit revealed various types of problems with different consequences.
The weaknesses identified by the Court in relation to the expenditure of the EU institutions on buildings (No 2/2007) indicate that not all EU funds have been used in this area.
The shortcomings identified in the report on monitoring, inspection and sanctioning systems with regard to the rules for the conservation of Community fish stocks (No 7/2007) can have serious consequences not only for water resources but also for the future of the fisheries sector.
Regardless of the different uses of resources in the different areas of the EU budget, the Court's reports point to a number of common topics which can be discussed as follows: 22 • • • Although the use of resources should be both rapid and effective, stress may arise in the pursuit of these two objectives.
This topic is the subject of the report on the mid-term processes of the Structural Funds (No 1/2007) and the Commission report on the management of the CARDS programme in the Western Balkan countries (No 5/2007).
Although planning does not guarantee effectiveness, it is important.
The strategic and long-term planning issues were addressed in the reports on the expenditure of the EU institutions on buildings (No 2/2007) and the evaluation of the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (RTD) (No 9/2007) and in the two external assistance reports, one on CARDS (No 5/2007) and the other on the effectiveness of technical assistance in capacity building (No 6/2007).
The Commission's assessments are a key element of their performance management system for assessing performance and, if necessary, assessing performance improvement needs.
Where the evaluation takes place at an early stage of the programming cycle, this means that progress is insufficient and insufficient data is available for the evaluation.
On the other hand, where evaluations are carried out at a later date, it may be possible to reduce the possibility of making changes in the current period of time and improvements before the next one begins.
The issue of the proper timing of the evaluations was addressed both in the report on the mid-term processes of the Structural Funds (No 1/2007) and in the report on the evaluation of RTD (No 9/2007).
23 • • Evaluation, like audits, is more difficult to carry out when the objectives of the expenditure programmes are unclear, which was the next topic of the last two reports.
The management and control of EU expenditure are subject to complex rules, which must be clearly and unambiguously formulated to ensure that they are used for their intended purposes.
The existence of clear definitions and rules is crucial for the collection or use of funds as planned.
This topic was addressed in the reports on the European Refugee Fund (No 2007/2007) and on the control of goods and substitutions carried out by Member States in respect of exports of agricultural products (No 4/2007).
The lack of common definitions is one of the factors that may affect the completeness, comparability and reliability of data from different Member States.
This may have consequences if the data are the basis for a decision, for example on the allocation of funds.
24 Special Report No 1/2007 Special Report No 2/2007 Special Report No 4/2007 Special Report No 5/2007 Special Report No 6/2007 Special Report No 8/2007 Special Report No 9/2007 Special Report No 9/2007 The implementation of the mid-term processes of the Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006 Expenditure of the institutions on buildings The management of the European Refugee Fund (2000-2004) The control of goods and substitutions for the export of products to be reimbursed The management of the CARDS programme by the Commission The effectiveness of technical assistance in capacity building within the framework of the monitoring, inspection and sanctioning systems for the protection of Community fisheries resources Administrative cooperation of the institutions in the field of value added tax Evaluation of the Union framework programmes for research and technological development in the field of research and technological development in the field of evaluation, could the Commission improve its approach?
OPINIONS PUBLISHED In 2007, the Court also contributes to improving the EU's financial management by issuing opinions on proposals or issues relating to financial management.
These opinions are required as part of the procedure for the adoption of financial rules 4 or may be issued at the request of one of the other institutions of the Community 5. In addition, the Court may issue opinions on its own initiative.
The Court's opinions may concern certain areas of expenditure, such as the two 2007 opinions, which concern the new regulations of the European Development Fund (Nos 2/2007 and 9/2007).
They may also cover broader issues related to EU financial management, such as the Court's opinion on the annual summaries, national declarations and the audit work of the national audit authorities (No 6/2007).
Opinions are based on the Court's expertise over the years in the audit of EU financial management and in some cases relate to certain audits.
For example, in its opinion on ensuring the correct application of customs and agricultural legislation (No 3/2007), the Court refers to the recommendation in the previous special report that the Commission should take action to improve the reliability of sources of information on fraud.
The need for simplification is a matter repeated in the Court's opinions (see, for example, Opinion No 7/2007 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities).
In its 2007 opinion (No 6/2007), the Court presented its position on the annual summaries, as well as on the so-called national declarations, which some Member States voluntarily presented on their own initiative.
This opinion was discussed in detail in the section on the Court's position on the matter.
4 5 Article 279 of the Treaty.
Article 248 (4)
Most of the Court's opinions have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and are available on the Court's website.
26 IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPLEMENTATION Public control plays a key role in modern democratic societies in terms of effective financial management.
Control activities shall be transferred to addressees at the end of the information chain, in this case to European citizens, in order to determine whether their taxpayers' money is spent properly and properly.
In this way, public control is a key element of responsibility and a useful basis for public debate.
In this respect, the Court's work has considerable potential for impact.
The Court's audits serve decision-makers in the institutions concerned in the European context, in particular the Commission, the Parliament, the Council and the Member States, as a direct source of information.
On the basis of this information, they may take action, with or without reference to the conclusions of the checks.
Although the Court's audit activities have the greatest impact on its published reports, its impact already has some impact on the entire audit process.
In particular, all checks shall lead to the presentation of detailed checks to be submitted to the audited entity in order to confirm the accuracy of the Court's observations.
The final text of the report shall also be subject to the procedure of the adversarial procedure to ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that we ensure that the final text of the report is subject to the procedure of the adversarial procedure.
The replies of the audited entity, in particular the Commission, shall be published together with the reports.
In its replies, the audited entity often takes into account the problems identified by the Court and sets out the steps it intends to take to resolve them.
Following the audit work and the publication of the report, the audit results shall be assessed and used by Parliament and the Council to carry out their policy tasks to monitor the use of budgetary resources.
In the framework of the Court's annual discharge procedure, the Court's reports form the basis for the Council's recommendation and Parliament's decision.
The 2006 discharge procedure drew particular attention to the Court's conclusions on structural policy.
In its resolution on discharge for 2006, Parliament refers directly to the action plan proposed by the Commission directly following the conclusions of the Court's annual report and asks for quarterly reports on its implementation.
Parliament also calls for better insight into the corrective measures taken to remedy errors and errors.
Special reports shall also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
However, as they are published during the year, the presentation of special reports and the debate on this issue were usually held at Parliament and Council meetings at an earlier stage.
A good example of possible follow-up is the recent special report on building expenditure (No 2/2007).
Parliament has already entrusted its Management Board with the preparation of a report in which it will examine whether it is possible to create a European Construction Office entrusted with the construction and maintenance of the buildings of the European Union institutions and bodies.
Another example is the Court's report on the checks carried out by the Member States on the export of agricultural products (No 4/2007).
The Council and the Commission responded promptly to the Court's recommendations by amending the existing rules.
The impact of audit reports can be increased by their involvement in relevant media, which will increase their attention and encourage public debate.
The media is the most direct source of information for citizens.
Overall, the media report for the Court's annual report is quite extensive, but the press has also followed some special reports with interest.
The report on fisheries (No 7/2007) has paid great attention to the media.
In order to discuss the Court's report, the Extraordinary Council for Fisheries was convened and the Commission launched a procedure which could lead to changes to the legislation in order to remedy the deficiencies identified.
This is an example of a report which, due to its actuality and its actuality, could make a very valuable contribution to the decision-making process.
This section provides some guidance on the impact of the Court's reports published in 2007.
For more information on the follow-up to the Court's earlier observations, see the relevant chapters of the Court's annual report.
The most frequently reported by the Court in its most recent annual report is that, despite the actions taken, the shortcomings identified in the previous year were only partially resolved.
The Court's opinions should also be taken into account when considering the impact of the Court's work.
The Court intends to examine more and more the long-term impact of its audit work and of its opinions in this area.
This can be illustrated by the example shown in Box 4.
27 BOX 4 BOX 4 BOX OF THE COURT'S FRAMEWORK ON THE TEACHING OF THE EU BUDGET ON FRAMEWORK 4 BOX 4 OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE COMMENTS OF THE COURT ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE EU BUDGET'S BUDGET'S BUDGET'S BUDGET'S BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS OF THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S COMMENTS ON THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE COURT'S COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE COURT'S BUDGET'S BUDGET'S BUDGET'S COMMENTS
The opinion on a single study (No 2/2004) in 2004 made it possible to make a significant contribution.
In this opinion, the Court proposes that the definition and transposition of the entire internal control be included in a single integrated control system, which includes common principles and principles and ensures that the costs and benefits are proportionate.
The opinion on the Single Audit in 2007 turned into a reference document for the Commission, but also for the Court, in its comments on the definition of effective and effective internal control in the updated rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation (opinion No 1/2007).
The integrated audit approach is reflected in the Commission Action Plan for the Integrated Internal Control Framework for 2006.
The Commission has taken steps to highlight the role and responsibilities of the Member States in internal control, including a new commitment to submit annual summaries of opinions, statements and audits carried out in accordance with the regulations applicable to each area of expenditure.
28 THE COURT'S OPINIONS NATIONAL SUMMARY AND DECLARATIONS The Commission and the Member States have taken initiatives to increase the involvement of Member States in the cycle of responsibility for EU measures.
The aim is to address partly the problem of significant errors in the legality and regularity of the main expenditure areas in the budget, in particular in areas where the Commission and the Member States share management.
Among the most significant recent changes are the obligation for Member States to submit annual summaries of available audit results and declarations, voluntary initiatives taken by certain Member States to submit national declarations and decisions by certain national control authorities on the preparation of audit reports on the management of EU funds.
In Opinion No 6/2007, the Court considers that all these elements, if properly implemented, can contribute to the improvement of the management and control of EU funds.
The opinion clarifies the conditions under which these elements may constitute added value and may be applied by the Court in accordance with international auditing standards.
Since annual summaries form part of the internal control system, the Court will assess, within the framework of its usual control procedures, to what extent they will improve the functioning of internal control.
Annual summaries may lead to improved overall control of EU funds in shared management areas to the extent that they reflect strengths and weaknesses.
National statements are based on voluntary initiatives taken by some Member States, taken at the highest level and presented to national Parliaments.
Although they do not in themselves constitute conclusive evidence, they can be seen as an innovative element of internal control and can provide valuable information on the implementation of the EU budget.
The Court recognises the potential benefits of the statements of national and national audit work with a view to raising awareness in the Member States of the importance of internal control of EU funds.
The audit work carried out by national audit authorities (national audit reports) with regard to the legality and regularity of EU expenditure or with regard to national declarations could provide the Court with audit evidence if the Court is able to ensure the relevance and quality of the audit work in accordance with international audit standards.
In such a case, the Court will take into account the notes issued by the national control authorities in the planning and conduct of its own controls.
National declarations and control reports shall contain declarations concerning control systems.
National declarations may also contain certain opinions on the legality and regularity of transactions.
Experience has shown that the main risk to the legality and regularity of transactions is the reliability of the information provided by the beneficiaries at the time of the application for EU funding and not the way in which the data is processed by the Member States and the Commission.
The declaration that systems operate in accordance with the requirements of the EU Regulation cannot in itself guarantee the legality and regularity of the transactions in question.
Recognising the need to strengthen the role of national control authorities in the overall context of the responsibility for EU expenditure, the Contact Committee of the EU Supreme Audit Authorities has set up a working group on the harmonisation of control standards and standards adapted to the EU context.
Common control methods and methods increase the Court's capacity to rely on the work of the national control authorities, provided that the quality of the work is directly demonstrated.
VERIFICATION OF the EU BUDGET In September 2007, the Commission published a consultative document to launch an open debate on EU funding in the framework of an extensive budget review.
At the beginning of April 2008, the Court presented its contribution to the debate in which it presented the main principles to be taken into account in the development of the new programmes in order to ensure European added value in order to ensure clarity of objectives, simplification, dealing with reality, transparency and accountability.

The Court monitors the implementation of the work programme as a basis for improvement in the coming years.
In 2007, there was a significant increase in the number of specific annual reports adopted on European agencies and other decentralised agencies.
The number of special reports and opinions was similar to that of previous years.
The annual reports on the general budget and the European Development Funds have been published as planned.
Results 2004 2005 2006 2007 Special reports 10 6 11 9 Annual reports (including EDFs) 1 1 Special Annual Reports 23 20 23 29 Opinions 2 11 8 9 In 2007 the Court first applied its new Assurance model (in order to obtain audit certainty) to obtain the most effective results.
The Court also decided to provide more detailed information on the results of its Statement of Assurance, in particular on the results of the audits of individual transactions.
The Court considers that, together with a schematic presentation of the results of the evaluation of the system, it provides useful information for monitoring purposes which measure progress in financial management.
The Court's action plan and procedures and the PEER-REVEV procedure are constantly seeking to improve all aspects of its work.
In 2005, the Court decided to undergo peer review.
To this end, senior staff of a small number of the highest audit authorities shall assess the organisation or performance of a sister institution on the basis of professional standards and professional experience.
Since all the highest audit bodies have similar tasks, peer review procedures can make a very valuable contribution to improving audit structures.
In 2006, in preparation for the peer review procedure, the Court carried out a self-assessment which enabled the institution to examine its strengths and weaknesses.
In 2007, the Court adopted an action plan to address the shortcomings identified.
The plan included a total of 23 actions, of which six concerned task forces involving members of the Court and staff from various fields and degrees of institution hierarchy: 31 1. The Action Plan, mission, strategic objectives and planning 2. Management structure (managing), structure and organisation 3. Internal performance indicators 4. Employees and communication 5. External stakeholders and communication activities, External communication strategy 6. Improving the quality of the reports The results of these task forces in 2007 included new declarations of mandate, plan and values, as well as strategic objectives for the Court, a new strategy and guidelines for internal communication and a report on how to improve the quality of the reports.
LEGALITY AND QUALITY OF CONTROL COOPERATION Many of the strategic objectives adopted concern institutions' products.
The Court seeks to increase the visibility of its audit by selecting the relevant subjects, bringing time to time, and making its reports clearer and clearer.
It also started to increase the number of performance controls and improve their quality.
In 2007, considerable efforts were made to further develop the methodological basis for the Court's work as a key condition for the quality of the audit work.
In 2008, a new manual on accounting control and compliance control was drawn up to be completed.
The new Economic Audit Manual of the Court was adopted at the end of 2006 and was adopted for the first time in 2007 as guidelines for auditors.
In order to further improve the quality of the Court's work on the audit of performance of tasks, additional guidelines have been developed and several seminars and trainings have been organised.
In addition, the Court has set new ambitious targets for the use of information technology.
In the new IT strategy adopted in 2007, the Court stated its intention to increase the capacity to carry out IT audits and to transform the use of Computer Assisted Audit Technics.CAATs into an accounting and audit practice.
It is important that the quantity and quality of the Court's product can be properly assessed.
The Court intends to develop performance indicators to enable it to provide various performance data in future annual activity reports.
In future, the Court plans to develop a methodology for assessing the cost-effectiveness of the institution32.
33 The Court's 30-year existence In 2007, the European Court of Auditors celebrated its 30-year existence as an external audit body of the European Union.
The celebrations began with a greater presence of the Court (seminars, information, etc.) in most of the European Union's capitals in the framework of the 2007 European Day.
On 17 October 2007 an exhibition was also opened under the motto...30 years of the Court of Auditors... containing many thematic charts, sound images with more than 150 images and videos and many documents.
The Luxembourg Central Bank has issued a silver coin for this occasion.
On 18 October 2007, the European Court of Auditors organised a seminar entitled "The Future of Public Financial Control in the EU...," attended by a number of high-level experts from EU countries and institutional managers.
IMPROVING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COURT'S CONTROL ASPECTS Many of the tasks set out in the Action Plan concern communication, which was the subject of increased efforts in 2007.
Among other things, a new website was introduced and information material was published on the annual report in a format that was easier to access and the Court agreed to a new procedure for the presentation of special reports to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament.
Other events, mostly directly or partly related to the action plan, related to the modernisation of the Court's accounting system and to new strategic documents in the field of human resources and IT.
The Court has also started to modernise its information systems for control, translation, knowledge and communication, management and staff information.
In addition, the Court made progress in 2007 in preparing the second extension of its main building, which is necessary in view of the recent and planned increase in the number of employees.
In 2008, the Court will present an annual report on the European Development Funds and specific annual reports on European agencies and other bodies together with an annual report on the EU general budget.
Expenditure under the general budget of the EU is planned for seven-year cycles, i.e. the financial framework.
2007 was the first year of the new financial framework focusing on the implementation of policies.
The Court takes this opportunity to discuss in more detail the innovations introduced in advance, namely the Commission's transition to business-related budgeting and management, as well as the distribution of the budget to 31 policy areas in which there are some 220 actions.
The annual report for the financial year 2007 is divided into groups of policy areas that are largely but not fully linked to the new headings of the financial framework.
Box 5 contains a summary of the selected control tasks which have been completed or completed, broken down by control group, and which should be published in 2008 or early 2009.

36 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION WITH THE NATIONAL EU CONTROL AUTHORITIES In accordance with the Treaty, the European Court of Auditors must carry out a check in the framework of the Court of Auditors in the framework of the Court of Auditors in the Member States' Supreme Audit Authorities of Amsterdam, and then add to the Treaty of Amsterdam: to the Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies in full confidence cooperate, respecting their independence.In the Nice Treaty, this system has been extended by a clear call on the Court of Auditors in the 18th Declaration of the Final Act to establish a Committee on contacts with national audit authorities, in which all the Presidents of the ORKB and the Court meet each year in order to discuss matters of common interest.
Ongoing contacts shall be maintained by liaison officers appointed by individual CMRs.
Working groups have been set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2007, the delegation of the Court attended the annual meeting of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the European Union Supervisory Committee in Helsinki on 3 and 4 December.
The meeting focused on risk management, acceptable risks and an integrated internal control system in the management of EU funds and aimed at discussing the role played by the ORK in this respect.
The Court will host the next meeting of the Contact Committee on 1 and 2 December 2008.
In 2007, two meetings of liaison officers were held in order to prepare a meeting of the Contact Committee.
The first meeting was held on 23 and 24 April in The Hague and the second in Luxembourg on 11 and 12 October, chaired by the European Court of Auditors.
The two meetings discussed recent developments in EU financial management and discussed the work of the Task Force on Cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation and cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation and cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation and cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation and cooperation in the field of cooperation in cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation in the field of cooperation.
The meeting also discussed the activities of the various working groups and expert groups set up by the Contact Committee to discuss specific issues of common interest.
The Court attended meetings of the networks of candidate and candidate countries under Horizon 2020 (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey).
On 11 and 12 June 2007, in Skopje (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) met in Skopje.
Control rules are an important aspect of all efforts to improve practical cooperation in the control of EU funds.
In this context, the Contact Committee decided in 2006 to set up a working group chaired by one of the members of the Court, Josef Bonnici, which should develop common control standards and comparable control standards, based on internationally recognised control principles and adapted to the EU context.
First European Court of Auditors meetings in Luxembourg in 2007.
In December 2007, the Helsinki Contact Committee received a progress report from the Working Group and adopted a resolution on the subject.
The Court continued its active participation and participation in the improvement of international control rules through membership of European and international organisations of public financial control bodies, including Eurosai and Intosai.
Within Eurosai, the Court is represented in the Working Party on the Environment and the Working Party on Information Technology and participates in the Eurosai Education Committee.
The Court hosted a seminar on the analysis of the most common problems of the ORKB IT in Luxembourg on 17 and 18 April 2007 and a seminar entitled "Economic Control" on 4 and 6 December 2007.
Since joining Intosai in 2004, as a full member of the Court, he has actively participated in the work of the Sub-Committee on Financial Audit Guidelines (FAS), the Sub-Committee on Audit of Compliance with Legal Standards (CAS) and the Sub-Committee on Economic Audit (PAS).
The Court has participated in all meetings of the vehicle alarm system held in 2007 and has actively contributed to the published and discussed guidelines.
The vehicle alarm system appointed a representative of the ERR (Mr Jesúsa Lázaro Cuenca) as one of the representatives of the vehicle alarm system as part of the draft Steering Committee of the Technical Standards Committee for Quality of Control. The Court also attended the CAS meeting in New Delhi in January 2007.
In addition, the Translation Directorate of the Court made available resources for the purpose of the language verification of the document in Spanish and German.
The Court also took part in the XIX Incosai Congress in Mexico on 5-10 November 2007, which raised two main issues: sovereign debt, governance, accountability, audit, and systems for assessing economic efficiency, based on commonly accepted key indicators.
In 2008, the Court will continue to participate actively in Eurosai and Intosai working groups, seminars and meetings.
37 Helsinki Contact Committee, December 2007.
38 STAFF POLICY The Court's most important capital is its staff.
They have a wide academic and professional environment and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's findings.
In its recent modernisation of staff policy, the Court focused on recruitment, training, career development and improving working conditions.
The percentage of men and women among 836 active servants (officials, temporary and contract staff, but without members, seconded national experts and trainees) was almost the same on 31 December 2007 (officials, temporary and contract staff, but without members, seconded national experts and trainees).
As shown in the chart below, the proportion of women employed in the Court has increased since 2001 as a result of the Court's efforts to achieve gender balance.
Percentage of male and female staff of the Court 46% 12/2001 54% of female 50% 12/2007 50%
The following graph provides an analysis of the participation of women and men by the breakdown of responsibilities as at 31 December 2007.
Like the other European institutions, the Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities for human resources management and recruitment and recognises the need for more active support for the increase of the number of women at the higher levels of the Court's management.
13 of 56 directors and heads of departments and departments (23%) are women, representing a 3% increase compared to 2006.
Most of them are busy with the Translation and Administrative Services Directorate.
12/2006 12/2006 M 67 % F 20% 12/2006 12/2007 M 77% 12/2006 M 80% 12/2007 M 64 % F 23 % 39 F 68 % M 32% M 32% W 68% F 68 % Office Boards of Directors W 33 % F 36 % JOBS OF MAN M 80% 12/2007 M 64 % F 23 % 39 F 68 % M 32% M 32% W 68% F 68 % Offices of Directors W 33 % F 36 % JOBS OF MEN MEN MEN MEN'S Directors and Directors of Departments and Departments (AD-niveau) Directors and Directors of Departments/Directors of Departments/Directives of Employment of the Court are in line with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institution and the staff are composed of both officials and contract staff.
In 2007, the Court had 179 staff: 117 officials, 35 temporary staff and 27 contract staff.
This large number reflects the progress made in 2007 in the area of job vacancies.
Employment of employees depends on the availability of reserve lists from EPSO competitions and on the availability of a sufficient number of candidates; this procedure is sometimes quite long and leads to a temporary increase in the number of job vacancies.
The Court is constantly seeking to shorten the time limits for the recruitment process.
PROFIL ALTERS LIABILITY OF CARRIERS The following chart shows that the Court is an organ young (63% of employees are younger than 44 years).
Among the 102 staff of the Court, who are 55 years of age or older, there are 27 of the 56 directors and heads of departments/references, which means that there will be significant changes at the highest levels over the next five to ten years.

These visits are normally applicable to central and local authorities involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds as well as to final beneficiaries.
The team of controllers usually consists of two to three controllers and the length of the examination trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and the distance.
In 2007, travel expenses related to control travel amounted to EUR 0.49 million (compared to EUR 0.43 million in 2006).
This represents a significant investment to ensure a sufficient level of control of all levels and the location of the management of EU funds.

In 2007, the Court's staff completed an average of 12 days of vocational training.
The percentage of specialised training increased significantly compared to 2006.
The main changes in training include training on the Court's performance control manual and related guidelines, the Commission's accounting rules, the use of accrual accounting (ABAC), SAP financial systems, and other IT applications and IT audits.
Language courses accounted for 52% of the total number of training days in 2007.
In 2008-2011, the Court adopted an indicative training plan, which provides for the development of vocational training in the coming years, one of the priorities being the implementation of individual development plans for individual workers.
The Court also examines the possibility of introducing a European Public Sector Auditor Diploma (POD).

The articles contained in many newspapers and the rapid reactions both in the Commission and in the Council have shown that the report is appropriate and timely.
The starting point for this success was a team composed of a dozen or so Court auditors who worked closely with the rapporteur member, Mr Kikis Kazamas, and his office.
Emmanuel Rauch, a French auditor who has worked on the farm for several years, and his Spanish colleague, Mr Alejandro Ballester, were team leaders during the preparatory phase in autumn 2005.
The audit included travel to six Member States, Denmark to Italy, both to central administrative authorities to gain insight into control systems and to major ports to assess how systems work in practice.
To the extent that the language of the members of the team was insufficient, the translators from the language service department of the Court provided assistance.
The team of auditors is very proud to have contributed to the fact that political decision-makers will gradually see the serious consequences of the implementation of the Community's fisheries policy.
Other audit authorities also expressed interest in the study as they provide inspiration and know-how, for example, in the case of an upcoming analysis of a similar issue in the Baltic States.

44 FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE Court'S BUDGET represents approximately 0,1% of the EU's general budget or 1.8% of the administrative budget of the EU institutions and bodies.
There has been an increase of 17% over the last three years.
This increase is mainly linked to the consequences of the enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007.
Further substantial increase in the Court's expenditure on construction works (building expenditure almost doubled between 2006 and 2008), as the future newly employed staff are to be employed in the second construction (building K3) to be completed in 2013.
In 2007, approximately 72% of the total budget comes from human resources.

The INTERNAL Service of the Court's Internal Audit Service shall support the Court in the achievement of its objectives through a systematic and methodological assessment of risk management, internal control and administrative procedures.
Furthermore, the Internal Audit Department presents proposals to improve the effectiveness of the Court.
Overall, the aim is to assess the performance of the different services in the implementation of strategies, programmes and actions to continuously improve.
In 2007, the Court's Internal Audit Department focused on auditing accounting (including supporting the work of the Court's external auditor), ex ante control, the implementation of internal control standards, the Court's recent enlargement (K2 Building) and the Court's recruitment procedures.
The Court's Internal Audit Committee, composed of three members of the Court and an external expert, shall monitor and ensure the independence of the internal auditor.
In addition, it shall examine and approve the work programme and the internal auditor's reports and, if necessary, entrust them with specific audit tasks.
The Committee met eight times in 2007.
In the opinion of the Court's external auditor for the financial year 2006, submitted on 28 September 2007, it follows from us that the annual accounts provide a true and fair view of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2006 and of the economic results for the financial year ending on that date, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and its implementing rules, the generally adopted accounting rules and the internal rules of the European Court of Auditors, as part of the external audit, and that the adequacy of administrative and accounting procedures and internal control and the consistency of financial management with the rules in force has not been established in the external audit.

The President's presentation of the Court of Auditors, as an independent EU audit body, makes a unique contribution to improving the EU's financial management and promoting transparency and accountability through the provision of audit services and as a model.
2008 was the year of significant progress and significant progress in the EU financial management referred to in this annual activity report for the Court.
An important event was the evaluation of the experts of the European Court of Auditors by an international expert group which led to a positive conclusion on the adequacy of the Court's audit management framework and the independence and objectivity of its work.
In its annual report for the financial year 2007, published in November 2008, the Court issued for the first time an opinion on the reliability of the EU accounts.
However, as in previous years, too high amounts of errors in legality and regularity have been identified in areas of the EU budget, which represent the largest part of the expenditure.
In 2008, the Court also recognised changes at EU and national level which could lead to significant improvements in the EU's financial management in the future.
The two examples presented in this Annual Activity Report relate to the ongoing review process of the EU budget to which the Court has made an active contribution and to the Commission Communication on the Acceptable Risk of Error.
In the field of international relations, the Court has overseen the organisation of the meetings of the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the European Union's Supreme Audit Authorities on the reform of the EU's budget and the renewed Lisbon Strategy, and has also played a host role in recent EU-ORKB-related workshops in the context of the action taken in response to the current financial crisis.
Following rapid changes in the audit environment, the Court is forced to adapt through internal reforms in order to better fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to fulfil its tasks effectively.
In 2008, the Court took significant steps to implement its mandate and its action plan to develop the audit strategy for 2009-2012.
The audit strategy is based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of controls and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will be essential for the Court's work programmes during this period, as well as its efforts to continuously improve and exploit the main challenges and opportunities to exploit the potential for improvement as set out in the peer review procedure.
Through their competences and involvement, the Court's staff have a key role to play in carrying out the Court's audit work as an independent guardian of the citizens' financial interests in order to improve financial management.
On behalf of the Court and on my own behalf, I would like to thank all the workers for their commitment and professional work last year.
Special thanks for his personal commitment and commitment are due to our former secretary-general, Michel Hervé, who was expelled at the end of 2008.
I wish you a pleasant look at this annual activity report, which will give you insight into the Court and a review of the actions taken in 2008.

THE COURT'S ROLE AND WORK THE COURT'S WORK IS THE EU BUDGET The European Union's budget is around EUR 120 billion, representing around 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of the 27 Member States.
However, for some Member States EU funding plays an important role in funding public actions, which corresponds approximately to the GNI of some Member States.
The European Union's revenue consists mainly of contributions from Member States from their gross national income (GNI of 65,4%) or VAT collected by Member States (VAT of 16,9%).
Customs duties and agricultural duties (so-called traditional own resources. 16,5 %) also represent a significant part of revenue.
Over time, the structure of the budget has changed and agricultural and cohesion policy are the main areas of expenditure (see Box 1).

The EU budget is financed by Member States' financial contributions (mainly on the basis of national GNI) and by agricultural duties and duties.
The EU budget is largely used for purposes other than the national budget, partly due to differences in competence.
For example, the Union is not responsible for social security systems, which usually represent a significant part of national expenditure.
Since the 1960s, agricultural expenditure, usually in the form of payments to farmers across the Union, has been the main part of the budget expenditure, although it is currently in decline.
In 2009, 45.3% of the budget for the conservation and management of natural resources, mainly for agriculture and rural development, was foreseen.
Since the 1980s, a significant part of the expenditure on cohesion policy, i.e. regional and social development, has been earmarked for co-financing various projects, ranging from road construction projects in Poland to training for unemployed people in Spain.
For 2009, sustainable growth expenditure of 39.6% of the budget is foreseen, of which cohesion policy is part.
This budgetary area also covers the majority of the EU's research budget.
Furthermore, to a large extent, EU funding is devoted to development aid and humanitarian aid, as well as to countries which have close relations with the Union or are candidate countries.
6.7% of the budget is allocated to the management of the Community institutions.
Citizenship, freedom, security and justice The European Union, as an international partner The management of agriculture for the conservation and management of natural resources 45.3 % 1.2 % 7.2 % 6.7 % of EU expenditure on cohesion for sustainable growth Source: European Union general budget for the financial year 2009 (OJ L 69, 13.3.2009). 39.6%
The budget shall be approved annually by the Council on the basis of the seven-year financial framework, i.e. representatives of the Member States, and by the European Parliament, on a proposal from the European Commission.
The Commission shall draw up the budget and be responsible for its implementation.
Most of the budget, in particular, in particular, in the field of agricultural and cohesion policy expenditure, shall be conducted in cooperation with Member States.
A specific feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments on the basis of applications of the beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers, across the Union8.
Democratic society needs complete and reliable public information as a basis for discussion and decision-making, both to improve financial management and to ensure accountability.
The EU, like its Member States, has an external audit body, which acts as an independent guardian of the financial interests of citizens.
The European Court of Auditors, acting as an external EU auditor, ensures that EU funds, wherever they are used, have been properly booked and spent in accordance with the law, taking due account of the optimal spending of funds.
The Court's audit work is used by Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States to improve the EU's financial management.
The Court's work provides an important basis for the annual discharge procedure during which Parliament, on the basis of Council recommendations, decides whether the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility for the implementation of the budget during the previous year.
Despite its name, the Court has no judicial powers.
In the budgetary areas where shared management is carried out, Member States shall cooperate with the Commission in the establishment of monitoring and control systems, i.e. internal control, in order to ensure the proper and proper use of the funds.
Internal control therefore has a European and national dimension.
In addition to the Court's activities, many national audit authorities check whether EU funds are managed and spent by public authorities in the Member States.

How does the Court present its results?
The Court publishes the results of its audit work in the following types of reports: annual reports on the results of audit of financial statements in the form of a statement of assurance for the implementation of the general budget2 and on the activities carried out under the European Development Fund3.

2 In accordance with the Treaty, the Court is required to issue such a statement or a review opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
In this context, the underlying transactions are usually payments to final beneficiaries from the EU budget.
The annual statement of assurance is commonly known under the acronym DAS (e.g. Déclaration d.Assurance).
Unlike practices in the Member States, the Court makes such a statement on the EU budget as a whole.
3 The European Development Fund (EDF) is based both on international agreements concluded between the Community and its Member States and certain African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP)
The Court carries out an audit of the EU's annual accounts in accordance with the International Audit Principles (ISA), which apply both in the public and private sectors.
However, the existing international control rules do not fully cover the Court's compliance control.
The Court, in cooperation with national audit bodies, actively participates in the development of international audit standards promoted by standardisation bodies (INTOSAI, IFAC) 4.
In order to ensure compliance of payments with the rules and legal framework, the Court is based on the results of an analysis of both supervisory and control systems to prevent and detect and correct errors of legality and regularity and on the sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Where systems are reviewed and are considered reliable, the number of transactions which the Court must examine in order to obtain reliable conclusions on their legality and regularity.
Other sources, such as the work of other auditors, are also used to support the Court's conclusions.
In the case of performance control, the Court uses a number of control methods to assess management and monitoring systems and to assess performance data on the basis of the criteria under the rules on sound financial management.
With regard to the selection of topics for performance control, the Court seeks to identify the control areas for which the greatest impact can be expected in the form of the exposed potential for improvement in the savings, efficiency and effectiveness of EU expenditure. 11 the Council decision on the association of overseas countries and territories (OCTs) is closed.
The Commission manages most of the expenditure related to ACP countries, partly through the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (see the policy areas "External relations, development and enlargement') and partly through delegations in beneficiary countries.

Therefore, in order to obtain results representative of the population as a whole, in connection with the preparation of DAS, it uses statistical sampling methods.
The sample shall be carried out by random selection of a representative sample of transactions underlying the underlying transactions from all areas of the Union budget, such as agriculture, in order to carry out a detailed assessment.
The Court monitors these operations up to the final recipient of the aid, for example the farmer in France.
The Court then carries out on-the-spot checks, for example, to determine whether the relevant information contained in the proposal is in line with the reality.
Where the statistical sample is statistical, the results may be calculated for the population concerned, i.e. for a specific area of revenue or expenditure, and may, together with the information resulting from the evaluation of the system, form the basis for the overall assessment.
In order to determine how the audit opinion must be issued, the Court, in practice, compares the results of statistical checks in trials with the specific ceiling it considers acceptable in relation to the so-called materiality threshold.
Accidental selection of representative sample Payment to the agricultural holding in France Population of agricultural payments
The Court of Auditors shall act as a collegial body consisting of 27 members from each Member State.
All audit reports and opinions shall be adopted by the College.
The Court shall consist of five audit groups to which individual members shall be assigned.
As is apparent from the organisational chart (see page 17), there are four thematic control groups covering different budgetary areas (protection and management of natural resources and structural measures, transport, research and energy, external resources, income, banking activities, administrative expenditure, Community institutions and bodies and internal policies).
The Fifth Audit Group (CEAD or coordination, communication, evaluation, quality assurance and development) is responsible for horizontal issues such as coordination in the field of assurance, quality assurance, the development of the audit methodology of the Court and the general dissemination of the Court's audit results and reports.
In addition, the Management Committee shall be responsible for preparing all administrative matters requiring a formal decision of the Court.
MEMBERS of the Court shall be appointed by the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, for a six-year term, as proposed by each Member State, with the possibility of re-election.
Members shall carry out their tasks in the full independence in the general interest of the European Union.
In addition to the functions of the College, which is responsible for final decisions on audits and opinions, as well as on broader strategic and administrative issues, each member shall be responsible for its specific tasks, particularly in the field of audit.
The proper examination work is usually the task of examiners in each examination department and is coordinated by the relevant member with the support of his office.
The member shall then adopt the report in the audit group or in the Court and after its adoption in the European Parliament, the Council and other interested parties.
On 1 January 2008, three new members, Mr Michel Cretin (France), Mr Harald Noack (Germany) and Mr Henri Grethen (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg) (Luxembourg)
The Council also extended the mandate of four members: Hubert Weber (Austria), Maarten B. England (the Netherlands), David Bostock (the United Kingdom) and Ioannis Sarmas (Greece) for a period of six years.
The President-in-Office of the European Court of Auditors shall be the President, elected from among the members of the European Court of Auditors for a period of three years, with the possibility of re-election.
The President shall represent the Court in all its external relations, in particular in relations with the discharge authority, with the other institutions of the European Union and with the highest audit bodies of the Member States and the beneficiary countries.
On 16 January 2008, a Portuguese member, Mr Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, was elected President of the Court. 14
The Secretary-General of the Secretary-General shall be the highest-ranking member of the institution and shall be appointed by the Court for a period of six years and shall be renewable.
The Secretary-General shall be responsible for the management of the Court's staff and staff, including vocational training and the Translation Directorate, including one department in the official language (22), with the exception of Irish.
The Secretary-General shall also be responsible for the secretariat of the Court.
The former Secretary-General, Michel Hervé, left the Court on 31 October 2008.

SUMMARY OF THE AUDIT REPORTS AND OPINION5 OF THE ANNUAL REPORTS FROM THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2007 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET AND THE BUDGET
The limits set out in last year's annual report on the reliability of the accounts for the financial year 2006 no longer apply due to improvements made in 2007.
In certain areas, such as the Union's administrative expenditure, the Court gives unlimited opinions on legality and regularity.
However, the Court cannot deliver an unlimited opinion on most expenditure areas.
Although most of the payments audited by the Court have been carried out in accordance with the rules, the Court still considers that the level of error in payments to final beneficiaries, such as farmers and beneficiaries of projects financed by EU funds, is too high.
Except for cohesion policy measures whose error rate is at least 11%, the error rate estimated by the Court is between 2 and 5% in these thematic areas.
In some expenditure areas, in particular in areas previously covered by internal or external policies, the estimated error rate has decreased but would not change the overall picture in this way.
The result does not imply that these infringements result from fraud or that most transactions in these areas are illegal or illegal.
SITUATION IN CERTAIN AREAS In three areas: In the era of administrative and administrative, economic and financial expenditure and revenue, the Court's audits of a representative sample of transactions showed a low estimated error rate.
In the largest area of expenditure of the Union, hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy hy h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
The disproportionately high proportion of this error rate lies in rural development, including often complex schemes.
In the case of expenditure of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF), the error rate estimated by the Court is almost below the materiality threshold of 2%.
As in previous years, cohesion policy, representing more than one third of the budget, is the area in which the biggest errors occur.
On the basis of the Court's random estimates, at least 11% of the total amount of the refund should not have been paid.
5 This section aims to introduce rather than to a summary a summary of the Court's reports and opinions.
For more information, see the full text of the Court's documents published on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) after their adoption.
19 RULES FOR IMPROVING MONITORING AND CONTROL The high level of error in areas such as cohesion is partly due to inherent risks arising from a large number of beneficiaries applying for EU funding under complex rules and regulations.
The shortcomings in the design and functioning of the systems also contribute to the shortcomings identified.
Most EU funded programmes contain provisions on corrective actions which, on a multi-annual basis, provide for the recovery of funds unduly paid for errors.
However, there is no information on the impact of these measures.
This means that it cannot be established whether the proportion of illegal or illegal expenditure can be effectively reduced.
Since 2000, the Commission has been working on a reform programme to improve the management of the EU budget, including the 2006 Action Plan.
By the end of 2007, the Commission carried out two thirds of the sub-measures provided for in the Action Plan.
However, it is too early to assess the impact of these measures.
Improved high-level controls, for example, monitoring by the Commission of Member States' controls at Member State level do not compensate for inadequate controls at lower level, such as on-the-spot checks.
However, the benefits of increased on-the-spot checks should be considered in relation to costs.
The Court recommends that the Union's political bodies determine the appropriate level of risk of error.
In order to reduce the level of error in EU payments, the Court recommends simplifying legislation and legislation, improving internal control measures and improving monitoring and reporting.
20 BOX 3 WEEKLY REVIEW OF THE TRUTH AND TRUTH OF THE WEEKS OF WEEKS OF EXPENDITURE The table summarises the overall assessment of supervisory and control systems in accordance with the relevant chapters of the 2007 Annual Report and presents an overall review of the results of the Court's audits in respect of representative samples of transactions.

For the EFF, the annual accounts of the European Development Fund (EDF) present, in all material respects, a true and fair view of the financial situation and the performance of the EFF.
The opinion on the legality and regularity of EDF transactions in respect of payments is limited.
In addition, a further 28 special annual reports on European agencies and other decentralised bodies were adopted in 2008.
21 BOX 4 BOX INTERPRETATION OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE REPRESENTENTS OF THE REPRESENTENTS OF THE EXPRESENTS OF THE EXPRESENTS OF THE EXPRESSENTS OF THE EXPRESENTS may issue the following opinions: • unlimited audit opinion if it is proven that the accounting or the underlying transactions, i.e. payments, are legal and correct in all material respects; • negative audit opinion if the level of error in the underlying transactions is material or comprehensive or not reliable; • refusal to issue an audit opinion where the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient and sufficient evidence to support the audit opinion and its possible consequences; • limited audit opinion where the level of error in the underlying transactions cannot be issued without reservation or limited to the scope of control is not so important or comprehensive that it requires the issue of a negative audit opinion or the issue of an opinion.
SPECIAL REPORTS PUBLISHED IN 2008The Court published a total of twelve special reports in 2008.
In order to improve the readability and readability of the reports, the Court decided to publish its special reports in a new format and to make them available directly on its website (www.eca.europa.eu), with only reference to their publication in the Official Journal.
As in previous years, the reports dealt with investigations into financial management in many different fields, ranging from the effectiveness of the European Solidarity Fund (N° 3/2008) to actions to support the European Union for the storage of cereals in public storage (N° 11/2008).
The Court's audits have revealed various problems with different impacts and have led to recommendations on improving financial management and improving efficiency and efficiency.
The thematic choice for the audit of the performance of tasks and their project are the responsibility of the Court and are based on criteria such as risk analysis, potential for improvement and public interest.
In its 2008 special reports, broken down by thematic themes In 2008, the Court answered the following questions: Conservation and management of natural resources: • Did the procedure for fixing national milk quotas in the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 lead to the implementation of the management and operational control system in due time?
(No 3/2008) • Has the Commission planned, monitored and evaluated the Intelligent Energy • Europe (to promote energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and the diversification of energy supply) and has the executive agency responsible for implementing the programme had a positive impact on programme management?

The Court also contributes to improving the EU's financial management by issuing opinions on proposals or issues relating to financial management in 2008.
These opinions are required as part of the procedure for the adoption of financial rules7 or may be issued at the request of one of the other Community institutions8.
The Court may also present own-initiative opinions.
The Court's opinions may concern certain areas of EU expenditure, such as the revision of the Financial Regulation of the European Aviation Safety Agency (No 1/2008) or issues relating to EU revenue, such as the revision of the Regulation on the system of the Communities' own resources (No 2/2008).
Opinions are based on the Court's expertise in the financial management of the EU over the years in the course of the audit and in some cases relate to certain audits or opinions.
For example, in its opinion on the new Financial Regulation of the European Joint Undertaking for the Reactor of the Reactor, the Court refers to its annual report for the financial year 2006, in which it has already highlighted the high risks associated with the legality and regularity of the research aid payments.

Persecution and Effectiveness Public control plays a key role in promoting accountability and contributes to public debate.
The control activities shall be transmitted to the addressees at the end of the information chain, in this case to European citizens, in order to determine whether their taxpayers' money is spent properly and properly.
The Court's audits serve decision-makers in the institutions concerned in the European context in particular to Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States, as a direct source of information.
On the basis of this information, they may take action with or without reference to the conclusions of the checks.
Although the Court's audit activities have a significant impact on the published reports, the impact on the entire audit process is already certain.
In its replies, the audited entity often takes into account the problems identified by the Court and presents the steps it intends to take to resolve them.
Following the completion of the audit work and the publication of the report, the audit results shall be evaluated and used by Parliament and the Council to carry out their policy tasks to monitor the use of budgetary resources.
In the framework of the Court's annual discharge procedure, the Court's reports form the basis for the Council's recommendation and Parliament's decision.
29 Examples of this are found in the discharge procedure for the implementation of the 2007 budget, in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to make efforts to simplify and further clarify the rules in order to reduce the risk of errors, to improve controls and to reduce costs.
This applies both to shared management areas and to expenditure on agriculture and cohesion policy, as well as to direct management areas, as well as expenditure on research, culture and education.
Special reports shall also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
However, as they are published during the year, the presentation of special reports and the discussion of them were usually held at Parliament and Council meetings at an earlier stage.
The impact of the audit reports can be increased by their involvement in the relevant media, which will increase their attention and encourage public debate.
As a general rule, the media reports for the Court's annual report are quite extensive, but the press has also followed some special reports with interest.
An example of this is the special report on cross compliance (No 8/2008), which was published at the time of the adoption of the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Due to the importance of cross compliance and its key role within the CAP and the moment of its publication, in various media, the report gives a broad picture: TV, newspapers, specialist newspapers, Internet publications (press, farmers' associations, MIP websites, Internet blogs, etc.).
The report has also been widely discussed in the European Parliament and almost all the recommendations of the Court have been taken into account in the draft report on discharge.
Detailed information on the follow-up to the Court's earlier observations can be found in the relevant chapters of the Court's annual report.
The most frequently reported statement of the Court in its most recent annual report is that, despite the actions taken, the shortcomings identified in the previous year have only been partially resolved.
The Court's objective is to examine the long-term effects of its work more and more and its views.
An example of this is the fact that the Court uses the Commission's database, which is the basis for assessing the impact of its audits, together with the actions to be taken with regard to the audit recommendations.
The evaluation may lead to separate detailed studies leading to further findings and recommendations.
They may be taken into account in the special report on the field concerned or in the report on the follow-up and impact of the recommendations on financial management.
The Court's position on the conclusion of the DANGEROUS RISK As a result of the development of the Community internal control framework, in its opinion No 2/2004, the Court stated that it was up to the political authorities to decide on the level of risk that they are prepared to accept when approving the Union's expenditure systems.
The Court proposed that Parliament and the Council agree on the right balance between the costs and the benefits of control, in other words, with the acceptable residual risk of error in expenditure.
The costs of controls should be proportionate to the monetary and political benefits they bring.
Since this opinion was published, both the European Parliament and the Council have expressed their willingness in their resolutions on discharge to take further action on this issue and to have a common understanding of the acceptable level of risk.
At the end of 2008, the Commission issued a communication entitled "Towards a common understanding of the concept of tolerated risk of error. "
The Court welcomed this communication and forwarded the Commission's reply indicating certain limitations and presenting the main aspects to be taken into account in the future follow-up to this case.
In its Communication, the Commission notes that any decision on the acceptable risk of error should, inter alia, be based on the potential for further simplification.
The Court also stresses the importance and benefits of further simplification and the potential impact on the reduction of errors and irregularities.
The concept of error risk which can be diversified must be clearly separated from the concept of materiality threshold, defined and applied by the Court, which falls within the competence of the external auditor10.
The Court considers that an analysis of the costs and benefits of expenditure programmes could provide information not only on the acceptable risks but also on the review of the regulatory framework and the governance structure of the programmes concerned.
In this context, an important issue may not concern whether there is an acceptable risk of error, but whether there is such a high risk of error that there is a need to abolish/regulate or substantially change a given system or programme.
In developing expenditure or revenue schemes or programmes, particular attention should also be paid to the concept of acceptable risks.
It would be useful if there were sufficient information at the time of the adoption of the expenditure programmes on the risks involved and on the costs of the planned controls in order to reduce these risks to an acceptable level.
In this way, decisions would be made in an informed manner, in a clear way, taking into account the risks and costs involved.
The budgetary reform process may be an opportunity to reflect on how the Court proposed reform, a change in Europe, in response to a Commission communication entitled "Budget"11.
31 10 The concept of "incompatibility" is defined in the International Rule of Control of ISA 320 as follows: "information" is essential in cases where their omission or misrepresentation is likely to affect the economic decisions taken by delegates on the basis of the accounts on the basis of the accounts.
Validity depends on the size of the position or error resulting from the special circumstances of departure from the position or error.
Therefore, importance is rather a threshold or a limit, rather than a basic quality requirement, which must be informed in order to be useful........ 11 See the European Court of Auditors' response to the Commission's communication "Budgetary reform," a change of Europe...April 2008.

A summary of this document is available on the Court's website.
The Court's strategy is based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of controls and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will have a significant impact on the Court's work programmes during this period and on its efforts to continue to improve.
The Court seeks to maximise the overall impact of the audits over a given period by selecting and drawing up audits which focus on the risks and which are of the greatest interest to the Court's addressees; • continue to submit and verify the conclusions of the audits and useful proposals for improvements to be implemented; • carry out a wider spectrum of audits and submit new types of control products which complement the current annual and special reports; • develop more special reports which are close to and facilitate their use; • maintain relations with the main addressees, including the relevant parliamentary committees, as well as with the media and the general public; in this period the Court seeks to improve efficiency by making the best use of resources.
This includes: • better management; • effective and dynamic human resources policy; • rationalisation of control tasks; • improvement of IT tools; • improvement of expertise; • improvement of relations with audited entities34.
The 2009 work programme includes the preparation of annual reports which show the results of the audit of the accounts which the Court must carry out in accordance with the Treaty and other EU legislation.
In 2009, the Court identified a number of audit topics concerning the development of EU financial management policies and issues.
With regard to the development of EU policies, the following topics have been selected: • growth and employment; • climate change and sustainable development; • Europe as an international partner; • better regulation.
In addition, the Court draws attention to the following issues in the area of EU financial management, which, in its view, deserve special attention: • the completion of expenditure programmes for 2000-2006, in particular in the area of the Structural Funds; • the responsibility and reform of the EU; • the progress made in implementing the Commission action plan for an integrated internal control framework, taking into account the concept of acceptable risks; • management and control activities at Member State level.
The Court's objective is to address these issues from 2009 in the framework of annual reports, special reports and some new types of reports (see below).
The Court intends to publish a number of special reports and related new reports drawn up on the basis of the audit tasks it has chosen.
The planning and implementation of the selected control tasks and the reporting of these tasks usually lasts longer than one year.
Most reports published in a given year are therefore based on the audit work launched in previous years.
Box 5 contains selected audit tasks which have been completed or to be completed and should therefore be published in special reports in 2009 or early 2010.
35 12 A more detailed and detailed review of the Court's future work can be found in the Court's 2009 work programme, available on its website (www.eca.europa.eu).
Follow-up to recommendations is an important tool for the Court to actively contribute to improving financial management.
This report will analyse the extent to which our recommendations have been followed and, where appropriate, assess the effectiveness of the actions taken.
It is expected to be published around the same time as the annual report, at the same time as the annual report, in the second new type of report, which the Court intends to present, is the report on high-risk areas related to EU financial management.
The report is addressed to the new Commission, which will start work at the end of the year, and is intended to serve as guidance to the Commission.
In 2006, the Court carried out a self-assessment which identified its strengths and weaknesses.
An action plan was then drawn up to address shortcomings.
The Action Plan included a number of actions which led to the Court to define how, its mandate, strategic objectives and strategic planning, • develop internal performance indicators to be implemented gradually (see section below); • adopt an internal communication strategy which is already being implemented and open up new channels to improve the dissemination of information within the institutions; • adopt a number of actions to improve the quality of its reports, for example through new graphic planning to improve the legibility and external evaluation; • adopt a strategy to improve the Court's relations with its addressees, the press and the wider public.
In 2009, as part of its efforts to improve, the Court will seek to take into account the observations and recommendations contained in the international report on the peer review of the European Court of Auditors, published in December 2008, which represents an important step in the Court's ongoing reform process.
The expert assessment of colleagues (peer review) was carried out by representatives of the national control bodies of Canada, Norway, Austria and Portugal.
In 2008, the co-workers carried out work and contacted the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control in this context and the final report was presented at the end of 2008.
The purpose of the peer review procedure was to assess the concept and functioning of the control framework established by the Court.
The evaluation covered the following areas: • planning and control procedures for auditing accounting checks and performance checks; • reporting on the results of the audit; • the services assisting the Court in achieving its objectives.
The peer review team concluded that the structure of the control framework established by the Court is in line with international control rules and good practice for the highest control authorities.
In addition, experts have found that • the Court carries out its activities in an independent and objective manner; • the Court's audit reports are based on appropriate and appropriate audit evidence, in accordance with international audit principles; • the parties concerned are based on high confidence in the Court's reports and generally consider them to be fair, objective and objective.
The Court welcomes the constructive comments and recommendations of stakeholders which show how it can continue to strengthen its role as the Supreme Audit Authority and highlight the challenges involved.
This includes, inter alia, the need to:• develop a culture that focuses on the Court's uniform approach as an audit body;• strengthen quality assurance and quality control activities to develop a coherent interpretation and application of its strategy and control methods;• develop risk-based control strategies to make the best use of resources to meet the different needs of the addressees.
The peer review report concluded that most of the recommendations were already foreseen in advance in the action plan drawn up before the start of the procedure.
The Court intends to incorporate the other recommendations in its audit strategy for 2009-2012 after the exchange with employees and addressees and will make every effort to implement them in that period.
EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS INTERNATIONAL PEER REVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITOR 38
IN 2008 the Court decided to introduce a system of key performance indicators (CL) for its audit and non-audit activities to measure the performance of the Court's strategic objectives and objectives set out in the annual work programme.
The aim of the CLI is to strengthen internal and external responsibility and to increase productivity and quality of work.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK THANK THANK DAY THANK DAY THANK DAY THANK THANK THANK DAY THANK DAY THANK DAY THANKDAY DAY THANKDAY THANKDAY THANKDAY THANKDAY DAY THANKDAY THANKDAY DAY DAY THANKDAY THANKDAY THANKDAY DAY DAY DAY THANKDAY DAY DAY DAY THANKDAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY DAY
They aim to present the Court's results as undertakings and become an integral part of the Court's management system.
The quantity and quality of the audit work can also be improved by considering the impact of the Court's reports and opinions on financial management.
The four key performance indicators (from 1 to 4) measure the impact of the Court's work.
They will be designed to be included in the Court's annual work programme for 2010.
In 2008, the Court carried out a test assessment of the results on the basis of ZLI 5 and 6.
ZLI 5 LI the number of reports adopted in relation to the number of reports planned In 2008, the Court adopted 79 % of the number of reports planned.

In December 2008, the Court hosted the annual meeting of the EU-ORKB Contact Committee.
The meeting focused on the reform of the EU budget and on the renewed Lisbon Strategy for the period 2008-2011.
The Contact Committee shall seek to strengthen cooperation between its members in order to improve external control and accountability in the EU area.
Over the years, the role of the Contact Committee has developed in parallel with European integration.
In addition to facilitating the exchange of information between the OPCW and the OPCW, the Authority has made significant progress in the effective cooperation between the different control bodies.
At its 2007 Helsinki meeting, the Contact Committee recognised the need to address emerging or new issues in due time and agreed to establish a permanent agenda item in order to address such current issues.
In this context, the Contact Committee discussed the economic and financial crisis at its meeting in 2008 and agreed to organise workshops on the role of the EU-ORKB in the context of the crisis.
A network was subsequently set up to promote cooperation on controls related to the Lisbon Strategy and EU crisis management activities.
The Court participated in the meetings of the ORKK network of candidate and candidate countries in the field (Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro).
These meetings were held at the same time as the liaison officers' meetings in May and October.
In addition, the delegation of the Court participated in the workshops organised by the Ankara network in Turkey on 8 and 9 July in order to examine/assess the internal control systems of public finances.
Throughout 2008 the Court has actively participated in the various working groups set up by the Contact Committee.
The working group on common control standards.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Since December 2008, the Court has taken over the (mobile) presidency of the Working Party on VAT and the network of agricultural experts has resumed its activities under the leadership of one of the members of the Court.
The Court continued to actively participate in the improvement of international control rules and procedures through membership of European and international organisations of public financial control bodies, including EUROSAI and INTOSAI.
The delegation of the Court took part in the VII Congress of EUROSAI, which took place on 2-5 June in Krakow (Poland).
Among the main topics of the discussion were the introduction of quality management systems, which will be based on evaluation, the review of social programmes in the field of education and vocational integration of people with disabilities.
The President of the Court has contributed to the role of the management of the quality management system in the audit field.
Within EUROSAI, the Court is represented in the Working Party on the Environment and the Working Party on Information Technology and participates in the EUROSAI Education and Education Committee.
It also participates in the work of the Working Group set up at the 7th EUROSAI Conference in order to develop a guide on best practices in order to achieve quality within the ORB.
The Court is also a member of the EUROSAI Task Force on the control of civil protection assistance measures. 42
At the EUROSAI Congress, the European Court of Auditors, together with the highest audit authority of the Slovak Republic, was appointed auditor for the period 2009-2011.
Since joining INTOSAI in 2004, as a full member of the Court, he has been actively involved in the work of the Sub-Committee on the Financial Audit Guidelines (FAS), the Sub-Committee on the Control of Compliance with Legal Standards (CAS) and the Sub-Committee on Economic Control (PAS).
The Court has contributed to the subcommittee to promote best practices and quality assurance through voluntary peer reviews.
Since 2008, the Court has chaired the Working Group on Liability and Control of Civil Protection Assistance (the Civil Protection Assistance Authority of the INTOSAI Task Force on tsunami).
The first meeting of this working group was organised by the Court as host of the period from 30 June to 2 July 2008.
This meeting discussed and adopted the draft work programme for the period 2008-2010.
The main objective is to develop guidelines on accountability and control in this area, and all stakeholders should be developed in this area through the competent standardisation bodies.
In addition to the coordination function, the Court has assumed responsibility for a number of tasks, two of which, in cooperation with the Norwegian Court of Auditors.
The Presidency of this working group also requires the Court to be represented at INTOSAI Bureau meetings 43.
Among the 857 staff (officials, temporary and contract staff, but without members, seconded national experts and trainees) who served actively on 31 December 2008, 501 served as an auditor and examiner, 163 served as an interpreter and 173 served as an administrative assistant and 20 served as an assistant to the Chair.
They have a broad academic and professional background and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's findings.
As regards the human resources sector, the Court identified the assessment of the level of satisfaction of the Court's employees as the main performance indicator (CL 9).
A study was carried out with satisfaction with the aim of providing information on the subject and supporting the decision-making process in this area.

In 2008, the Court had 97 staff: 48 officials, 18 temporary staff and 31 contract staff.
Recruitment depends on the availability of reserve lists from EPSO competitions.
Due to the deficit of the relevant candidates, the Court was unable to employ as many new workers as was planned, so at the end of 2008 the total number of job vacancies (69) was higher than at the end of 2007.
However, it should be noted that there was a significant number of recruitments at the end of the year, and the workers concerned should start working in the first quarter of 2009.
The Court is currently working to shorten the time limits for recruitment procedures.
Translation is an important administrative task that enables the Court to achieve its communication objectives and is in line with the legal obligation to publish in 22 languages.
In 2008, the number of translations increased by 17%, mainly due to the adoption of more special reports.
The vast majority of translations are made internally and during peak periods during which normal translation capacity has been exceeded, translation orders are given to the Translation Centre (CTOU) or to external translation agencies.
In addition, translators participate in examinations visits and support examiners before, during and after examinations trips, including in subsequent phases of the preparation of test reports.
Translators provide constant assistance in updating intranet content and website in English and French.
They also support INTOSAI working groups and meet other specific needs related to the Court's activities.
The Translation Directorate of the Court actively participates in the work of the Interinstitutional Translation Committee (CITI), is a member of international committees and participates in international conferences on the development of electronic translation and documentation tools.
CONTROL During the Court's audit work, auditors must travel to the Member States and to other beneficiary countries of EU funds to obtain appropriate evidence.
These visits normally apply to central and local authorities involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds, as well as to final beneficiaries.
The team of controllers usually consists of two to three controllers and the length of the examination trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and the distance.
In the EU, controls are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities in the visited Member State, which provide useful logistical and practical support 47.
In 2008, the cost of the check-up trip was 3.29 million euro.
This extensive investment is essential to ensure sufficient coverage of all levels and location of EU fund management.
The table below shows the number of audit visits carried out by the Court in the EU Member States and outside the EU in 2008.

BORDER EDUCATION The profession of examiner requires continuous training.
In 2008, the Court's staff averaged 10 days of vocational training.
The number of specialised trainings increased significantly compared to 2007.
In 2008, the Court strengthened its support for the participation of its staff in continuous programmes for the acquisition or maintenance of professional qualifications and qualifications in the field of external audit, internal audit and IT audit.
Language courses accounted for 48% of the total number of training days in 2008 (compared with 52% in 2007).
In 2008, without taking into account language courses, the auditors completed seven days of vocational training.
Based on the long-term strategic objective Towards growth and growth Along with the training plan for 2008-2011 and the training paths adopted in 2008, the vocational training department introduced... the content of training activities has been extended and new training courses have been developed in line with the priorities adopted by the Court.
Furthermore, cooperation with other interinstitutional institutions and institutions, such as the European Administrative School, has been successfully continued.
Box 6 presents a portrait of the employees of selected departments or departments within the Court to show the reader an insight into the work done, the employees involved in the work and their background and professional experience. 49

It shall include the procedures laid down for the allocation of funds for each project, monitoring and evaluation procedures, administrative costs and the impact of the establishment of an executive agency.
The study team worked closely with the rapporteur member, David Bostock.
The head of the control department was Hendrik Fehr, head of the Peggy Vercauteren team.
The band included Oliver Müller, Peter Zsapka, Zoltán Giday and Carl-Christian Buhr, and Gerhard Ross, Thomas af Hällström and Peter Welch from David Bostock's office also played an important role.
The audit included a study aimed at obtaining information from a broad group of participants.
Various cost accounting techniques were used to supplement and supplement the information available to the Commission.
The audit showed that the programme was managed in accordance with the Commission's usual approaches and guidelines.
However, the expenditure model was not sufficiently targeted and monitoring and evaluation did not allow the overall quality of the programme to be assessed.
During the duration of the programme, relatively high administrative costs (for the Commission, the Agency and participants) fell approximately equal to the amount paid to participants during the same period.
The creation of an executive agency has improved the satisfaction of the participants in the programme.

The Court's budget budget for 2009 is approximately 0.16% of the EU's general budget or 2.4% of the administrative budget of the EU institutions and bodies.
Compared to 2008, an increase of 41 % was noted, mainly due to the Court's budget for construction work, since, after further increase in employment, workers will have to be accommodated in the second building (building K3), which will be completed in 2013.
Negotiations were launched with the budgetary authorities on the financing rules in February 2008.
Therefore, the construction project, the total cost of which is estimated at EUR 79 million, is financed from four successive annual budgets.
In October 2008, the budgetary authority approved the EUR 55 million tranche for the 2009 budget.
In 2009, some 52% of the total budget comes from human resources.

Overall, the aim is to assess the performance of the different services in the implementation of strategies, programmes and actions to continuously improve.
In 2008, the Court's Internal Audit Department focused on the audit of accounting records, ex ante control, recruitment of employees, assistance and recruitment allowances, expenditure on buildings, expenditure on services and services, the implementation of the IT strategy and the review of the IT control framework.
Most audit recommendations issued by the internal auditor in 2008 were adopted by the evaluation bodies and incorporated in the corrective action plans.
In 2008, the Internal Audit Committee met six times and focused on monitoring the recommendations of the Internal Auditor.
Other issues concerned the Committee's 2007 activity report and the Court's report to the discharge authority for the activity of the Internal Auditor's Office for 2007.
The Internal Audit Committee held two meetings with the Court's independent auditor to discuss the state of control during the financial year 2007.
The Court's extermination In its opinion of 2007 (OJ C 318, 12.12.2008), the Court's independent auditor presented the following conclusions: In respect of the annual accounts: In our view, the annual accounts provide a true and fair view of the financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2007, the financial situation and the cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Council Regulation and the accounting rules of the European Court of Auditors. In respect of the use of resources and control procedures, the situation in which, in all relevant respects and taking account of the above: (a) the resources allocated to the Court have not been used for the purposes provided for; and (b) the control procedures introduced do not guarantee that financial transactions have been carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

4 SUBMISSION OF THE PRESIDENT 4 Welcome to the 2009 annual report on the activities of the European Court of Auditors.
The purpose of this report is to provide readers with a review of the main results and progress achieved by the Court this year and to inform them of significant changes in the control and internal organisation environment.
2009 was an important year of renewal for the EU, which was the result of the election of the new European Parliament, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the start of the process of the election of the new European Commission.
The new Treaty reaffirms the role and mission of the Court and its status as EU institutions and introduces changes in the management and control of EU funds, strengthening the role of the European Parliament and stressing the responsibility of the Member States for the implementation of the budget.
The Court expects these changes to provide an opportunity to improve the EU's financial management.

This year we have made significant progress in implementing our control strategy for 2009-2012 and in achieving our objectives We have strengthened our work effectiveness and We have made significant use of our resources this year.
An important step was our decision to present to the Council of the European Union a new regulation to be approved in order to improve our procedures for the adoption of reports and opinions.
In addition, the Court's reports increased from 42 in 2008 to 57 in 2009.
I am also pleased to say that our main product, our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget, has once again met with positive acceptance among our main institutional addressees, who have agreed with many of our recommendations.
In 2009, the Court continued its active cooperation with the Supreme Audit Authorities of the Member States (ORKB) to develop common approaches to the control of EU funds and to consider how the CRKB can help governments deal with the financial and economic crisis.
The Court's results depend on the competence and motivation of 880 employees.
Their satisfaction is a key factor in the success of the Court and is set out in this report for the first time.
I would like to thank the Court's staff for their tirelessness and commitment to the work to enable the Court to carry out its tasks.

8 THE COURT'S ROLE AND WORK 8 THE COURT'S POSITION IS THE EU BUDGET The European Union's budget in 2010 is around EUR 123 billion, representing around 1% of the gross national income (GNI) of the 27 Member States.
However, for some Member States EU funds play an important role in the financing of public actions and, compared with the GNI of several Member States, the overall budget is significant.
The revenue of the European Union consists mainly of contributions from Member States from their gross national income (GNI 76%), from customs duties and agricultural duties (so-called traditional own resources. 12%) and VAT (VAT 11%) collected by Member States.
BOX 1 FOR WHAT IS THE EU GOING TO EXPECT THE EU'S HIS WAYS?
The EU budget is financed by contributions from Member States (mainly based on national GNI), customs and agricultural duties and VAT contributions.
The EU budget is largely used for purposes other than the national budget, partly due to differences in competence.
European Union citizenship, freedom, security and justice 1.1% Conservation and management of natural resources (mainly agriculture) 47.3% The largest area of EU spending is agriculture and rural development, mainly in the form of payments to farmers, which accounts for almost half of the budget expenditure.
Another major contribution to cohesion actions in the field of regional and social development in the field of co-financing a wide range of projects, ranging from road construction projects in Latvia to unemployment training in the Netherlands.
This area accounts for about one third of the budget expenditure.
The European Union as a global partner EU expenditure Source: The European Union's general budget for the financial year 2010. Management of 6.4% of 6.3% of sustainable growth (mainly cohesion) 38.8%
The budget shall be fixed annually by the Council, i.e. representatives of the Member States, and by the European Parliament directly elected, on the basis of the seven-year financial framework.
The European Commission shall draw up the budget and shall be responsible for its implementation.
Most of the budget, in particular in the field of agricultural and cohesion policy expenditure, together with Member States.
A specific feature of Community expenditure is the high percentage of payments which are based on applications of the beneficiaries themselves, whether farmers or project managers, across the Union 9.
10 WHEN DOES THE COURT HAVE THE ROLE?
Democratic society needs reliable, publicly available information, which will form the basis for discussion and decision-making, both in order to improve financial management and to ensure accountability.
The European Court of Auditors shall act as an external EU auditor, ensuring that EU funds, regardless of where they are used, are correctly booked and spent in accordance with the relevant provisions and with due regard to the requirement to make optimal use of the funds.
The Court's audit work is used by the Commission, Parliament and Council and by the Member States to improve the EU's financial management.
In addition to the Court's activities, many national audit authorities examine EU funds, provided that they are managed and issued by public authorities in the Member States.

Is financial management in line with the principles of sound financial management, i.e. have the resources been kept to a minimum (savings) or have the results been achieved with the lowest possible use of resources (efficiency) and have the objectives (efficiency) been achieved?
The Court publishes the results of its audit work in the following types of reports: the annual reports on the results of the audit of financial statements in the form of a statement of assurance on the implementation of the general budget2 and the activities carried out under the European Development Fund3.

2 According to the TFEU, the Court is required to issue such a statement or audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The annual statement of assurance is commonly known under the acronym DAS (e.g. Déclaration d.Assurance.)
12 HOW DO THE COURT TAKE CARE OF THE CARRYING OF THE CARRYING OF THE CARRYING OF THE CARRYING OF THE CARRYING?
The Court carries out an audit of the EU's annual accounts in accordance with the international audit rules that apply both in the public and private sectors.
However, the existing international control rules do not include the Court's conformity check.
The Court actively participates in the development of international audit rules promoted by standardised organisations (INTOSAI, IFAC) 4.
In order to ensure that payments are compatible with the legal framework and other legal frameworks, the Court is based on the results of the analysis of both the supervisory and control systems to prevent and detect and correct errors of legality and regularity and on the sample of individual transactions (payments) (see Box 2).
Other sources, such as statements by the management of the audited bodies in the form of annual activity reports of the Directors-General of the Commission and the work of other auditors, shall also be used to support the Court's conclusions.
In the case of performance control, the Court uses a number of control methods to assess management and monitoring systems and to assess performance on the basis of regulatory criteria and taking into account the principles of sound financial management.
With regard to the selection of topics for performance control, the Court seeks to identify the areas of control for which it can be expected that it will be most likely to improve the most visible improvements in terms of savings, efficiency and effectiveness of EU spending.
3 The European Development Fund (EDF) is based both on international agreements concluded between the Community and its Member States and on certain African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and on Council decisions on the association of the overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
The Commission manages most of the expenditure related to ACP countries, partly through the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (see external relations, development and enlargement) and partly through delegations in beneficiary countries.

BOX 2 WEEKS OF EU BUDGET PAYMENTS BY THE COURT 13 The Court does not have the resources necessary to examine in detail all operations relating to the EU budget.
Therefore, it uses statistical sampling techniques to present the results representative of the population concerned.
The Court monitors these operations up to the final beneficiary of the grant, for example the project promoter in Italy.
The Court then examined on the spot on several occasions whether the proposal was compatible with the reality.
Where the sample is representative, the results may be calculated for the population, i.e. for a specific area of revenue or expenditure, and may be used as a basis for the general assessment, together with the information resulting from the assessment of management and control systems and other sources.

14 TASKS AND TASKS5 14 STRUCTURAL STRUCTURAL AND ORGANISATION The Court of Auditors acts as a collegial body comprising 27 members, each of which consists of one member per Member State.
Members shall elect a President from among themselves for a period of three years, with the possibility of re-election.
The five audit groups to which individual members of the Court are assigned shall prepare reports and opinions for adoption by the Court.
As the organisational chart shows, there are four thematic audit groups covering different budgetary areas, as well as another audit group dealing with horizontal issues.
In addition, the Management Committee, composed of the members of the Court, shall be responsible for preparing the Court's administrative decisions.
At the end of 2009, the Court submitted to the Council a proposal to amend the Rules of Procedure in order to allow the adoption of certain categories of Court opinions and reports instead of the entire College of Chambers.
These changes will improve and improve the Court's decision-making process, including by reducing the time needed for the adoption of the decision.
Each Chamber has two areas of competence: the first field includes the adoption of special reports, special annual reports and opinions, the second - the preparation of draft comments on the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund, and draft opinions to be adopted by the College.
As in the case of the Court, decisions shall be taken by a majority of the Members of the Chamber.
Members may attend meetings of all chambers but shall have the right to vote only in the Chamber to which they have been assigned by the Court.
Of course, the entire college continues to meet to discuss and adopt the documents for which the Court is responsible, such as the annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund.
The role of the Management Committee will be strengthened.
The Committee shall consist of the President of the Court holding the Presidency and the President of the Chambers.
The Committee shall prepare administrative matters requiring decisions of the Court and decisions on procedures, rules or strategic matters before they are submitted to the Court for approval.
The member shall then report to the audit group and to the Court and submit it to the European Parliament, the Council and the other interested parties following the adoption of the report.
For more details, see the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu).
THE COURT'S STAFF FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2009 provides for 880 posts for the European Court of Auditors (at 31 December 2009).
The task of the Court's staff working in the field of audit shall be to plan and carry out audits and to prepare draft reports in connection with them.
Auditors work in different groups: for certain specific audits, the panel shall consist of four or five auditors, while for some of the broader audits of the Court (e.g. accounting audits/compliance checks on agricultural expenditure and consistency in order to produce an annual statement of assurance) at least 20 auditors shall participate.
In general, auditors must obtain evidence of checks under various procedures: documentary checks in Luxembourg, visits to the European Commission, visits to the place and place in the Member States where revenue is generated from the EU budget and where actions financed from the EU budget are carried out.
The Court's reports and opinions must be accessible to readers throughout the Union and throughout the Union, during the audit work, the Court must maintain contacts with authorities and other bodies throughout the Union.
This would not be possible without the Court's interpreters who translate its reports and opinions (in almost all cases drawn up in English or French) into 22 official languages of the Union.
They shall also translate correspondence between the Court and other bodies, as appropriate, and, in certain cases, assist in carrying out inspection visits in the Member States.
The Court's administrative staff shall be responsible for a number of supporting tasks carried out in international organisations operating in the EU context.
This applies to finance, accounting, budget, buildings, information technology, transport, security, etc. The Secretary-General is the Court's senior staff and is responsible for the management of human resources and the management of the Court. 15

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET: Six SOURCE BUDGETS • The annual accounts of the European Union provide a true and fair picture of the financial situation and the results. • With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, the overall results for 2008 reflect improvements in financial management in recent years. • The overall progress achieved in 2008 is mainly the result of better results in the greatest extent, in agriculture and natural resources.
In the field of rural development, the estimated error rate is lower than in previous years, but is still significant.
For the first time, the Court does not give a negative opinion on agriculture and natural resources as a whole. • The second largest thematic area, almost a third of the budget, as the most vulnerable budget area remains problematic.
The Court estimates that at least 11% of the total amount of the refund should not have been paid. • The Court's recommendations on the improvement of supervisory and control systems in the past remain in force.
They should be considered as part of an ongoing process in which these actions can be considered effective only after a certain period of time. • In addition, particular attention should be paid to those areas of expenditure in which the Court continues to face a high level of error.
In many cases, errors are the result of excessively complex rules and regulations.
Simplification therefore remains a priority objective 19.
20 The Court's unlimited opinion on the reliability of the accounts concluded that, in all material respects, the annual accounts of the European Communities for 2008 provide a true and reliable picture of the financial situation of the European Communities and of the results of their operations and cash flows.
The Court issued unlimited audit opinions on income, commitments in all thematic groups, payments in thematic groups, education, citizenship and administrative and other expenditure in 2008.
Limited control opinions on Payments under the thematic area Agriculture and natural resources and with the exception of the rural development area were legal and correct in all relevant respects.
Payments within the Thematic Group on Economics and Finance under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6) were legal and correct in all relevant respects.
Among the topics: the topics: the areas: the areas: the areas: the areas: the areas: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: the countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: among countries: countries: countries: among countries: among countries: countries: among countries: countries: countries: among countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries: countries, countries, countries: countries: countries, countries: countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries: countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries, countries
Payments in these problematic groups involved significant errors, although to varying degrees.
The need to improve supervisory and control systems Surveillance and control systems in thematic groups in the field of research, energy and transport in the field of external aid, development and enlargement in the field of education and citizenship in the field of prevention, detection and correction of excessive or ineligible costs has been partially effective.
In the case of the policy group Agriculture and natural resources and Agriculture and natural resources, the Court also concluded that the supervisory and control systems are partially effective.
However, he stressed that the integrated management and control system (IACS) remains, in principle, an effective control system.
However, improvements are needed in certain areas, in particular rural development areas where shortcomings have occurred.
The use of these methods is subject to the following criteria: the use of these methods is subject to the use of these methods: the use of these methods is subject to the use of these criteria: the use of these methods is subject to the use of these criteria: the use of these criteria is subject to the use of the following criteria: the use of these criteria is subject to the use of these criteria: the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria is subject to the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria is subject to the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria is subject to the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria is subject to the use of these criteria; the use of these criteria is in use of these criteria.
In the third area, in the area of the WS, these systems, mainly due to the irregularities related to FP6, were considered to be partially effective.
In the case of the thematic group, the Court found that, in most cases, Member States' systems aimed at correcting the errors found during national audits were at least partially effective.
The Commission, the Member States and the other beneficiary countries must make further efforts to implement the necessary improvements in the above mentioned areas to ensure that the risk of irregular expenditure is adequately controlled.
BOX 3 3 ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION 21 The auditor may issue the following opinions: • unlimited audit opinion if it is proven that accounting is reliable or the underlying transactions, i.e. payments, are legal and correct in all material respects; • negative audit opinion if the level of error in the underlying transactions is material and comprehensive or if it is not reliable; • refusal to issue audit opinions if the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient and sufficient evidence to support the opinion of the audit and it is possible both material and comprehensive; the limited audit opinion if it is not possible to deliver an opinion from an unlimited audit, but it is not so important or limited that it requires a negative audit opinion or the opinion of the audit.
22 BOX 4 WEEKS OF TRUTH AND TRUTH OF WEEKS BY EXPENDITURE The following table summarises the overall assessment of supervisory and control systems, in accordance with the relevant chapters of the 2008 Annual Report, and provides an overview of the results of the audits of representative samples of transactions carried out by the Court.
The table provides key information but not all relevant information (in particular information on the shortcomings of the supervisory and control systems and the types of errors) presented in the main part of the report.
ASSESSMENT OF KEY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM Revenues Agriculture and natural resources: EUR 55 billion Cohesion: EUR 36.6 billion Research, energy and transport: EUR 7.5 billion External assistance, development and enlargement: EUR 6.2 billion Education and citizenship: EUR 1.7 billion Economics and finance: EUR 0.6 billion Administrative and other expenditure: EUR 8.5 billion Assessment of supervisory and control systems Uneffective scope of estimated level of FQ > 5 %2 % ≤ FQ ≤ 5 % FQ < 2 % (below error level (FQ) materiality level)
For the EDF, the Court concluded that, in all material respects, the EDF accounts for 2008 provide a true and fair view of the financial situation of the EDF.
With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, the Court issued an opinion without reservation on the revenue and liabilities of the EDF.
The Court also found that there were significant errors in EDF payments.
The Court considered EDF supervisory and control systems to be partially effective.
In addition, a further 37 special annual reports on agencies and other decentralised bodies of the European Union for the financial year 2008 were adopted in 2009.
The Union agencies shall carry out various tasks in different places within the Union.
Each agency shall have a specific task and shall manage its own budget.
The audits of the agencies and other decentralised bodies of the Union shall be the subject of specific annual reports, which shall be published separately.
With the exception of the European Police College, the Court has delivered, for all agencies, full opinions on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions23.
24 SPECIAL REPORTS7 The choice and development of the subject of performance and compliance checks are based on criteria such as the risk of cost-effectiveness of certain revenue and expenditure or compliance with the rules, the volume of expenditure, the date of the last check, the forthcoming changes in the regulatory or operational framework, as well as the political and public interest.
Since performance and compliance checks are complex and require a large number of detailed work, their full implementation usually takes more than a year, from the initial examination to the final report.
In 2009, the Court adopted 18 special reports.
The special reports are available directly on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu) and are referred to in the Official Journal to their publication.
As in previous years, the reports dealt with investigations into financial management in many different areas, including, for example, EU food aid for the most deprived persons (No 6/2009) and management of the Commission's financial resources (No 5/2009).
In 2009, alongside 18 special reports, the Court examined the use of EU funds to transfer Chernobyl location to a environmentally sound state.
Recommendations for improving the management of EU funds by the EBRD were forwarded to the President of the Commission by a letter from the President of the Court (not published).
The special reports adopted by the Court in 2009 are presented below by subject matter.
In order to illustrate the nature of the issues in question and the lessons learned, a concise report was presented on each of the thematic issues.
Special reports are available on the Court's website or are available on the Court's website or via the electronic procurement form via EU Bookshop.

He concluded that the development and validation phase was not properly managed.
If the EGNOS programme (e-stationary navigation service for Europe) and Galileo are to be implemented in mid-2007, the Commission must significantly improve the management of the programme.
The report contains a number of recommendations to facilitate this task for the Commission.
Finally, where the EU decides to join other major infrastructure programmes, the Commission must ensure that its appropriate management instruments are available.

26 Have the management instruments for the market in milk and milk products achieved their main objectives?
The Court has reviewed the functioning of the milk and milk products market since the introduction of milk quotas in 1984 and examined the Commission's approach to managing the gradual deregulation of the dairy sector, which started in 2003.
The situation at the end of 2008 is the basis of the Court's recommendations to the Commission: to prevent new overproduction, to monitor the price-setting process in the food chain, to deepen the reflection on the future of producers in less-favoured areas, and on the impact of geographical concentration of milk production on the environment, to further target milk production to meet the needs of the European internal market and on high-value added milk products that can be exported to the world market without budget support.

The Court examined the European Union Public Health Action Programme 2003-2007.
The Court's audit sought to determine whether the framework conditions for projects financed by the EU budget were defined in a way that effectively complements Member States' efforts to protect and improve public health.
The report shall contain detailed conclusions and recommendations on the development, implementation and management of the programme.
In the light of its findings, the Court questions the benefits of certain elements of the European public health programmes, such as the PHP.
The Commission and the Member States are invited to reconsider the EU approach to public health funding.
EU AS A GENERAL PARTNER EU • No 1/2009 • Banking activities in the Mediterranean under the MEDA programme and previous protocols under the MEDA programme • No 4/2009 in the framework of the Commission's management of non-state actors' participation in development cooperation between the Community • No 12/2009 in the framework of the effective management of Commission projects in the field of justice and home affairs for the Western Balkans • No 15/2009 in the framework of EU assistance through the United Nations organisation for decision-making and control under the Development Assistance Programme for Turkey in the framework of the management of pre-accession assistance for Turkey by the European Commission under the European Commission's programme • No 12/2009 in the framework of the EDF programme for regional economic integration in East Africa and West Africa in West Africa in 27 The European Commission's management of pre-accession assistance for Turkey has examined the management of pre-accession assistance to Turkey by the European Commission.
In particular, the first period of implementation of pre-accession assistance (2002-2006) was characterised by many shortcomings, which have already emerged in previous pre-accession programmes.
The objectives set by the Commission for grants were not specific enough to allow for an impact assessment of the project and the Commission did not have the information necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of pre-accession assistance.
Nevertheless, the projects audited have produced the planned results and the results of the projects are likely to be sustainable.
The Commission has already made some significant improvements, but the Court makes recommendations on further corrective actions.
Among the areas where improvement is most needed is the definition of strategic grant targets, the definition of more realistic deadlines for achieving the objectives and the monitoring of the real results of projects and the results of projects based on clear objectives and relevant indicators.

He concluded that EPSO successfully managed to increase the number of competitions due to the enlargement of the European Union.
However, the following shortcomings are still questionable: the staffing needs of the institution were not reported to EPSO in due time, the selection process took too long, on average only two thirds of the expected number of candidates (listed in the list of candidates) and the management information was not fully reliable or complete as a result of the selection procedures.
COMMENTS Another contribution from the Court to improving the EU's financial management is to issue opinions on proposals or issues relating to financial management.
These opinions are required as part of the procedure for the adoption of financial rules8 or may be issued at the request of one of the other institutions of the Union9.
In 2009, the Court adopted an opinion on the proposal to amend the Regulation of the Committee on Budgets of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market concerning the financial rules of the Office (...) of the Financial Regulation.

29 The Court's audit serves as a direct source of information for decision-makers of the institutions concerned in a European context, in particular for the Commission, the Parliament, the Council and the Member States.
On the basis of this information, they may take action with or without reference to the Court's conclusions of the audit.
Although the Court's audit activities have the greatest impact on the published reports and opinions, this impact is already felt throughout the audit itself.

In the field of cohesion, the Commission is still working on the review of the rules applicable to the period 2007-2013 to simplify the reporting system and committed itself to produce a report at the beginning of 2010 on the actions taken in 2009 and the first impact of the actions taken under the action plan to strengthen the Commission's supervisory function in the management of structural actions (see points 1.53 and 6.36 (a) of the 2007 annual report).
In the field of external policy In order to strengthen control at the level of implementing organisations, the Commission intends to develop a specific instrument to strengthen support for these organisations in the management of EU funds and in compliance with EU rules (see point 8.33 (a) of the 2007 annual report).
In the field of internal policy, including research, the Commission has developed a multiannual control strategy under the Sixth Framework Programme, based on the detection and correction of errors that could not be detected as part of the documentary checks prior to payment.
In order to simplify the procedures of the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission established a guarantee fund for participants, which significantly reduced the number of ex ante controls and safeguard measures to be implemented (see paragraphs 7.43 (b), 10.34 and 2.42 (a) of the 2007 annual report).
Source: Report from the Commission to the European Parliament on the follow-up to the discharge decisions for the financial year 2007.
Special reports shall also be taken into account in the discharge procedure.
As they are published during the year, the presentation of special reports and the debate on the subject were usually held at Parliament and Council meetings at an earlier stage.
The impact of the audit reports can be increased by their involvement in the relevant media, paying more attention and encouraging public debate.
Overall, the media report on the Court's annual report is quite extensive.
This was also the case in 2009, with the media focusing primarily on improving agricultural spending.
The press also followed several special reports with interest.
For example, the special report on the milk market (No 14/2009) which assessed the extent to which the management instruments for the milk and milk products market had achieved their main objectives was the subject of intensive discussions in the Council and in Parliament, and at a time when the sector was confronted with various problems, in the media and in the professional groups concerned, a broad echo in the media.
The Court is working on a further analysis of the impact of its activities.
In 2009, he started working on the process of systematic monitoring of his special reports to identify and document the progress made in addressing the shortcomings identified and in implementing the recommendations made.
This procedure will provide the Court, as will Parliament and other interested parties, with additional feedback on the effects of its activities.
31 OPINION OF THE COURT OF OPINION No 1/2010 OF THE POWER TO THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION: RISKS AND CHALLENGES In February 2010, the Court gave its opinion for the first time on measures to reduce the level of irregular payments at the level of the EU budget and to improve the quality of expenditure (savings, efficiency and effectiveness).
The Court found that in order to increase recent progress in reducing the level of irregular payments, rules in high risk areas should be simplified and control systems should be put in place more cost-effectively.
Such reforms should be carried out in the context of the ongoing broader review of the EU spending system.
The Court considers that improving the quality of expenditure is of great importance, which can be achieved by applying the concept of European added value in the definition of expenditure priorities and by addressing the problems identified by the Court in the selection, design and implementation of expenditure programmes and grant programmes.
OBJECTIVE OF THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HIGHEST PAYS IN THE EU BUDGET, even though the level of irregular payments has fallen, remains high in the thematic groups, taking into account the most important account of the most important payments in the EU budget, even though the level of irregular payments has fallen, remains high in the thematic groups, taking into account the most important aspects, taking into account the most important aspects of the payments, taking into account the most important aspects of the payments in the EU budget, taking into account the most important aspects, of the knowledge, of the knowledge, of the knowledge, of the most important aspects of the payments, of the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of the most important aspects of the payments, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge of, the knowledge, the knowledge, of, of, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, of, of, the knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge, of, the knowledge, of, the knowledge, of, of the knowledge, of, of the knowledge, of, of the knowledge, of, of, of, of the knowledge, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, the knowledge, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of
Most irregularities are based on reporting on ineligible expenditure by beneficiaries, reporting on excessive eligible expenditure and non-compliance with payment conditions, for example on public procurement rules.
These are mainly due to the complexity of payment systems and conditions and to shortcomings in risk control systems at the level of final beneficiaries.
The Commission should address the specific systemic shortcomings identified by the Court in high risk areas and improve its supervision.
However, with an increasing number of controls and, as a result, a decreasing error rate, a point was reached at a certain point where the cost of controls was no longer proportionate to the benefits obtained.
Simplification should therefore remain a priority.
The rules and regulations to be interpreted clearly and easily may not only reduce the risk of error but also reduce the costs of controls 31.
32 IMPROVING THE CONCEPT OF EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES In addition to simplification, the Commission should ensure clear objectives for the review of existing and for the development of new actions.
It is often necessary to increase the sense of reality and to increase transparency and accountability.
To this end, the Commission could further strengthen the existing procedures for the development of future strategies, in particular ex ante evaluation and impact assessments.
Given the European added value in defining expenditure priorities, the Court proposes clarifying the concept of European added value in the relevant political declaration or EU legislation in order to give guidance to EU political bodies in defining expenditure priorities.
The Court considers that the Commission should complete the budget review as soon as possible and take account of its results when drawing up the financial framework starting in 2014.
Improving the quality of expenditure should be of great importance to the institutions of the European Union and thus be the main objective of the new Commission.
33 THE COURT'S WORK PLAN FOR 201010 The Court presents its future audit work in the work programme submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and available to the public on the Court's website.
The work programme shall provide stakeholders with information on new and ongoing audits and on the planned reports.
The Court has developed a control strategy for 2009-2012, which is based on two priority objectives: maximising the overall impact of controls and improving efficiency by making the best use of resources.
These objectives will be essential for the Court's 2010 work programme and for its efforts to continue to improve.
The Court seeks to maximise the overall impact of the checks over a given period by selecting and drawing up checks which focus on the risks and which are of the greatest interest to the Court's addressees; • it continues to present conclusions from the checks and useful conclusions on the improvement of whether these proposals are implemented; • it carries out a broader scope of checks and presents new types of control products that complement the current annual and special reports; • it develops more special reports that are close to time and more user-friendly; • it maintains relations with the main addressees, including the relevant parliamentary committees, as well as with the media and the general public; the Court seeks to improve efficiency by making the best use of resources during that period.
• Better management; • effective and dynamic human resources policy; • rationalisation of control tasks; • improvement of IT tools; • improvement of expertise; • improvement of relations with research bodies.
33 10 A more complete and detailed review of the Court's future work can be found in the Court's 2010 work programme, available on its website (www.eca.europa.eu).
34 Under the 2010 Work Programme, the Court has selected specific audit priorities, including: • the multi-annual nature of a significant proportion of Community expenditure, including lump sums and recovery; • innovation and the internal market; • human capital; • sustainable energy; • the Commission's strategy to simplify the legal framework for businesses and citizens.
On 1 July 2009 in Luxembourg on 1 July 2009 a new building was built on 1 July 2009 and a second building was built by the European Court of Auditors.
Vítor Caldeira, President of the European Court of Auditors, Claude Wisler, Luxembourg's Minister for Construction, Patrick Gille, the President of the Vietnamese and Kirchberg Fund, and Eduardo Ruiz García, the General Secretary of the Court, bearing the symbolic first shovel, signaled the start of construction work.
This extension of the European Court of Auditors' building complex of already two buildings will allow staff to be accommodated during the successive enlargements of the Union.
In 2009-2012, the Court will seek to broaden the scope of the audit reports.
To this end, it will coordinate with its main external addressees to ensure that it is able to clearly understand their different needs and to best meet their expectations as part of the implementation of the mandate under the Treaty.

This requires, for each financial year, the examination and control of accounts and operations within the EU general budget.
European development funds and each of the 40 European agencies and bodies are the subject of separate certificates of assurance.
Audit work shall cover the period from June of year n to June of year n+1 so that annual reports can be published in accordance with the Financial Regulation in November of year n+1.
A statement of assurance for the financial year 2009 will be drawn up and published in 2010, and at the same time the statement of assurance for the financial year 201011 will begin.
The Court's work aims to make clear proposals on the state of financial and financial management in the various areas of the general budget and to make appropriate and cost-effective recommendations, to the extent possible, to the extent possible.
The Court's annual report on the general budget for the financial year 2009 will continue to be in line with the structure introduced in 2007 and taking into account the reallocation of the budget12.
The arrangements are presented under chapters relating to related policy groups (thematic divisions), but this structure is largely not in line with the chapters of the new financial framework.
Moreover, the Court will seek to present clearer and more coherent results and conclusions to make them clearer and clearer and easier to compare within and between the groups, and between them and between the financial years.
35 11 For more information on the DAS approach, see the Court's website: www.eca.europa.eu.
12 The Court has set up a DAS tank to reconsider the various aspects of the DAS approach and in this context to reconsider the different aspects of the evaluation.
36 MEASURING AND IMPROVING THE CERTIFICATE OF CERTIFICATES IN 2008 The Court decided to introduce a system of key performance indicators (CL) for its audit and non-audit activities to measure the effectiveness of the Court's strategic objectives and the objectives set out in the annual work programmes.
CLI aims to increase internal and external responsibility and to increase productivity and quality of work. INTERMEDIARY IndicatorS • To inform management of how effectively the Court carries out its activities as an authority; • to support the decision-making process by focusing the institutions' attention on performance issues and by supporting improvements; • to inform the group of addressees of the relevant issues related to the Court's performance.
The main concerns of the CLI are the achievement of the Court's strategic objectives, as they concern the quality of the Court's audits, results, impact and management of the Court's resources.
They form an integral part of the Court's management system.
The quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the main users of the Court's reports of ZLI 2 Evaluation of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audit body ZLI 3 Evaluation of the content and presentation of the Court's reports by a team of external experts ZLI 4 Percent of the audit recommendations adopted by the audit body b) Evaluation of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audit body ZLI 5 Number of reports adopted in relation to the number of ZLI 6 reports planned Number of reports adopted by ZLI 7 Percent of the audit reports ZLI 8 External assessment of the Court's financial management: a) Evaluation of the independent auditor b) Decision of the discharge authority ZLI 9 Level of satisfaction of the Court's staff ZLI 10 The average number of training days per number and quality of the audit work can also be improved when assessing the impact of the Court's reports and opinions on financial management.
The four key performance indicators (from 1 to 4) measure the impact of the Court's work.
They were included in the Court's annual work programme for 2010.
38 The number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned The Court adopted 91% of the reports planned in 2009.
The annual report and all specific annual reports were adopted as planned.
Of the 24 planned special reports, only 18.
The remaining six special reports were still in the final phase on 31 December 2009.
The number of reports adopted in 2009 The Court adopted 67 % of the reports within the deadline.
The annual report and all specific annual reports were adopted in due time.
Due to delays in drawing up special reports, the Court has not achieved the objective of CLI 6. Further efforts should be made to improve compliance with the time limits for the adoption of special reports.
The Court shall forward the preliminary results of the audit to the audit authority in the audit notice.
It seeks to increase the proportion of the notifications of checks submitted in good time by 10% per year and the long-term objective is to draw up 80% of the notifications of checks within the time limit set (two months after the final verification visit).
In 2009, the number of notifications of checks made in time increased by 16 % compared to 2008.
External evaluation of the Court's financial management: (a) the opinion of the independent auditor; (b) the decision of the discharge authority The independent auditor of the Court has delivered an opinion on the annual accounts and the use of resources; the European Parliament has given discharge on the basis of a positive recommendation from the Council.
The level of satisfaction of the Court's staff In the internal interview on the satisfaction of the Court's staff in 2009, 86% of the Court's staff were generally satisfied with their work (an 80% target), while the overall level of satisfaction of the Court's staff was 2.8 on a scale of 4 (an objective of 2.5).
The Court seeks to provide auditors with an average of 40 hours (five days) of vocational training according to guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
In 2009, the average was four days.
39 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The Court has actively and fully continued international cooperation within the following bodies: • within the Contact Committee, composed of the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Authorities of the EU Member States and the Court, • within the network of the Supreme Audit Authorities of the applicant countries, • within the European Supreme Audit Authorities Organisation (EUROSAI) and • within the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).
The Court has contributed to the annual meetings of these organisations and to the improvement of international control rules and procedures and has actively participated in the committees and working groups set up by these organisations.

40 STAFF AND SUPPORT SERVICES The Court's most important capital is its staff.
At 31 December 2009, the Court's staff was 880 staff (officials and temporary staff but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
Of the 525 staff (including 115 staff in the members' office) the audit tasks were dealt with; 163 as translators; 171 as administrative assistants; and 21 as assistants to the president.
The Court's staff have a broad academic and professional context and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's results.
ENLARGEMENT OF THE COURT'S PLANS TO 31 DECEMBER (busy and vacant) Translation Administrative support The Court has committed itself to achieving its strategic objective of improving its efficiency by making the best use of its resources.
In 2009, he continued to analyse and exploit the potential for productivity growth in all his activities, simplifying procedures and improving services.
In particular, the resources of the support services, which have been made available through efficiency gains, have been removed as far as possible from these services and made available for audit tasks.
This process is not yet completed and its effects will be even more visible in 2010.
As regards staff, the Court identified as the main performance indicator (ZLI 9) the assessment of the level of satisfaction of the Court's staff (see page 37).
To this end, a satisfaction study was carried out to provide information on this subject and to support the decision-making process in this area.
The Court is currently implementing measures to ensure that the opportunities to achieve better results in the coming years are fully exploited.

Like the other European institutions, the Court is pursuing a policy of equal opportunities for human resources management and recruitment, recognising the need for a more active promotion of equal treatment between men and women in recruitment at higher levels of management.
17 of the 64 directors and heads of departments and departments (26.5 %) are women, which means a small increase in the percentage of women since 2008 (24%).
Most of them, however, work in the Translation Directorate and in the administrative departments.
The increase in the number of women in the functional group AD reflects the results of the last wave of recruitment.
43% of staff in grade AD5-AD8 are women.

TERMINATION The Court's employment policy complies with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and the Court's staff are composed of both officials and contract staff.
The general procedures for the selection of posts at the Court are organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In addition, the Court provides a limited number of traineeships for university graduates for a period of between three and five months.
In 2009, the Court had 112 employees: 69 officials, 14 temporary staff and 29 contract staff.
Recruitment depends on whether the reserve lists are available and whether they are sufficient.
In 2009, the Court managed to employ an adequate number of new workers.
73 jobs that were not filled on 31 December 2009 were reduced by 33% to 49 by 26 January 2010 and the number of job vacancies in the coming months will continue to be significantly lower as the recent wave of recruitment will bring other workers to work.
At 31 December 2008, 68 posts were not planted.
The list of recruitment reserves based on the EPSO selection procedure AD/126/08 was published in August and the first candidates who took part in the competition were called in early November, which was only three months later.
BORROWING EDUCATION The profession of examiner requires continuous training.
Moreover, due to the specific nature of the Court's audit environment, auditors need good knowledge of foreign languages.
In 2009, the Court's staff completed an average of nine days of vocational training.
Language courses accounted for 64% of the total number of training days in 2009 (compared with 48% in 2008).
In 2009, without taking into account language courses, the auditors completed four days of vocational training (see ZLI 10 on page 38).
This figure is expected to increase in 2010 as new staff will have to undergo a compulsory training programme.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, by means of implementing acts, adopt implementing acts, by means of implementing acts, by means of implementing acts, implementing acts or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts adopted by the Commission or by means of implementing acts, or by means of implementing acts adopted pursuant to the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council pursuant to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted pursuant to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 or pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the Council or of the Council pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 966/2012 of Regulation (EU) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the European Parliament and of the Council, and of the Council of the Council on the Council on the Council on the Council, on the Council and of Regulation, the Council and on the European Parliament and of the European Parliament and of the Council, by Regulation, on the Council and of Regulation, on the Council, and on the Council, on the Council, on the Council and on the Commission, on the Council, on the Council, on the Council and on the Council, on the Council, on the Council and on the Council and on the Commission, on the Commission, and on the Council, on the Council, on the Council, on the Commission, by way of Regulation and on the Council Regulation of Regulation of Regulation of Regulation and on the Council Regulation and on the Council Regulation and of Regulation (EU, on the Commission, on the Council Regulation (EU, on the Council Regulation of Regulation (EU, on the Council, and on the Council Regulation (EU, on the Council, on the Council and on the Council, on the Council and on the Commission, on the Council, on the Council, and on the Council and on the Council, and on the Commission and on the Council, on the Council, on the Council and on the Council, and on the Council, on the Council, and on the Council and on the Council and on the Council and on the Council and on
Furthermore, cooperation with other interinstitutional institutions and institutions, such as the European Administrative School, has been successfully continued.
Box 5 presents the Court's audit staff with a portrait to present to the reader a picture of the work carried out and the persons involved in the work 43.
BOX 5 WEEKS WEEKS OF KNOWLEDGE IN BALKEN IN WESTERN BALKEN The Western Balkans were characterised by violence in the past.
The European Union's interest in this region is to promote security and long-term stability.
The rule of law, border security and the fight against corruption are a fundamental condition for EU accession and are a huge challenge in the Western Balkans.
The European Commission is the main donor of funding in the region.
The Court's 2009 report on the effectiveness of the Commission's projects in the area of justice and home affairs for the Western Balkans (Special Report No 12/2009) has shown the situation in this particularly important area.
The audit concerned both investment projects and institutional development projects in four areas: asylum, integrated border management, judiciary and police.
33 Completed projects have been evaluated on the spot, including the asylum centre, the prison in Albania and the court responsible for human rights and war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Several border crossing points have also been visited in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, funded by EU funds, in order to assess whether EU action has led to improvements in the situation.
The study team worked closely with the rapporteur member, Maarten B. Engwirt.
The head of the control department was Raija Peltonen and Ossi Louko, and the head of the team was Jussi Bright.
Enrico Grassi and Miroslav Matej were involved, and Horst Fischer and Jan Pieter Lingen from Maarten B. Engwird also played an important role.
From left to right: Ms Raija PELTONEN, Head of Unit; Mr Jan Pieter LINGEN, Head of Cabinet; Mr Horst FISCHER, Cabinet-Attaché; Mr Jussi BRIGHT, Head of Financial Unit; Mr Maarten B.

Translation Translation is an important action to support the audit, which enables the Court to carry out its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2009, total translation volumes increased by 5.2% compared to 2008.
The share of translation services provided within the prescribed time limit exceeded 95%.
Language support for auditors for inspection visits and for reporting has been strengthened.
The Translation Directorate also supported the INTOSAI Working Groups and related to other specific needs related to the Court's audit activities.
In January 2010, a new IT application (artemis) was introduced to improve the efficiency of translation management.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology provides controllers with basic tools and services.
The main changes in 2009 were the following: • simplifying the processes and continuing the transition to a paper office through the use of automated electronic permits and forms, the introduction of electronic signatures and the start of work on the creation of a database of archives; • enhancing the security of the Court's IT infrastructure by setting up a data recovery centre and archiving the advanced version of the lotos-notes platform, the database and the Court's control and archiving systems; • adopting a long-term IT plan for the period 2010-2012 in order to adapt IT technologies to the main strategic objectives of the Court's audit and continuing efforts to provide high-quality services. 45
46 MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE The Directorate for Finance and Support Services....is responsible for administrative services and infrastructure.
This includes internal controls and accounting controls and administrative and logistical services.
In 2009, the Directorate focused on the reorganisation of its services in order to increase the efficiency and efficiency of and the release of personnel for relocation to the control services.
This reorganisation has led to a reduction in the number of units of the Directorates (from five to three) and to the transfer of several posts to the control services.
An important activity of the management was the construction of a new yard building (building K3).
In 2009 the project manager was appointed after the invitation to tender.
Construction works will start in March 2010 and will be completed in 2013.
The time frame and costs set for the project shall continue to be respected.
CONTROL During the Court's audit work, auditors must travel to the Member States and to other countries benefiting from EU funds to obtain appropriate evidence.
Visits are usually carried out by central and local authorities involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds, as well as by final beneficiaries.
The team of controllers shall normally consist of two or three controllers and the duration of the examination trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and the distance.
In the EU, controls are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities in the visited Member State, which provide useful logistical and practical support.
The following chart shows the number of Court audit visits in the EU Member States in 2009 (300).
In addition, 36 inspection visits were carried out outside the Union in 2009.

In 2009, the overall level of implementation of the available budget was over 92%.
For Title 1 (Members and staff of the institution), this indicator is 88%, with the lowest in Chapter 14 (Other staff and external services) (82%), mainly due to lack or lack of employment and savings.
For Title 2 (buildings, furniture, equipment and various operating expenses), the average execution rate is almost 100%.
The amount of payments under Chapter 20 (buildings) depends on the work of building the second enlargement of the Court (building K3).
The first tranche of funding for this project, amounting to EUR 55 million, was approved for the 2009 budget, which was taken up and partly paid in 2009.
The remaining appropriations for building K3 have been carried over to 2010 and are intended to cover the costs associated with contracts with construction companies concluded by the project manager on behalf of the Court.
This appropriation will be used in line with the proposal submitted by the Court to the European Parliament and the Council at the end of 2008.

The 2010 budget of the Court of Justice for 2010 is around 0.1% of the EU general budget or 1.87% of the administrative budget of the EU institutions and bodies.
The table below shows the breakdown of appropriations by budget heading.
In 2010, about 76% of the total budget comes from human resources.
The 2010 budget fell by 21% compared to 2009, mainly due to a reduction in the budget allocated to the new Court building (K3).
The total cost of building K3 is estimated at EUR 79 million to be financed over the next four years: EUR 55 million in 2009, EUR 11 million in 2010, EUR 7 million in 2011 and EUR 6 million in 2012.

50 SERVICE REVISION The internal audit agency of the Court aims to support the Court in the achievement of its objectives through a systematic and methodological assessment of risk management, internal control and administrative procedures.
Furthermore, the Internal Audit Department presents proposals to improve the effectiveness of the Court.

4 PRESENTATION OF THE PRESIDENT Welcome to the reading of the fourth annual report of the European Court of Auditors. This year we have used the opportunity to re-distribute the content into two main sections of the activity::.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... and.................................................................................................... and................................................................................................................................................................................................ and................................................................ and................................................................................................................................ and...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
In 2010, the Court of Auditors had two important opportunities to participate in the debate on the reform of EU financial management.
At the beginning of the year, the Court presented an opinion to the new Commission on the main risks and challenges of improving EU financial management and, at the end of the year, an opinion on the Commission's proposals to amend the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the EU.
In the perspective of 2011, the Court will continue to implement its values and continue to develop the results and results achieved.
We will once again present high-quality, independent and objective reports and opinions that will contribute to improving EU financial management and contribute to greater accountability and transparency and, in particular, will continue to closely monitor the development of the EU's economic governance and will deal with new legislative proposals that will have an impact on the EU's financial management after 2013.
We are planning to publish 45 annual reports, i.e. annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget and the European Development Funds, as well as specific annual reports on agencies, institutions and other bodies.
Special reports provide an important opportunity to provide added value, as they focus on areas where there is an increased risk, and on areas of particular importance to the addressees, in particular as regards the quality of EU spending in different areas, ranging from the financial instruments and the SME guarantee instrument, to projects funded by the EU in the field of electronic administration and the single payment scheme in agriculture.
While implementing the 2009-2012 strategy, the Court hopes that it will be able to make full use of the benefits of recent reforms, including improved decision-making procedures, and that the Court will continue its efforts to recruit appropriate staff, to minimise the number of jobs and to promote the professional development of its staff.
Without the involvement and professionalism of all the Court's staff in 2010, we would not have achieved what we have achieved.
Vítor Manuel da Silva CALDEIRA President 5 7 2010 SUPERVISION FOR OUR ACTIONs on Annual Reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund for the financial year 2009 by 40 Special Annual Reports on the various EU agencies, institutions and other bodies for the financial year 2009 by 14 Special Reports, mainly on the audit of the implementation of the EU budget for an Opinion on the improvement of the financial management of the EU by 5 other opinions on new or revised EU legal acts, including on the proposal to amend the Financial Regulation for participation in international financial control practices and the specialised community, including the development of new standards for the highest audit bodies (ISSAI) on Pilotprojet with coordinated audits on the regularity of agricultural expenditure, with the participation of the highest audit bodies in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.
9 OUR CONTROL REPORTS AND NOTES The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are: o o Annual reports: o Annual reports on the audit of financial statements and on the control of compliance with the rules for each financial year (including special annual reports published separately for the agencies, institutions and other bodies of the European Union); o special reports are reports that can be published at any time during the year, together with the results of selected audits, mainly the control of economic efficiency with a view to assessing savings, economic efficiency and effectiveness in selected areas of EU revenue and expenditure; o opinions on draft legislative acts with financial implications.

However, these data are not fully reliable; the Commission's corrective action data do not allow a reliable comparison with the Court's estimated error rate; the Court's report, on the basis of the recommendations, shows how financial management can be improved by strengthening management systems and simplifying the rules and regulations.
The Court published its annual report on the European Development Funds for 2009 on the European Development Fund (EDF) for 2009 on 9 November 2010 together with its annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for 2009.
In December 2010, the Court published 40 special annual reports on EU agencies, institutions and other bodies for the financial year 20092.
The Court found that the supervisory and control systems are partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments and that in the report the Court recommends improving certain aspects of EDF financial management, including the cost-effectiveness of control of expenditure, the control of annual audits of completed projects and the control of the use and monitoring of budget support.
12 Special reports adopted in 2010 The Court always seeks to achieve the maximum impact and to make the best possible use of the resources allocated to these tasks when selecting and shaping its tasks in the field of performance control and compliance.
The Court takes into account the following factors: • the risks to profitability or compliance with legal standards in the field of income or expenditure; • the level of income or expenditure; • the time elapsed since possible control; • changes in the legal or operational framework; • the political and public interest.
In order to obtain the necessary control evidence, it is necessary to carefully plan and carry out the selected performance and compliance checks and, before the report is published, the Court gives the audited authorities the opportunity to comment on its findings and its replies.
As a result, these checks usually last longer than one year.

In 2010, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: • Effectiveness of support measures in the field of projects in the field of projects under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research (Special Report No 2/2010) under the Special Report No 2/2010 (Special Report No 2/2010) under the Programme for Project Reports for the feasibility of potential future research institutions.
During the audit, the Court examined whether these two measures effectively contributed to the achievement of the infrastructure objectives of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research 2002-2006. • Impact assessments in the EU institutions: do they help in decision-making?
(Special Report No 3/2010) Impact assessments are one of the pillars of Better Regulation policy to improve and simplify EU legislative proposals. The Commission's impact assessments examined whether they effectively supported the decision-making process in the EU institutions and the comments in this report are also relevant in other budgetary areas.
• Does the design and management of mobility actions under the Leonardo da Vinci programme allow for effective results?
(Special Report No 4/2010) of the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme enables vocational education and training organisations to educate students in another European country. Activities are part of an integrated lifelong learning programme in which the Commission and the national agencies, on the basis of an evaluation of the project and management, have examined whether the objectives can be achieved. • Improving transport efficiency in trans-European rail axes: are EU rail infrastructure investments effective?
(Special Report No 8/2010) (see

(Special Report No 9/2010) from the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund over the 2000-2006 programming period, over EUR 4 billion have been allocated to support projects in the field of water supply infrastructure for households, and the Court has examined whether these measures have been effectively used to address a number of needs, such as increasing water availability, increasing geographical coverage, improving the economy of water supply systems and improving the quality of services 15.

In the light of the forthcoming revision of the TEN-T guidelines in 2011, the Court's report was presented at a particularly favourable time. The Court recommended that the Commission: • cooperate with the Member States and the railway authorities to identify where the trans-European corridors are of high demand and, where necessary, increase knowledge and analytical basis; • increase emphasis on the elimination of practical restrictions on international rail transport; • promote and facilitate cooperation between the authorities of the Member States responsible for the railway sector with a view to jointly planning changes and common practical solutions to the problems.

We wanted to explore to what extent the European rail system gradually turns into a network, turning into a network.
There were 10 controllers involved in the on-the-spot work because we had to deal with many different languages. I had a really good time working on this exam.
Since then, I have become a fan of the railroad...., says Andrej Minarovič, a controller, responsible for the work in Germany and Austria.
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
For this purpose, members of the team travelled by freight trains and travelled through the Alps and visited large tunnels.
These visits were a valuable addition to the knowledge gained by the controllers as a result of the review of reports, interviews with railway workers and of ordinary financial analyses.
18 Protection and management of natural resources Due to a budget of EUR 413 billion for 2007-2013, the EU has a wide range of powers and political responsibility for agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment; three quarters of the resources are allocated to agricultural markets and direct payments to farmers; these payments are financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF), the most pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
More than one fifth of expenditure comes from support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second pillar of the CAP.
Agriculture and rural development shall be managed jointly by the Commission and the Member States.
In 2010, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: • Implementation of the Leader approach in rural development (Special Report No 5/2010) Leader is a bottom-up approach based on local rural development partnerships. • The evaluation assessed whether the Leader approach was implemented in such a way as to bring additional benefits compared to the traditional top-down approach, while minimising the risk of sound financial management. • Has the reform of the sugar market achieved its main objectives?
(Special Report No 6/2010) of the 2006 EU has carried out a thorough reform of the sugar sector in order to ensure the competitiveness of the EU sugar industry, stabilise markets and supply and ensure an adequate standard of living for the rural population.
As part of this process, the European Union as a global partner In addition to enlargement, the EU aims to achieve three main objectives in the area of external relations: to achieve stability, security and prosperity in its neighbourhood, the EU and its neighbourhood policy, to actively promote sustainable development at international level (including the EU as a partner for sustainable development, the EU as a partner for sustainable development, the EU as a partner for global governance and strategic and civil security (including the EU as an international partner) (including the EU as an international partner).

Following the Council's approval of the necessary amendments to the Court's Rules of Procedure on 1 June 2010, chambers of the Court's members were set up to adopt special reports, special annual reports and opinions on draft legislative acts, and earlier all of these reports and opinions were adopted by all the Colleges and continue to take place in the case of annual reports on the EU budget and the EDF.
Although most of the Court's reports are now approved by the chambers, the chambers are given the opportunity to refer their documents to the Court for adoption.
All members may attend meetings of chambers to which they do not belong without the right to vote.
Members of the Court
The Court has gradually developed a set of key performance indicators (CL) in order to inform the management of the progress of the 2009-2012 objectives; to support the decision-making process; to provide information on the results among the Court's addressees.
Since a review of all indicators is available for the first time in 2010, this year is the reference year for future progress assessments. The Court is very pleased with the results achieved in 2010 with regard to key performance indicators, in particular with regard to the quality and impact of its work.
More importantly, indicators clearly identify areas where progress is needed and the problems that need to be addressed in order to achieve future productivity growth.
29 The quality and impact of the Court's work shall be assessed by the Court on the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of the assessments carried out by the addressees and by experts and by monitoring its recommendations.
Evaluation of addressees The Court asked the main addressees of its reports (the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets of the Council) and the main bodies audited (mainly European Commission staff) to assess the quality and impact of the annual reports published in 2009 (in relation to the general budget and the EDF) and the special reports.
The evaluation should be based on a five-stage scale (1 in a very bad, 2 in a bad, 3 in a suitable, 4 in a good, 5 in a very good).
2010 A deliberate assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's reports by the main addressee 4.2 ≥4 The assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audited entity The result is that the main addressees of the Court's reports consider them to be good and good on average.
The Court seeks to maintain or improve this level.
Reviews carried out by experts The two external bodies reviewed the content and presentation of the sample of the Court's reports published in 2009 and 2010. The reviews assessed the eight special reports and the annual reports on the general budget and the EDF for both years and assessed the quality of the different aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale at the level...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
2010 Objective 3.0 ≥ 3.7 ≥4 reviews of the content and presentation of the Court's reports by external experts The result is that the auditors consider the quality of the Court's reports to be satisfactory and satisfactory.
The reviews provided valuable information and the recommendations resulting from them will be used to improve the quality of future reports.
30 Follow-up of the recommendations The Court uses its audit experience primarily in the form of recommendations to improve financial management; in order to amend the Court's recommendation, the evaluation bodies must first adopt and subsequently implement the evaluation bodies, and this indicator is based on recommendations published in 2009, i.e. the latest available, annual and special reports.
In 2010, the objective of 90% ≥ 90% of the audit recommendations adopted by the audited body the Court seeks to maintain or even improve this high level of acceptance of the recommendations.
In 2010, the Court established a system for monitoring the implementation of recommendations by the evaluation bodies.
In the coming years, the system will form the basis for a further indicator of the scope of practical implementation of the recommendations and will form the basis for improvement.
Moreover, the Court will provide valuable information to improve the quality of its recommendations and thus to improve their acceptance among the bodies that have been audited.
31 The effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources The Court assesses the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources, depending on the extent to which it is able to report and audit reports in good time, to fulfil its financial management obligations and to ensure the well-being and expertise of its staff.
For the purposes of the publication of the annual reports and the detailed annual reports, the time limits laid down in the law should be respected.
In the case of special reports for which there is no publication date specified in the provisions, the date of their adoption shall be deemed to be the date of their adoption.
2010 The target of the number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned 90 % 100 % of the percentage of the reports adopted at 80 % 100 % Overall, the Court did not achieve the 2010 target.
In 2010, the Court adopted less reports than planned; the results were comparable with the results of last year (91% in 2009). In addition, in 2010 (80% in 2009 compared with 67% compared with 67% in 2009) the percentage of reports adopted by the deadline increased (80% in 2009).
While all annual reports and all special annual reports have been adopted and published in accordance with the timetable, with the exception of one, they have been adopted and published in accordance with the timetable, with the exception of the three special reports.
For the six special reports, the adoption of these reports was delayed until 2011.
The Court seeks to achieve the objectives by introducing further measures by the end of 2012 to improve the management of the procedures for special reports.
2010 The target percentage of audit notifications by 2012 54 % 80 % by 2012 has not yet been achieved at the required level, but significant progress has been made in the last two years (43% in 2009 and 27% in 2008).
The Court will continue to pursue this objective.The Court's external evaluation of financial management seeks to obtain a full opinion from an independent auditor on the annual accounts and the use of resources and from the European Parliament on the basis of a positive Council opinion on discharge.
2010 Objective Yes Yes Unlimited opinion of independent auditor and discharge
Vocational training According to guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Court seeks to provide experts with an average of 40 hours (five days) of vocational training.
2010 The target average number of days of training per person of 5.7 days ≥ 5 days 33 In 2010 the required level was reached, i.e. an improvement compared to 2009 (average of 4 days).
The level of satisfaction of employees In the internal interview on the satisfaction of the employees carried out in 2009 86% of the Court's employees were generally satisfied with their work, with a total of 2.8 employees' satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 4, each of which in excess of 2,5 indicates general satisfaction and the Court seeks to maintain or improve the result if a similar examination is carried out by the end of 2012.
34 CONTROL SUPPORT The success of the Court's audit activities depends to a large extent on the quality of the support provided by its specialised services; these services provide technical and technical knowledge which enables the Court to recruit, maintain and motivate its staff and develop their professional skills; to disseminate the results of the audit in all the official languages of the EU; to make the best use of information technologies; to manage the budget and maintain the infrastructure; to provide audit trips to all the countries in which EU funds are used.

4 PRESENTATION OF THE PRESIDENT Welcome to the reading of the annual report on the European Court of Auditors' activities for 2011.
The economic and financial crisis led to significant changes in the EU's economic governance, which have a significant impact on the future use of public funds.
In this context, the Court published a position paper in May on the impact of the measures taken in response to the financial and economic crisis on accountability, transparency and financial control.
Later that year, the Contact Committee of the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Authorities (ORCB) of the EU Member States and the European Court of Auditors called on EU decision-makers to ensure that the principles of accountability, transparency and financial control of the EU Member States and the European Court of Auditors are properly respected, as far as the use of public funds is concerned.
In particular, the euro area ORKB called for the introduction of the relevant provisions for the public external financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
This led to a decision to set up an audit committee for the Stability Mechanism, to which a member proposed by the Court will join.
Also in 2011, the results of our key performance indicators are encouraging, in particular with regard to the monitoring of recommendations made by our units, as well as to the evaluation of our control activities by the addressees and external experts.
We have managed to increase our performance with regard to the number of audit reports and opinions adopted in 2011, but we have failed to achieve ambitious targets in terms of timely reporting.
Our annual reports now included even more detailed information and a new chapter on results, as well as 42 annual reports and 16 special reports, together with seven opinions and a position paper.
The scope of the audit powers of the institutions in respect of Union revenue and expenditure, in particular in respect of VAT-based own resources in the Member States, was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in November 2011.
Since 2012, we will be able to inform you of the extent to which our recommendations will be implemented in practice.
In addition, our methods of performance control will be peer reviewed in order to further improve the preparation of special reports.
In 2011, we published ethical guidelines to further strengthen the Court's audit management framework and to improve the audit strategies and guidelines of the Court's audit to improve the audit and reporting process.
In addition, we will launch a new hearing on employee satisfaction in 2012.
In the future, in 2012 we will complete the preparation of our strategy for 2013-2017.
Some of the most important challenges are already apparent: the EU regulatory framework will continue to develop and we must continue to ensure that the principles of accountability, transparency and public financial control are properly respected.
The need to ensure a high quality and timely guarantee of the use of EU funds is growing and we need to improve our audits and reports accordingly.
As the EU is constantly changing, we, too, will try to make the best of our audit experience to help policy makers improve financial management.
Strengthening EU financial responsibility is an objective that we have in common with other actors and we will seek to combine our efforts through strategic partnerships.
Finally, like other EU institutions and bodies, we must be able to achieve less in order to make our organisation more effective.
These challenges will depend to a large extent on the efforts of all the Court's staff.
The development of excellence of our employees in our institutions is important for us.
With regard to professionalism, commitment and past performance of our employees, I am convinced that the Court will be able to achieve these future objectives.
Vítor Manuel da Silva CALDEIRA President 5
7 2011 IN OUR ACTIONS on Annual Reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund (EDF) for the financial year 2010 with more detailed information on 42 specific annual reports on the various agencies, decentralised EU institutions and agencies for the financial year 2010 on 16 Special reports on specific budgetary areas or management issues of 7 Opinions on budgetary reforms, such as the modernisation of the public procurement policy and the Commission's legislative proposal on the rules on cohesion expenditure after 2013 on the Document on the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on public responsibility and control in the EU, as well as the role of the Court of UNSER MANAGEMENT to continue to be encouraged by the results of our key performance indicators, in particular as regards the quality and impact of our work on the adoption of ethical guidelines to further strengthen the audit management framework for the review of the Court's control strategy and control guidelines in order to improve the audit and reporting process.
Number of reports and opinions 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Annual reports (general budget of the EU and EDF) 2 2 2 2 2 Special annual reports on EU agencies and decentralised bodies 29 29 37 40 42 Special reports 9 12 18 14 16 Opinions and other statements 9 5 1 6 8 The full version of the reports and opinions is available on the Court's website www.eca.europa.eu in 22 official EU languages.
As a result, the 2010 Annual Report, including the 17th Statement of Assurance (DAS), was published on 10 November 2011.
The annual report 2010 contained some changes to improve clarity and clarity of information.
These include the recasting of thematic groups (and the corresponding annual chapters), of which the Court groups expenditure, the publication of estimated error rates per policy area (see below), the focus on recommendations on improving financial management and the new chapter on results.
The Court first published estimates of errors for both the EU budget as a whole and for the various thematic groups.
The error rate shall be determined by extrapolating the quantifiable errors found in the audited transaction trials.
The Court compares the estimated error rate with the materiality level of 2% to determine whether the error is material, taking into account further evidence that the error is material.
The error rate is not an indicator of fraud, but reflects the Court's estimates of non-compliance with the rules on expenditure.
This includes breaches of public procurement rules, ineligible or miscalculated costs for projects co-financed by the EU, or cases where farmers provide too much information on areas.
The 2010 Annual Report provides the following main information: the 2010 Annual Financial Report presents the financial situation of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows for 2010.
On the other hand, the payments underlying this financial report are largely affected by errors; the estimated error rate in the EU budget as a whole is 3.7%.
The control systems were partly effective in ensuring the regularity of payments in general. The error rate estimated by the Court in the area of cohesion, energy and transport policy (the most defective area of expenditure in the EU) was 7.7% higher than in 2009 and the error rate remained relatively stable in the remaining areas of expenditure in the EU.
In the policy group Agriculture and natural resources, the estimated error rate was 2.3%, i.e. above the materiality threshold.
However, direct payments to farmers did not show any significant errors. o Share of pre-financing did not. not in the EU budget significantly increased.
Accounting rules and supervisory rules have not been properly adapted. o When planning EU spending programmes, the Commission and the Member States should pay more attention to setting SMART targets, i.e. specific, measurable, achievable, proportionate and timely targets, as well as to identifying and reducing risks that may arise in the course of implementation.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND 2010 In its annual report on the European Development Fund (EDF) for the financial year 2010 (published on 10 November 2011), the Court concluded that the financial statements of the EDF for 2010 constitute, in all material respects, the appropriate financial situation of the EDF and the results of its operations and cash flows, in accordance with the Financial Regulation.
EDF revenue is not affected by serious errors.
The EDF's commitments were legal and correct, regardless of the non-quantifiable errors found in the field of public procurement.
However, EDF payments for projects were largely affected by errors, with an estimated error rate of 3.4%.
The error detected concerned non-compliance with eligibility conditions.
The Court has assessed that the control systems established under the EFF ensure, to a limited extent, the regularity of payments in general.
In December 2011, the Court published special annual reports on the 2010 financial year for all 42 agencies, decentralised bodies (e.g. joint undertakings) and other EU bodies (in particular the efficiency of the management of the European Central Bank).
The Court delivered an unqualified opinion for all units audited, with the exception of the European GNSS Agency, as some of the assets were not included in the accounts and the ENIAC Joint Undertaking, as the report on the results was not included in the accounts.
Agencies and decentralised EU bodies were set up by the EU legislator to carry out specific tasks.
Each agency has a mandate, a board, a director, staff and a budget.
Agencies operate in many areas such as safety, health, research, finance, migration and travel.

12 SPECIAL REPORTS ADOPTED IN 2011 In addition to the annual reports, the Court shall publish, during the year, specific reports containing the results of the performance and compliance checks in the budgetary areas or management areas selected by the Court.
In selecting and selecting audit tasks, the Court seeks to achieve the maximum impact and make the best use of its resources.
In selecting the subjects, the Court takes into account the following factors: the risk to profitability or compliance with legal standards in the area of income or expenditure; the level of income or expenditure; the time since the possible prior assessment; the future changes in the legal framework; the political and public interest.
In 2011, the Court adopted 16 special reports on a number of issues, which means an increase compared to the 14 special reports adopted in 2010.
Special reports will be presented in summarised form below, in the corresponding headings in the financial framework of the EU multiannual budget in j. j..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 13 Sustainable growth is geared towards growth and employment and covers two issues: competitiveness includes support for research and technological development, creation of European networks, vocational education and training, promotion of competitiveness in a fully integrated internal market, social agenda and decommissioning of nuclear facilities.
EU expenditure on growth and jobs for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 89.4 billion, i.e. 9.2% of the total budget, of which almost two thirds are R &amp; D. Cohesion for growth and jobs mainly concerns cohesion policy in the form of funds for specific areas of activity, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
The Commission and the Member States shall use the resources under shared management.
The EU budget for cohesion for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 344.4 billion (35.7% of the total EU budget).
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: on the effectiveness of the SME Guarantee Facility (Special Report No 4/2011) in relation to their design and planning and management of related operations and their implementation.
The SME Guarantee Facility (SMEG) is a financial instrument managed on behalf of the European Commission by the European Investment Fund. This instrument provides financial intermediaries with guarantees or guarantees with regard to loans granted to SMEs by financial institutions with a view to increasing the availability of debt financing. on The effectiveness of tourism projects co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (EFERE) co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (Special Report No 6/2011), with regard to the expected results, their sustainability, European added value and the concept of projects.
This audit was based on a wide-ranging study of projects in the new Member States and 26 regions.
In the period 2000-2006 the ERDF allocated €4.6 billion to in-kind investments in tourism projects and projects are selected and managed by managing authorities in the Member States.
14 on The effectiveness of eGovernment projects financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (Special Report No 9/2011) with emphasis on the 2000-2006 programming period and on four Member States: Spain, France, Italy and Poland.
The audit assessed whether the co-financed projects were selected on the basis of the identified needs, whether they were carried out according to the plan and whether they were adequate and sustainable.
This appropriation is intended to cover the support of the information society of EUR 6,7 billion for the development of new safe technologies, the development of infrastructure and the combination of broadband regions.
The audit examined whether procedures and systems ensure that the Commission will consider all relevant matters, that the cases will be dealt with effectively and within the prescribed time limit, and that the Commission will be able to monitor the effects of the State aid control.
The Commission's task is to ensure that State aid granted by Member States is compatible with the internal market of the European Union.
Member States must notify State aid measures to the Commission and obtain the Commission's approval before State aid is granted. to implement EU financial assistance for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia (Special Report No 16/2011) in order to assess whether the measures under the decommissioning programmes have been adapted to the needs of whether they have been implemented in accordance with the plan and whether the liability and management structures have been designed in such a way as to ensure the effective use of EU funds.
Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia have committed themselves to the early closure and subsequent closure of the eight nuclear reactors, which cannot be equipped, in the framework of the accession negotiations.
In view of the exceptional burden, the EU supported three national programmes of €2.9 billion between 1999 and 2013.
The EU has a strong political responsibility in the field of agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for 2007-2013 is EUR 413.1 billion, or 42.3% of the total budget.
Three quarters of the expenditure concern direct payments to farmers and support to the agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EADF) through the most important pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
More than one fifth of expenditure comes from EU support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second pillar of the CAP.
Agriculture and rural development shall be managed jointly by the Commission and the Member States.
SUPERVISION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES in 2011 The Court adopted the following special reports in this field: on the Single Payment Scheme under the common agricultural policy (Special Report No 5/2011) in 2011: under the common agricultural policy (Special Report No on the common agricultural policy) on the single agricultural policy (Special Report No 5/2011) on the agricultural policy (Special Report No 7/2011) (Special Report No 7/2011) (Special Report No 7/2011).
The report shall assess whether the agri-environment policy is designed and supervised in such a way as to bring significant environmental benefits, whether it is adequately supported by the relevant guidelines and the relevant amounts of aid, and whether the management of the agri-environment policy takes into account specific environmental needs.
The aim of agri-environmental policy is to meet the growing social demand for environmental services by encouraging farmers to introduce or maintain production processes compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment.
This area is subject to joint management by the Commission and the Member States. to recover undue payments under the common agricultural policy (special report No 8/2011) to assess the effectiveness of recovery systems for identified claims established and managed by the Member States.
This audit examined whether Member States correctly register and process claims, whether actions taken by Member States to recover identified undue payments were successful, whether Member States were acting properly to recover irrecoverable claims, and whether Commission supervision and supervision were effective.
The European Union spends around EUR 55 billion annually on agriculture and rural development and some of the funds are unduly paid on account of incorrect or incorrect proposals15.
The effectiveness of programmes is linked to the effectiveness of the programmes and is linked to the achievement of the objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme and objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme and objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme and objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme and the objectives of the programme.
The aim of these EU programmes is to encourage children to eat healthy through the consumption of dairy products and fruit and vegetables and to contribute to improving the market conditions of these products.
The EU is currently spending €180 million per year on these two programmes. on Is it possible to develop and manage a system of geographical indications to be effective? (Special Report No 11/2011).
This audit assessed the reliability of the control system, the attractiveness of the system for producers and their reputation for consumers.
The purpose of the Union GI system is to protect the names of products for which there is a link between their characteristics and the geographical area from which they originate.
This programme creates economic opportunities for farmers and food producers and can have a positive impact on the rural economy in the EU regions. on the effectiveness of EU action to adapt fishing capacity of fishing fleets to existing fishing opportunities (Special Report No 12/2011).
The audit examined whether there was a clear framework for reducing fleet capacity and whether specific measures were clearly identified and implemented.
The study was carried out in the Commission and in Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
The objective of the EU Common Fisheries Policy is to promote sustainable fishing by achieving a balance between fish stocks and the fishing fleet in order to avoid overfishing of fish stocks.
Overcapacity of the fishing fleet has been a problem for many years which threatens both the sustainability of fish stocks and the long-term viability of the fishing sector.
The European Fisheries Fund allocates EUR 4.3 billion for the programming period 2007-2013.
17 SUPERVISION FOR THE REVIEW OF 5/2011 THE OPERATIONAL PAYMENT PROGRAMME: SUPERVISION FOR BETTER FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT This cost-effectiveness review concerned sound financial management of payments under the single payment scheme, which is currently applied in 17 of the 27 EU Member States.
The expenditure related to this programme amounted to around €28,8 billion in 2009.
The introduction of the single payment scheme was a key element of the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy in 2003.
The aim of this programme was to encourage farmers to respond better to market demand and to provide income support to farmers.
The reform broke the link between support and production (it was claimed that production was separated from Vietnam production from Vietnam production).
Instead, farmers must have eligible agricultural land and payment entitlements of this kind.
Since 2006, the Court has carried out a number of checks on the procedures laid down by the Commission and the Member States to ensure the accuracy of payment entitlements and the accuracy of payments to farmers.
These checks covered all 17 Member States applying the scheme, the results of which were taken into account in the annual reports for 2006 and 2007 on the implementation of the EU budget.
The Court decided to carry out, on the basis of these results, a performance check, which focused on the following aspects: beneficiaries of the scheme, access to payments on the holding and the definition of eligible areas; the contribution of the scheme to the objectives of income support to farmers and the maintenance of agricultural land in good agricultural and environmental condition; the particular impact of the application of the different models of implementation of the scheme.
Verification visits were carried out in 2009 and 2010 at the Commission, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.
Special Report No 5/2011 states that the single payment scheme has contributed to the two main objectives of the common agricultural policy: farmers were encouraged to respond better to market demand and the incomes of the agricultural sector as a whole were taken into account.
However, in general, the implementation of the scheme has revealed a number of questionable features concerning the definition of beneficiaries of the policy, the nature of eligible parcels and activities, the environmental impact of the scheme, the distribution of aid between Member States and within Member States and the specific impact of the historical and regional model.
18 The Court recommends in the report that the payment of farm payments should be better granted to active farmers and that payments be excluded from the aid of parcels and non-agricultural activities which do not contribute to the efficiency of agricultural holdings or to the maintenance of the ecological value of land.
Furthermore, the Court recommends that the level of the single payment should take account of environmental costs and other externalities, and that the level of the aid be more balanced between farmers.
The calculation of operational payments should be based on current management conditions.
The audit was carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of eight controllers from Chamber I. The audit work provided further information not only on the concept of non-production-related payments but also on the impact of the conversion process from the previous production-related support system on the current system.
According to Sven Kolling's team leader, the examination of the various models and options existing under the single payment scheme to implement the scheme together with national and regional administrative strategies and their impact on the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the premium is a particular challenge.
Verification visits to final beneficiaries and on-the-spot checks on holdings have proved necessary to obtain evidence to support findings and conclusions.
Many of the Court's recommendations are reflected in the Commission's proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy after 2013 (at the time of the preparation of this report in the debate), including the definition of an active farmer and non-agricultural activity in certain areas, in the breakdown of the premium payments per beneficiary, in the reduction of the number of models for the implementation of the single payment scheme and in the better consideration of environmental externalities in the calculation of the single payment.

EU AS A GENERAL PARTNER 19 EU action in the field of external relations focuses on: enlargement, stability, security and prosperity in the neighbourhood, active promotion of sustainable development at international level, supporting global political governance in and ensuring strategic and civil security.
The EU has allocated €55.9 billion for these objectives for the period 2007-2013, i.e. 5.7% of the planned expenditure.
The Commission shall manage expenditure in most cases directly through its central services or delegations.
Some support measures will also be managed jointly with international organisations.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: on the defocusing of the management of external aid from the Commission's central services on its delegations has contributed to better making the aid available?
(Special Report No 1/2011).
The aim of the audit was to analyse the administrative procedures and their impact on the faster delivery and improvement of the quality of the aid and to establish stable financial procedures.
The EU is the largest donor of development aid in the world, with a significant proportion of the aid (EUR 8.4 billion in 2009) being managed by the Commission under its management system, with, as from 2002, its external assistance powers have been transferred to the partner countries under the scheme. The efficiency and effectiveness of the EU contribution to countries affected by conflicts through the United Nations (Special Report No 3/2011), in particular with regard to projects in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan in the period 2006-2008.
EuropeAid has allocated around EUR 4 billion to UN organisations in 2005-2009.
The EU may allocate funds as the sole donor or together with other donors, as a contribution to trust funds, without allocating funds to specific actions or objectives, or as a contribution to the general budget of the UN organisation. on The effectiveness of EU assistance in enhancing Croatia's capacity to manage post-accession funds (Special Report No 14/2011) in order to assess the Commission's planning of assistance and to assess whether the intended results of EU-funded projects have been achieved.
The objective of EU development aid is to assist candidate countries in building administrative capacity in order to prepare them for the management of the greater EU aid to which they will be eligible as Member States.
EU assistance to Croatia has been EUR 150 million per year since 2007.
The European Union budget is financed mainly by own resources and other revenue.

Most of the EU's own resources (70%) come from gross national income-based own resources, which ensure that the budget is always balanced.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: on the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (Special Report No 2/2011) in order to assess the measures taken to implement the recommendations of the Court's previous Special Report No 1/2005 on the subject.
The audit had as its starting point the question whether OLAF had now shifted its focus on its investigative role and whether its investigations were more effective, as the effectiveness of its investigative work had been demonstrated and whether the role of the Supervisory Committee had been clarified.
OLAF's task is to combat fraud and other illegal activities to the detriment of the EU budget.
The Authority is a member of the Commission but is fully independent in the investigation and employs around 500 employees and its annual expenditure is around EUR 50 million.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following special report in this area: on whether the control of the customs procedure 42 can prevent VAT evasion and discover its effects? (Special Report No 13/2011). In this audit, the Court examined whether there was a solid legal framework in place to combat VAT evasion under the customs procedure No 42.
It was checked in Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Austria, Slovenia and Sweden.
Customs procedure 42 is the mechanism used by an EU importer to obtain an exemption from VAT.
This procedure shall apply in the case of the transport of goods imported from outside the EU into another Member State.
In such cases, VAT shall be payable in the Member State of destination.
OPINIONS AND OPINIONS ON THE POSITIONS PRESENTED IN 2011 The Court also contributes to improving the EU's financial management by issuing opinions on proposals for new or revised legislation having financial implications.
These opinions shall be issued at the request of other EU institutions and shall be used by the legislative bodies at the request of the European Parliament and the Council for the purposes of their work.
The Court may also issue documents on its own initiative on other points of view.
In 2011, the Court adopted seven opinions: o 1/2011: Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 215/2008 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the 10th European Development Fund for the European External Action Service for the 2/2011: Financial rules of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking 3/2011: Proposal for a Financial Regulation for the European Schools o4/2011: Commission Green Paper on the modernisation of European public procurement policy o 5/2011: Proposal for a Council Regulation (Euratom) on the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in indirect actions under the framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community and on the dissemination of research results (2012-2013) o6/2011: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (Euratom) No 1073/1999.
The contribution of the EU budget to the Europe 2020 objectives therefore largely depends on the cost-effective, effective and effective use of these resources.
This will also have an impact on the credibility and legitimacy of EU action.
The EU continues to face the challenge of achieving good results at a high level under a system under which the funds will be pre-distributed among the Member States and used as a hidden target.
Effective monitoring and enforcement by the Commission would help Member States to make effective use of these measures.
Opinions are available in all official EU languages on the Court's website www.eca.europa.eu.
22 THE COURT'S INFLUENCES: THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COURT'S COURT'S FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL IN THE EU AND THE COURT'S ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTING AND CRISIS: THE EU'S ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE EU'S ECONOMIC INFUSIONS AND THE EU'S ACCOUNTING OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS'S ACCOUNTING OF THE FINANCIAL AND CRISIS IN THE EU'S ACCOUNTING OF THE EU'S ECONOMIC INFLUENCES AND ACCOUNTING OF THE FINANCIAL NATIONAL AND THE EU'S ECONOMIC CRISIS had serious consequences for the European Union.
In order to deal with the crisis, the EU has taken action to ensure the long-term sustainability of the financial sector, to promote economic recovery and growth, to provide financial assistance to the Member States and to strengthen financial and economic coordination between Member States.
In addition, these measures have a decisive impact on the use of public funds, i.e. taxpayers' money of EU citizens, in the Union.
The changes in the regulatory structure of the Union pose new challenges in terms of accountability, transparency and public financial control.
The Court considers that the implementation of these new measures is in line with the principle that, whenever the use of public funds is concerned, appropriate rules of transparency, public responsibility and public financial control should be laid down.
Therefore, on 19 May 2011, the Court adopted a document on the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on public responsibility and public control in the EU and on the role of the Court.
In that document, the Court stated that, as far as possible, it would include new supervisory authorities, support mechanisms with EU budgetary guarantees and, where possible, within the European Semester in its audits of the Commission's activities within the European Semester.
The Court considers that the agreement establishing the European Stability Mechanism should provide for the form of external public control.
Finally, the Court concludes that, in many cases, the issues of accountability and transparency must be examined by the relevant EU institutions, in particular by the European Parliament and the Council.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORKBs The Court cooperates with other Supreme Audit Authorities (ORKBs) mainly in the following bodies: the ORKB Contact Committee of the EU Member States; the ORKB Network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; international bodies for the control of public finances, in particular the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their European regional group (EUROSAI).
The CONTACT COMMITTEE The Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies, in accordance with the EU Treaty, cooperate with full confidence in respect of their independence.
The Court is actively working with the CCCs of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee.
The Contact Committee shall meet once a year for EU-ORKB and Court Presidents.
The Contact Committee shall provide a forum for cooperation and exchange of expertise and experience in the control of EU funds and other EU issues.
Working groups have been set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2011, the Court was the President of the Contact Committee, continued to provide administrative assistance and actively participated in various working groups and networks.
The 2011 Annual Contact Committee meeting was held at the Court's premises on 13 and 14 October 2011.
The meeting focused on a seminar on the impact of the European Semester and other recent developments in the EU's economic governance on the EU-ORKB and the Court.
In this context, the issues of regulation and supervision of financial systems and financial institutions, state aid to the financial sector and the assessment of crisis management mechanisms in the euro area have been addressed.
The Contact Commission has adopted a statement addressed to the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission, as well as to the parliaments and governments of the EU Member States.
In addition, the Contact Committee adopted a resolution to take into account the opinion of the euro area ORKB on the relevant external financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
The declaration and resolution are available on the website of the Contact Committee (www.contactcommittee.eu).
23 Main speakers of the 2011 meeting of the Contact Committee: Commissioner Olli Rehn, Minister of Finance of Luxembourg Luc Room and Vice-President of the ECB Vítor Constâncio, together with the President of the Court of Auditors Vítor Caldeira (third from the left).
24 DECLARATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN SEMSTER AND THE OTHER SEAT OF THE EU DECLARATION OF THE EU DECLARATION FOR THE SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORITIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN THIS COMMITTEE OF THE DECLARATION ON 14 OCTOBER 2011, the Contact Committee is convinced that whenever the use of public funds is concerned, the following principles must be observed: due transparency in the form of reliable and timely information (including national statistics) concerning the current or planned use of public funds and the risks involved; adequate accountability should be carried out and decision-makers should be held responsible for the management of the procedures; adequate public control should be ensured for the use of public funds.
In order to respond effectively to the economic and financial crisis and its effects in the field of financial control in the field of public finances, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority will, as far as possible and as possible, consider, in order to adapt their audit activities to the new framework conditions.
In some cases, this process has already started by introducing new and updated control tasks.
25 Further development of cooperation between the EU's OPCW and the EU's growing links between economies clearly point to the value of a common approach that can be achieved through close cooperation within the Contact Committee.
This includes, inter alia, joint learning from recent audit results and their impact on the collection and exchange of knowledge; the identification and dissemination of current best practices in the control of new (and existing) systems; the identification of gaps in public control and possible new audit tasks and new partnerships and the consideration of best practices in this area; the consideration of the development of specific audit methods and techniques under the ORKB; and the tools and guidelines for their application; in order to develop these activities, the Contact Committee will benefit from existing control networks in the area of the Europe 2020 strategy and financial policy and of parallel and coordinated controls and other cooperation activities.
Meeting of the Contact Committee in Luxembourg in 2011 on 13 and 14 October 2011
26 Network Network of Countries of Workers and Countries of Workers of POTENTIAL Workers The Court actively participated in the activities of the ORC network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries1.
The organisational structure of the network shall be comparable to the structure of the contact committee and shall include regular meetings of the Chairpersons of the ORKB and liaison officers, as well as working groups, seminars, workshops and parallel controls.
The main objective is to support the use of control methods and procedures in line with EU international standards and best practices.
The meeting of the network presidents was held in Istanbul on 8 and 9 March 2011.
This meeting was jointly chaired by the Turkish Court of Auditors and the European Court of Auditors, which led to the adoption of the Istanbul Memorandum of Understanding, including the work programme for future actions to be carried out with the active support of the European Court of Auditors, the SIGMA and EU-ORKB representatives.
OTHER FORMS OF COOPERATION In 2011, the European Court of Auditors, with the participation of the ORKB of Austria and Finland, carried out a peer review of the Norwegian Court of Auditors.
This report was published in June 2011.
The Court continued its active participation and participation in INTOSAI and EUROSAI activities.
Since 2004, when the Court became a full member of INTOSAI, it has actively participated in the sub-committees on technical standards for the different types of examinations.
In 2011, these subcommittees started implementing their new work plans, focusing on the harmonisation of the ISSAI framework, as well as on the dissemination of standards and guidelines, following the approval by the XX Congress of Incosai in November 2010 of a comprehensive set of international standards (ISSAI).
In addition, the Court has contributed to the subcommittee to promote best practices and quality assurance through voluntary peer reviews and subcommittees to support actions to enhance the competences of the members of INTOSAI and INTOSAI within the Environmental Assessment Working Group.
Since 2008, the Court has also chaired the INTOSAI Working Group on the audit and audit of civil protection assistance.
An important objective of this working group is to develop guidelines on responsibility for civil protection assistance and to identify and disseminate best practices, focusing on actions aimed at stakeholders ( multilateral bodies, assistance organisations, governments, private controllers).
1 In February 2012, the network included five candidate countries (Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey) and three potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia).
With regard to EUROSAI, the Court is now more involved as it is a member of the Bureau for the next six years.
The Court actively participated in the VIIIth Congress of EUROSAI (from 30 May to 2 June 2011), in which the main theme was the challenges, requirements and competences of the public administration, the role and control of independent regulatory agencies.
A declaration was adopted which strengthened the independence of the ORKB.
In December 2011, the joint efforts of the INTOSAI Community and its regional working groups to strengthen the independence of the ORKB and the recognition of the Lima and Mexico Declaration reached the summit in the adoption of a resolution on the promotion of effective, responsible, effective and transparent public administration by strengthening the highest control and control bodies by the United Nations General Assembly 27.
28 The different actions of the European Court of Auditors in the Court of Auditors in relation to the examination of own resources VAT On 15 November 2011, the Court of Justice delivered a judgment in Case C-539/09 Commission v Federal Republic of Germany on the control powers of the European Court of Auditors in respect of VAT own resources.
This is due to the refusal by the German Ministry of Finance to authorise the European Court of Auditors in 2006 to carry out checks on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in Germany in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
In preparation of Special Report No 8/2007, the Court decided to carry out audits in eight Member States, including Germany.
Germany contested the Court's right to carry out that review.
The German Government has stated that the cooperation referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 between the administrative authorities of the Member States has no direct link with the EU's revenue, since value added tax must be distinguished from national VAT and therefore VAT.
The latter are determined on the basis of a number of calculations and represent a relatively small proportion of the amounts charged by the Member States as VAT.
The Court strongly rejected the argument of the German Government, which is based on the strict contrast between the VAT revenue of the Member States and the Union's own resources on value added tax.
In the light of the arguments put forward by the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Auditors, the Court of Auditors stressed the dependence of VAT own resources on the revenue of the Member States.
The Court of Justice confirmed that the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax included the establishment of cooperation mechanisms between Member States that would enable them to combat VAT evasion more effectively and the collection of value added tax more effectively.
This also affects the availability of own resources for VAT for the EU budget.
If cooperation between national authorities is effective and in line with the Regulation, it may contribute to the reduction of fraud and the effective collection of VAT in the Member States and to the maintenance of VAT own resources at the level required by the various relevant EU legislation and thus to the maintenance of the overall level of own resources.
The Court found that the Court of Auditors was entitled to carry out a planned audit in connection with administrative cooperation in the field of VAT as it referred to the EU's revenue as regards legality and sound financial management and was therefore directly linked to the powers conferred on the Court of Auditors under the Treaty.
In Case C-539/09, the Court had, for the first time, to clearly define the scope of the Court's audit powers.
The ruling of the Court of Justice is valuable and encouraging as it clarifies and strengthens the powers of the institutions in the field of control vis-à-vis the Member States.
In 2010, the Court awarded the first prize for the research work in the field of public sector audit in order to establish contacts with universities and to support the development of public control in Europe.
This first award was an expression of the memory of Jesús Lázaro Cuenca, the former director of the Court, who for many years contributed to the development of methods and methods of control of the institution.
The winners of the Lázaro Sara Belleil and José Antonio Fernández Ajenjo Awards were awarded by the President of the Court of Justice of Vítor Caldeira and by the selection panel of the public ceremony held in Luxembourg on 5 July 2011.
Both laureates presented their scientific opinions at the academic meeting: Sara Belleil: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: already: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e:: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e:: e:: e: e:: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e: e:e:e:e: e: e: e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:e:

31 OUR MANAGEMENT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIES FOR 2009 In the last few years, the Court has launched an internal reform process.
This includes the development of its first strategy for the period 2009-20122 to achieve the following general objectives: to maximise the overall impact of controls; to improve efficiency through the best use of resources.
Many of the priority actions foreseen in the strategy have already been completed; the remaining actions in 2012 will be published in the 2 audit strategy for the period 2009-2012 on the website www.eca.europa.eu. The main achievements achieved in 2011 are: an increase in the number of special reports; an average of 16 special reports have been published in 2009-2011, which exceeded the annual objective of 12-15 reports; a major contribution to the reform of the EU budget; an increase in the preparation of regular reports on the follow-up of previous findings, including the general follow-up report to be carried out in 2012; a renewed audit strategy and guidelines; an increase in the emphasis on fundamental actions through the posting of staff from audit support services; a publication of a document on follow-up to the current financial and economic crisis for public responsibility and financial control in the EU and the role of the Court.
The Court strengthened its audit management framework in 2008 by adopting ethical guidelines based on the obligations and the INTOSAI Code of Conduct and the International Standards of Quality Control in the ORB3.
In this context, the Court established a procedure which would ensure, on an annual basis, sufficient assurance that its auditors meet the relevant ethical requirements.
Compliance with the values set out in the ethical guidelines, such as impartiality, objectivity, loyalty and professional secrecy, ensures that the Court's employees act in the public interest without external pressure and without affecting their personal or financial interests.
The Court's framework for professional proceedings shall promote the reliability of the information provided to it by the addressees.
3 ISSAI 30 and ISSAI 40.
32 In 2011, work was started on another strategy based on the successes of the current strategy, which ended in 2012.
The Court takes the opportunity to adapt to developments in the EU and in the audit field and to take into account the needs and expectations of its addressees.
Members of the European Court of Auditors
Dates of implementation of the Court of Justice in 2011 33 Since 2008 the Court has progressively developed a set of key performance indicators (ZLIs) in order to inform the management of the progress made in achieving the 2009-2012 objectives; to support the decision-making process; to provide information on the results among the addressees.
These indicators shall measure the basic parameters of the quality and impact of the Court's work, with particular regard to the position of key addressees and the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources.
2011 is the second year in which all indicators were available.
The Court continues to find the results of its key performance indicators encouraging, in particular as regards the quality and effectiveness of its audit work.
In addition, indicators clearly identify the areas where progress needs to be made and the problems that need to be addressed in order to achieve progress in the future.
2010 4.2 4.0 ≥ 4.2 3.7 3.7 ≥ 3.7 Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's reports on the main objective of 2011. Assessment of the quality and impact of the Court's audit activities by the audited bodies The results show that the main audits of the Court's reports show that they are of average benefit to the Court.
In particular, the clarity and usefulness of the reports and the professionalism of the Court's auditors shall be assessed.
34 CONTROLS BY EXPERTS Two external bodies reviewed the content and presentation of a sample of the Court's reports published in 2011.
The auditors assessed four special reports and annual reports on the general budget and the EDF for 2010.
They assessed the quality of the various aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale to a large extent affected in (1) in high quality on (4).
2010 3.0 2.8 ≥ 3.0 Objective 2011 Review of the content and presentation of the Court's reports by external experts Results show that the auditors assess the quality of the Court's 2011 reports satisfactorily.
The reviews provided valuable information and the resulting recommendations will be used to improve the quality of future reports.
ENFORCEMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONSIN its recommendations The Court contributes to improving financial management.
This indicator is based on the recommendations contained in the annual and special reports published in 2011.
In 2010, 90% of 93% ≥ 90% of the 2011 target. The percentage of audit recommendations approved by the audited entity in 2011 started the systematic monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations by the audited bodies.
Since 2012, the Court will be able to inform the extent to which the recommendations are implemented in practice and the extent to which they are implemented and how they are implemented.
The Court shall assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources, depending on the extent to which it is able to submit timely reports and audit reports, fulfil its financial management obligations and ensure the well-being and competence of its staff.
The Court shall endeavour to adopt all audit reports within the time limits set.
For annual reports and special annual reports, the time limits laid down in the provisions should be respected.
In the case of special reports for which there is no publication date specified in the provisions, the scheduled date of adoption shall be deemed to be the point of point.
35 4 2010 90 % of the number of reports adopted at 80 % 2011 83 % 90 % 75 % 90 % Overall, the Court did not fully meet its objectives in 2011.
The very high target for the number of reports was not achieved, while the overall target of 12-15 special reports per year exceeded and the results were higher than in 2010.
All annual reports and, except for one, all special annual reports have been adopted and published in accordance with the timetable.
4 The objectives of these indicators have been changed from 100% (2008-2010) to 90% to take account of unexpected events.
CONTROL OPERATIONS shall contain detailed information on the detailed control arrangements and shall be drawn up following inspection visits in the Member States or in the Commission.
The Court uses them to confirm the accuracy of its findings by the assessment bodies, which is an important step in the audit process.
The Court has already stated that there is a significant need to improve timelyness and that the objective to be achieved by the end of 2012 is to develop 80% of the inspection notifications within two months of the inspection.
2010 2011 Percentage of audit reports prepared at 54 % 58 % target in 20114 The number of reports adopted compared to the number of reports planned The target for 2011 80% by 2012. The Court has improved the timeliness of the audit notifications in 2011 but has not yet been achieved.
Significant progress has been made over the last three years (only 27% of audit communications were prepared in time in 2008), and the Court will continue to improve its performance.
36 EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Court seeks to obtain a full opinion from an independent auditor on the annual accounts and the use of resources and from the European Parliament on the basis of a positive opinion of the Council.
EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION ECONOMIC EDUCATION According to guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Court seeks to provide auditors with an average of 40 hours (five days) of vocational training (without language courses).
GRAD FOR THE FUTURE OF STAFF Internal interview on employee satisfaction conducted in 2009 in general 86% of the Court's employees were satisfied with their work, with an overall level of satisfaction of 2.8 on a scale of 1 to 4, each of which indicates an overall level of satisfaction of employees.
The Court seeks to maintain or improve this outcome in case of similar consultations in 2012.
SUPPORTING THE CONTROL ACTION The success of the Court's audit activities depends to a large extent on the quality of the support provided by its specialised services.
These services provide technical knowledge and logistics enabling the Court to recruit, maintain and motivate its staff and develop their professional skills; to disseminate the results of controls in all the official EU languages; to make the best use of information technologies; to manage the budget and to maintain infrastructure; to carry out audit visits in order to obtain evidence on the spot and on the spot in the countries where EU funds are collected and used.
37 STAFF STAFF The most important capital of the Court is its employees.
At 31 December 2010, the Court's human resources amounted to 887 staff (officials and temporary staff but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).

In 2011, with the aim of making the best use of resources, all services re-examined and implemented the possibilities of increasing efficiency by simplifying procedures.
As far as possible, jobs released as a result of productivity gains outside the control area have been transferred to the control service, which has contributed to an increase in the number of posts in the control area by 12.6% since 2008.

38 TERMINATION The Court's staff have a broad academic and professional context and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's results.
The Court's employment policy is in line with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and staff is composed of both officials and temporary staff.
The general procedures for the selection of posts at the Court are organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In addition, the Court establishes a policy of equal opportunities within its staff policy and in the case of employment, such as other EU institutions, within its staff policy and within its equal opportunities policy.
Following a steady increase in women's participation over the years, the Court has achieved a balanced participation of women and men among its employees.
In 2011, the Court recruited 75 staff: 23 officials, 24 temporary staff and 28 contract staff.
The Court has in particular managed to recruit new workers for the posts of auditors.
25 posts were serviceless on 31 December 2011, and in 2010 there was much less than in 2010 (44).
In this way, the job vacancy rate fell for the first time below 3%.
2001 2011 Men 54 % 50% Women 46 % 50% The following graph shows the percentage of men and women broken down as of 31 December 2011.
Of the 65 directors and heads of departments, 18 (28%) are women, reflecting the development of recent years.
Most of them, however, work in the Translation Directorate in and in the administrative departments.
After the last recruitment waves, 45% of the staff in grade AD5-AD8 are women.
PROFIL ALTERS According to the age profile of the staff active in employment on 31 December 2010, 60% of the Court's staff are 44 years old or younger.
Ages 20-24 0.00% 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 23 of 65 directors and heads of departments are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, in the next five to ten years, a major renewal will take place in senior management positions.
39 3.8% 16.3% 20.7% 19,2% 17.5% 11.5 % 7,6% 3,4 % PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION The controller's profession requires continuous training to keep up with new achievements and new skills.
In 2011, the Court's staff completed an average of 9.3 days of vocational training.
Language courses accounted for 54% of the total number of training days (compared with 57% in 2010).
In addition to language courses, the auditors completed 6.1 day of vocational training in 2011 and thus achieved an important objective of the institutions.
In 2011, a substantive improvement in training was introduced and new courses were developed in order to adapt to the audit priorities.
The Court has also improved the system for the management of training activities.
Written translation is an important action to support the audit to enable the Court to carry out its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2011, the volume of translations was comparable to the 2010 work volume.
More than 99% of translation services were completed on time.
In 2011, further posts and staff were transferred from the Translation Directorate to the Audit Service.

The Translation Directorate also supported the Contact Committee, the INTOSAI Working Groups and supported other specific needs related to the Court's audit activities.
In addition, the Court's Translation Directorate actively participated in interinstitutional and international bodies.
40 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology (IT) plays a key role in achieving the overall objectives of the Court's 2009-2012 strategy.
In 2011, the Court adopted the following measures: to strengthen investment in knowledge management by launching a new version of the training support instrument (the "Assyst2 in 2011") on the basis of a recently established cooperation platform; to actively continue to work on improving internal procedures through electronic working processes in areas such as business travel management and training; and electronic archiving of personnel documentation in order to continuously increase efficiency and efficiency; to continue to support mobility through the use of smartphones and laptop computers; and to start working on an extranet project, which will also play a key role in facilitating electronic exchanges with the Court's numerous partners (e.g. with stakeholders, budgetary authorities, new employees, suppliers).
These developments have been achieved while increasing operational and security security in emergency situations in order to ensure the availability and quality of all IT services provided by the Court.

In 2011, the Directorate continued its efforts to further improve efficiency and efficiency to release resources to transfer them to the control services.
On the basis of an agreement with the budgetary authorities (Parliament and Council) on the financing of the K3 building, a second building extending to the Court's main building was built at the end of 2008.
Construction work was completed in 2011 and the construction was completed at the end of the year.
Significant progress has been made in interior design.
The time and budget framework of the construction project shall be respected.
The Court will have a building at the end of 2012 and the removals will take place in the first quarter of 2013.
In 2009-2010, the Court concluded that the best achievement of its safety objectives and the most efficient and cost-effective risk management for the provision of reception and security services at internal level could be the most efficient and cost-effective.
In April 2011, this was done by replacing an external security service provider with a small team of contract staff.
The annual costs will be more than EUR 0.5 million lower in 2012 than in 2009.
CONTROL During the Court's audit work, auditors must go to the Member States and to other beneficiaries of EU funds, as well as to the headquarters of international organisations such as the United Nations.
The purpose of these inspection visits is to obtain direct control evidence.
Visits are usually carried out by central and local authorities involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds, as well as by final beneficiaries.
In the EU, checks are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities in the Member State visited.
The team of controllers usually consists of two to three controllers, and the duration of the examination trip may be up to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and the distance.
CONTROL In 2011, the Court carried out a total of 379 audit visits5 in 2011 in the Member States and in the 36 non-EU Member States in relation to audits in relation to annual reports and special annual reports and selected audit tasks.
A similar number of audit visits were carried out by EU institutions and bodies in Brussels and Luxembourg.
5 This corresponds to the number of Member States and beneficiary countries to which the audit visits have been carried out in relation to the various audit tasks.
In 2010, this figure was 376.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION The Court shall be financed by the general budget of the EU.
Its budget represents around 0,1% of the total EU expenditure and less than 2% of the total administrative expenditure.

44 In 2011, the total budget was 93%.
For Title 1 this indicator is 92%, with the lowest in Chapter 16 (Other expenditure on members and staff of the institution) (85%).
For Title 2, the average performance rate is 97%.
The amount of payments under Chapter 20 (buildings) depends on the construction work of the building K3.
The third financing tranche of EUR 7 million for this project was entered in the 2011 budget and was allocated and partly paid in 2011.
The remaining part of the funds allocated to the construction of K3 was transferred to 2012 and was allocated to the financing of contracts awarded to construction companies by the project manager on behalf of the Court.
This appropriation will be used as requested by the Court to the European Parliament and the Council in 2008.
The total cost of building K3 is estimated at EUR 79 million to be financed over the next five years: EUR 55 million in 2009; EUR 11 million in 2010; EUR 7 million in 2011, EUR 3 million in 2012 and 2013.
The 2012 budget has decreased by 1.28% compared to 2011, mainly due to the reduction in the budget allocated to the construction of K3.

46 INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONTROL The task of an internal audit body is to provide an independent and objective guarantee and provide advisory services in such a way as to increase and improve the added value of the Court's activities.
Supporting the Court in achieving the objectives of the institutions through a systematic and rigorous approach to evaluation and recommendations in order to improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and management procedures.
In carrying out its tasks, the Department of Internal Audit shall act in accordance with the provisions of the EU Financial Regulation, with the provisions applicable to EU officials, as well as with international standards of professional practice in the field of internal audit.
In 2009, the Court's internal audit services were checked and certified in accordance with the international standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors.
THE COURT'S EXTERNAL AUDIT The annual accounts of the European Court of Auditors shall be audited by an independent auditor.
This is a key element of the Court's efforts to ensure that it applies the same principles of transparency and accountability as those of the authorities it has carried out.
In 2011, the Court's internal audit services presented reports on the state of play of the Court's 2009-2012 strategy; on the implementation of key performance indicators; on the creation of a new K3 building of the Court; on the use of a trust account for payments to eligible beneficiaries; on the implementation of previous recommendations.
The internal audit services fully supported the Court's independent auditor in certifying the Court's annual accounts and the effectiveness of its internal audit procedures.
The Court's Internal Audit Committee advises on internal control issues and monitors the related internal control environment in the framework of the institution's risk management procedures.
In 2011, the Internal Audit Committee and Internal Auditors analysed the results of audits of the internal services and of the implementation of the action plans affecting the internal control environment and the risks associated with the management of the institution.
The auditor's report at PricewaterhouseCoopers SRL on the Court of Auditors' annual accounts for the financial year 2010 was published in September 20116.

In 2012, the Court focused on preparing the Union for the main challenges of financial management after 2013.
At the beginning of the year, the Court adopted an opinion on some of the proposals for regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is the most famous EU policy.
The draft regulation was part of the legislative package for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework.
In 2012, the Court issued a number of opinions and reports which actively contributed to the strengthening of the new rules which will be subject to EU revenue and expenditure during that period.
Moreover, in 2012, the Court continued to monitor to a large extent the impact of changes in the EU's economic governance on public responsibility and financial control.
This year the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism entered into force and the audit committee of the new body, including the representative of the Court, took place at its first meeting.
In December 2012, the Council of the European Union adopted a position on the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism to ensure the supervision of euro area credit institutions and the Court presented its position to EU policy makers on public responsibility and financial control.
Many changes in the EU's economic governance and budget are due to the fact that better political results are to be achieved with lower public resources, while strengthening democratic legitimacy and accountability.
In view of its unique competences and views, on the one hand, and the experience of controls over 35 years, and, on the other hand, the partnership built for this purpose, the Court is well prepared to help the EU to meet these challenges.
On the basis of the achievements achieved in recent years, the Court's objective is to maximise the Court's contribution to improving the EU's reporting obligation in 2013-2017.
The farm is now celebrating its 35th anniversary.
Since the Court started work in 1977, Europe has changed significantly.
The structure and the way in which the Court is carried out reflect these changes.
With the accession of the new Member States, the transfer of competences to the Union and the creation of many bodies at EU level, the scope of the Court's audit has been extended.
The Court has also grown up as an organ, from nine members and 120 employees in 1977 to 27 members and almost 900 employees in 2012.
This increase enabled the farm to create professional, committed and experienced staff.
2012 was the last year covered by the Court's strategy for 2009-2012.
During this period, the Court noted encouraging results.
As this Annual Activity Report shows, production has been increased and external experts consider the quality of our reports to be good and institutional experts consider them useful.
The Commission's acceptance of the Court's recommendations remains high and the Court's new monitoring report highlights the positive effects of these recommendations.
The Court can also point to an increase in administrative and translation efficiency, which led to 40 additional staff at the end of that period.
To achieve the 2013-2017 objectives, the Court will prioritise products aimed at improving the EU's reporting obligation and the development and development of partnerships, professionalism and effectiveness.
In 2013, the International peer review team will examine the practice of checking the performance of the Court's tasks and will examine the results of the previous peer review of 2008.
Other key actions that will be launched in 2013 include improving the Court's reporting procedures, as well as making better use of our common foundation of knowledge, our expertise and our expertise.
In the coming years, the Court intends to support the EU in addressing the growing challenges of public responsibility and financial control.

8 2012 IN OUR ACTIONS on the Annual Reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund for the financial year 2011, which improved the clarity and quality of the information. on 50 specific annual reports on the various EU agencies, decentralised bodies and agencies for the financial year 2011. on 25 specific reports on certain areas of the budget or management issues. o 9 Opinions on the contribution to the budgetary reform, such as the reform of the common agricultural policy and the European Parliament and Council Directive on the fight against fraud, which are the subject of the financial interests of the European Union.
OUR MANAGEMENT for the adoption of the new strategy for 2013-2017, which will guide the activities of the Court in this period, in order to maximise the Court's contribution to EU public accountability. o Our key performance indicators for the period 2008-2012 show an improvement in performance; for the first time, they show the contribution of our recommendations to the implementation. o Further development of staff policy and the further relocation of posts to the audit service by increasing the administrative and translation performance of the Court's mission. o Building work in Building K3 in the Court's second enlarged territory, in order to put all the Court's staff in one place.
9 OUR CONTROL REPORTS AND NOTES The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are: o o Annual accounts are: o Annual accounts and audits of compliance with the budget of the European Union and the European Development Fund (EDF); in addition, special annual reports on agencies, decentralised bodies and bodies of the EU are published separately; o special reports, which may be published at any time during the year, together with the results of selected audits on specific areas of budget or management; these are mainly efficiency audits; on opinions on draft legislative acts affecting financial management and on statements and statements on other issues on the Court's own initiative.
Since 2008, the number of special annual reports and special reports of the Court has increased significantly.
The annual reports have also been developed: more analytical information is currently available, data presentation has been more harmonised to facilitate comparison, both between sectors and over time, and a new chapter on performance issues has been added.
The substantial increase in the opinion is the result of the consultation of the Court on the extensive legislative proposals for the new financial framework (2014-2020).

10 CONTROL In 2012, while the vast majority of the audit work is carried out at the Court's premises in Luxembourg, the auditors also make visits to EU institutions, agencies and decentralised institutions, to Member States' authorities and to other beneficiaries of EU funds (including the headquarters of international organisations such as the United Nations in Switzerland).
Verification visits shall normally apply to central and local authorities involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds as well as to final beneficiaries.
In the EU, controls are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities in the Member States visited.
The team of controllers usually consists of two to three controllers, and the duration of the examination trip may be several days to two weeks, depending on the type of examination and the distance.
In 2012, the Court's auditors spent 6,816 days on on-the-spot checks In the Member States 6,054 and 762 from outside the EU In 2012, they received evidence that the annual reports, the special annual reports and the tasks selected.

11 The main conclusions of the 2011 Annual Report on the Financial Statements for 2011 constitute the relevant financial situation of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year in question.
Revenue and liabilities were not significantly affected by errors.
However, payments were largely affected by errors, with an estimated error rate for the EU budget as a whole of 3.9%.
This error rate is similar to 3.7% in 2010 o All individually assessed spending areas in the EU, with the exception of external relations policy areas, external assistance and enlargement, as well as administrative expenditure.
This shows that improvements in the management of EU funds are still needed. the Court estimates that the error rate in rural development, the environment, fisheries and health expenditure (the most defective expenditure area) was 7.7%.
The error rate for regional policy, energy and transport is estimated to remain high at 6.0%. O In the case of the Commission's reservations, the error rate for regional policy, energy and transport increased from EUR 0.4 billion in 2010 to EUR 2.0 billion in 2011.
This is because in some areas, in particular in the field of rural development, cohesion and research, the Commission has recognised that there is a high risk of errors. o Overall, the control systems examined are only partially effective in order to ensure the regularity of payments and do not ensure, to the extent possible, the prevention or detection of errors and their correction.
A number of cases of failure to check have been identified. The self-assessment carried out by the Commission in relation to its results has led to further development compared to previous years.
However, in 2011 the Court's performance checks found that there is often a lack of analysis of good quality needs, weaknesses in the concept of the programme have a negative impact on the reporting of results and impacts and that the Commission needs to demonstrate European added value.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU BUDGET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2011Most audits carried out by the Court in the field of accounting and compliance control in 2012 were devoted to the implementation of the EU budget for 2011.
The 2011 Annual Report was published on 6 November 2012.
The annual report aims to assist the European Parliament, the Council and the citizens in assessing the quality of EU financial management and to recommend appropriate improvements by making arrangements and proposals.
The 18th Annual Statement of Assurance (...) on the reliability of the EU accounts and on the regularity of the underlying transactions is a fundamental element of the annual accounts for the financial year 2011.
The annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2011 contains two new chapters, which contain more targeted results in the field of agriculture and cohesion.
The previous chapter on agriculture and natural resources has been replaced by a chapter in: Market support and direct payments in and in h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND 2011 The European Development Funds (EDFs) are financed by EU Member States but managed outside the EU budget and are subject to financial rules.
The European Commission is responsible for the financial management of the EDF-funded activities.
With the European Development Fund (EDF), the European Union is assisting African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) in development cooperation under the Cotonou Agreement signed in 2000.
These expenditure is intended to reduce poverty and to reduce poverty in the end, in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP and OCT countries into the world economy.
The agreement is based on three complementary pillars: development cooperation, economic and trade cooperation and the political dimension.
The Court's 2011 annual report on the EDF was published on 6 November 2012 in parallel with the annual report on the EU budget.
The Court found that the annual accounts of the EDF for 2011 adequately reflect the financial situation of the EDF and the results of its operations and cash flows.
However, 33% of EDF operations were affected by errors, including an estimated payment rate of 5,1% affected by errors.
In 2012, the Court published 50 special annual reports covering mainly the 2011 financial year concerning agencies, decentralised bodies (e.g. Joint Undertakings) and other EU bodies.
Agencies and decentralised EU bodies shall be established on the basis of EU legislation to carry out specific tasks.
President Caldeira, during the presentation of the 2011 Annual Report at the plenary session of the European Parliament (November 2012)
In 2012, in addition to the annual reports, the Court shall publish, throughout the year, special reports containing the results of the performance and compliance checks carried out by the Court in the budgetary areas or management areas of its choice.
In selecting and shaping audit tasks, the Court seeks to achieve the maximum effect and thus to make the best use of its resources.
In choosing the subject matter, the Court takes into account the following factors: the risk to profitability or compliance with legal standards in the area of income or expenditure; the level of income or expenditure; the time since the previous audit; the future changes in the legal framework; the political and public interest.
In 2012, the Court adopted 25 special reports covering a wide range of issues.
This represents a significant increase compared to the 16 special reports adopted in 2011 (and 12 in 2008).
All special reports are available in 22 EU languages on the Court's website: http://eca.europa.eu/.
The following pages present the topics of the special reports adopted in 2012, within the relevant headings of the 2013-2017 financial framework within the framework of the EU Multi-annual Budget Plan.
H y h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
EU expenditure on growth and employment for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 89.4 billion, i.e. 9.2% of the EU budget, of which almost two thirds are R &amp; D.
Cohesion for growth and jobs mainly concerns cohesion policy implemented by the Funds for specific areas of activity: the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF).
The EU budget for cohesion for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 344.4 billion, or 35.7% of the EU's total budget.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports: the financial instruments for SMEs co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (R Regional Development Fund) (No 2/2012). The special report assessed the effectiveness and effectiveness of the financial engineering measures co-financed by the ERDF for the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 programming periods. The audit concerned the sample of projects in Germany, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary and the United Kingdom and assessed the management, monitoring and information systems of the Commission and the Member States.
The Court found that the impact on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the expenditure on financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) incurred under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was infringed as the regulatory framework did not provide an adequate basis for the use of the various types of financial instruments.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy and provide employment, innovation and prosperity.
However, SMEs may not be able to meet their financial needs in the required form and amount.
To support them, the EU uses entrepreneurship and cohesion policies, mainly in the form of assistance, and increasingly in the framework of the ERDF in the framework of the financial instruments.
Financial instruments are returnable and renewable instruments.
According to the Commission's figures, the ERDF allocations for financial instruments amount to EUR 1.6 billion and EUR 10.4 billion respectively for the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 programming periods.
o Structural Funds in did the Commission respond effectively to the shortcomings identified in the management and control systems in the Member States?
(No 3/2012) The special report examines the extent to which the Commission has put in place appropriate corrective measures, ensured their timely implementation and ensured sufficient assurance that their actions have ensured appropriate financial corrections in relation to irregularities in the past and to the improvement of the systems in order to avoid recurrence of irregularities.
The audit was carried out mainly on the basis of a review of 40 programmes for which serious deficiencies were identified.
The Court found that, with regard to the shortcomings in the management and control systems in the Member States, the Commission ensured quite well the correct application of financial corrections, but only to a lesser extent ensured that its actions led to the improvement of the systems in the Member States.
Expenditure on the Structural Funds shall be managed by the Commission and the Member States.
Member States shall draw up multiannual programmes which are examined and approved by the Commission and subsequently implemented by the Member States.
In the event of serious shortcomings in the management and control systems in the Member States, the Commission seeks to ensure that irregularities are corrected and improved. to use the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to co-finance transport infrastructure in maritime ports: an effective investment?

The Court found that investments in maritime port infrastructure under cohesion policy were only effective for 11 out of the 27 projects audited.
Maritime transport is the second most important mode of transport in the EU.
The Commission expects an increase from 3.8 billion tonnes in 2006 to 5.3 billion tonnes in 2018.
Since 2000, the EU has allocated around €6.2 billion to co-finance maritime port infrastructure from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.

16 THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF GROWTH TO SUPPORT infrastructure projects in municipal waste management in structural actions provides effective support to Member States in the implementation of the EU waste policy objectives?
(No 20/2012) This special report assessed the results of 26 waste management infrastructure projects in the sample, including the implementation of EU waste policy objectives, as well as the implementation of accompanying actions in the eight regions in which the infrastructure is located.
The Court found that insufficient implementation of accompanying measures and shortcomings in EU legislation and guidance had an impact on the effectiveness of supporting municipal waste management infrastructure in EU structural measures.
In 2010, every citizen of the 27 EU Member States produced on average about 500 kg of waste which, if not properly collected, processed and disposed of, could have a negative impact on the environment.
The EU has introduced common standards and objectives in the form of directives on the management of municipal waste and has co-financed waste management infrastructure in certain regions.
In 2000-2013, the EU allocated €10.8 billion to waste management infrastructure. about the cost-effectiveness of investments in energy efficiency in the framework of cohesion policy (No 21/2012), the special report assessed whether the investments in energy efficiency in cohesion policy were cost-effective by examining whether planning and financing created the right conditions to allow cost-effective investments in energy efficiency and whether energy efficiency projects in public buildings were cost-effective.
The Court found that the average return on EU investment in energy efficiency is more than 50 years (in extreme cases up to 150 years), which means that funds for this type of investment could be used more cost-effectively.
The cost of increased energy consumption, the depletion of fossil fuel consumption and the impact of human activity on global climate change is the driving force of the recent EU policy to increase energy efficiency.
Since 2000, the European Union has spent almost EUR 5 billion in co-financing energy efficiency actions in the Member States in the framework of cohesion policy.
(No 23/2012) This special report examined whether the project's objectives were achieved, whether the targeting of EU funding was based on sound criteria and whether the results achieved were achieved at the lowest cost for the EU budget.
The Court examined the results of 27 projects to revitalise the sanctified areas in which EU co-financing of a total of EUR 231 million was used and examined the tools to revitalise the sanctified areas which provide a framework for concrete co-financed actions in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the United Kingdom.
(The results of this special report will be published on 18 April 2013)
In recent decades, more and more broken industrial and military areas (so-called broken and broken areas) have become available.
Many surfaces are contaminated.
The regeneration and re-use of declining areas will be supported by EU structural actions to support the protection of human health and the environment and to combat the relocation of rural areas.
Between 2000 and 2013, the total amount of EU funds for this area amounted to EUR 5.7 billion.
o The European Union Solidarity Fund's response to the 2009 Abruzzo earthquake: the importance and costs of the action (No 24/2012) assessed whether the actions financed were in line with the EUSF Regulation and whether the construction project for which most of the expenditure was spent was well planned and planned and with due regard to the cost savings aspect.
The Court found that other funded projects were eligible, but the CASE project was not in line with the EUSF Regulation.
In addition, weaknesses were noted in the planning of the CASE project and in the provision of savings in its implementation.
The 2009 earthquake in the centre of the Italian region of Abruzzo caused damage of more than EUR 10 billion.
The European Union has supported Italian disaster management, contributing EUR 0.5 billion from its solidarity fund, which has been used to rescue, provide shelter and temporary schools, and to the CASE project to build earthquake-safe homes.
L Chair in Aquila Italy almost four years after the 2009 earthquake o Are there instruments to monitor the effectiveness of spending on older workers under the European Social Fund?
(No 25/2012) The special report examines whether and to what extent Member States and the Commission have developed and implemented appropriate instruments to assess the achievement of the targets for older workers.
Six programmes worth EUR 222 million were selected, covering four Member States: Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.
The Court found that neither the Member States nor the Commission could express the extent to which the actions financed under the ESF actually benefit older workers.
In the period 2007-2013, ESF expenditure to support Member States in the field of employment will amount to over EUR 75 billion, representing around 8% of the total EU budget.
One of the main disadvantaged groups is older workers.

18 THE EU'S FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE JOINING AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES is politically responsible for agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for 2007-2013 is EUR 413.1 billion, or 42.3% of the EU budget.
The three quarters of the expenditure relate to direct payments to farmers and support for agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF) for agricultural purposes and to the improvement of the quality of the quality and quality of the quality of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund for Rural Development and Rural Development, and to the improvement of the quality of the quality and quality of the quality of life of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, and to the improvement of the quality and quality of life of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and Guarantee Fund for Rural Development and Rural Development.
The next fifth part of the expenditure includes support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second pillar of the CAP.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine: progress so far (No 7/2012) in this special report has been assessed on progress towards one of the main objectives of the reform of the wine sector, namely progress towards a better balance between supply and demand.
The audit focused on measures under the grubbing-up and restructuring and conversion premiums for vineyards, which constitute the two main expenditure areas and which are essential for achieving the objective of achieving a better balance between supply and demand.
The Court found that these two measures were contradictory and that the structural supply surpluses were not significantly reduced.
For a period of three years of application of the grubbing-up measure ( 2008/2009-2010/2011), the EU budget was EUR 1.1 billion.
For the restructuring and restructuring period of 10 years up to 2010, €4.2 billion was allocated to target aid for the modernisation of agricultural holdings for specific purposes (No 8/2012).This special report examines whether EU aid for the modernisation of agricultural holdings was targeted at EU priorities and the specific needs of the Member States.
The Court found that measures aimed at modernising agricultural holdings would potentially be more effective, by using more targeted funds to meet the EU's priorities and the specific needs of the Member States and by making effective use of the selection procedures.
This aid concerns the financing of investments in agricultural holdings, from investments in simple products such as agricultural products or wooden fruit boxes, to investments in complex projects such as biogas.
The EU budget for this assistance (the EAFRD) for the 2007-2013 programming period amounts to EUR 11.1 billion, representing around 11% of all EU rural development expenditure. o Control of the control system governing the production, processing, distribution and import of organic products (No 9/2012) The special report examines whether the control system for organic products provides sufficient assurance of the fulfilment of the key production, processing, distribution and import requirements for organic products.
It has examined how different stakeholders (the European Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States, accreditation bodies and certification bodies) have fulfilled their tasks in the EU and in the management of import systems.
The Court found that the competent authorities in the Member States encountered difficulties in ensuring the traceability of organic products and that the system should address the shortcomings that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the system is functioning effectively and to ensure that consumer confidence is not undermined.
The objective of the EU legal framework for organic production is to provide the basis for the sustainable development of organic production, to ensure a level playing field, to protect consumers' interests while ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.
A control system has been introduced whereby each operator in the supply chain is controlled and certified. for direct aid for suckler, ovine and caprine cows in the framework of the partial implementation of the single payment scheme (No 11/2012) in the framework of that specific report has examined whether the aid has been targeted at the most appropriate regions in the Member States, whether it has been effective in maintaining specific production and thus in preventing negative social, economic and environmental impacts, and whether it has been subject to appropriate monitoring and evaluation by the Commission and the Member States.
The Court found that direct CAP support for maternal herds does not produce better results than non-production-related aid.
Following the 2003 CAP reform, agricultural aid previously granted in the form of direct payments linked to the production of certain agricultural products (so-called production-related aid) (so-called production-related aid) should no longer be paid, depending on production after the introduction of the single payment scheme (so-called production-related aid).
However, for certain sectors and regions, certain derogations are provided for from total separation from production in order to reduce the potential negative effects of the immediate transition to such a system.
The total budget for this direct aid for 2011 was EUR 1.0 billion.

Monitoring, targeted assistance, implementation and financing of measures to ensure compliance with sanitary rules have been examined.
The Court examined slaughterhouses in Poland, Romania, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which received EU funds.
While the Court found that the systems of the Commission and the competent authorities set up to monitor hygiene legislation were appropriate, the audit revealed a number of shortcomings in the implementation of those systems, which indicate that, in order to reduce risks, more severity is needed at all levels.
The Member States that joined the EU since 2004 had to ensure that their slaughterhouses complied with EU hygiene rules.
Since these rules generally contained far more stringent requirements than national rules, EU funds have been allocated to help slaughterhouses comply with hygiene rules and to modernise them.
The special pre-accession programme for agriculture and rural development (Sapard programme) allocates around €117 million to 241 slaughterhouses.
The support was then continued under the EAGGF and EAFRD. on the effectiveness of the single area payment scheme as a transitional scheme to support farmers in the new Member States (No 16/2012) under this special report examined the main shortcomings, such as payments to beneficiaries who do not carry out (or do not carry out marginal) agricultural activities, payments to farmers who have resigned from non-agricultural activities, payments to public authorities and payments focused on the few large beneficiaries.
The Court found that part of the aid had been paid to beneficiaries who had had a small agricultural activity or had no agricultural activity, including in the public sector, and that the distribution of the aid did not take account of the specificities of the regional agricultural activity or of the farmers' contribution to the production of public goods.
Moreover, a large majority of farmers receive a very small amount of aid.
The single area payment scheme is a simplified income support scheme for farmers in the Member States who have joined the EU since 2004.
In 2011, payments amounted to around EUR 5 billion.
The Court adopted the following special report in 2012: on the European Integration Fund and on the European Refugee Fund effectively contribute to the integration of third-country nationals?
(No 22/2012) The Special Report assessed whether the European Integration Fund and the European Refugee Fund, which are part of the EU's general programme 2007-2013 (SOLID) effectively contributed to the integration of third-country nationals into the EU, whether the results were supported by effective monitoring and evaluation of the programme, whether the concept of the Funds contributed to the effective implementation of the Funds, and whether the implementation systems for the integration of the SOLID programme were properly managed.
The Court found that, although positive results were found for the various projects audited, for which inadequate systems were introduced in order to measure the success of the funds.
The effectiveness of the funds has been reduced by the programme and coordination with other EU funds has been insufficient.
The EU supports the integration of third-country nationals in the EU Member States and increases solidarity by sharing the financial burden of managing common external borders and implementing common policies in the field of asylum and immigration.
The EU budget for the Solid programme for 2007-2013 is estimated to amount to a total of EUR 4.0 billion.
21 In order to ensure the free movement of persons and to ensure a high level of protection for citizens, this policy area has been established.
It covers from the management of the EU's external borders to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters.
It includes asylum and immigration policies, police cooperation and the fight against crime.
The expenditure for this area is estimated to reach EUR 12.2 billion for the period 2007-2013.
22 THE EU'S FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK, AS THE EU'S Global PARTNER, in the field of external relations, focuses on: enlargement, ensuring stability, security and prosperity in the neighbourhood, actively promoting sustainable development on the international stage, promoting global political governance and ensuring strategic and civil security.
The EU has committed €55.9 billion to these objectives for the period 2007-2013, i.e. 5.7% of the planned expenditure.
The Commission shall manage expenditure in most cases directly through its central services or delegations.
In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: on the effectiveness of EU development aid for food security in sub-Saharan Africa (No 1/2012) in this special report examined the effectiveness of EU development aid for food security in sub-Saharan Africa by analysing whether EU aid for food security is relevant for the needs and priorities of the countries and whether EU action was effective.
The audit focused on direct EU assistance to develop three pillars of food security: food availability, food access and a sustainable diet.
The Court found that EU aid for the development of food security in sub-Saharan Africa is mostly effective and contributes significantly to the achievement of food security.
However, the Commission has not sufficiently taken into account the possibilities of EU support to other countries, which are also affected by chronic food uncertainties, and has not sufficiently taken into account the issue of nutrition.
Food security is a serious and persistent problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where hunger affects 30% of the population.
In 2002-2010, the EU financed the European Development Fund (EDF) in the region for food security measures for a total amount of over EUR 3.2 billion. for the Common Information System RELEX (CRIS) (5/2012). In this special report, it examined whether CRIS was able to meet the Commission's needs effectively and whether it was credible.
The audit included a review of the CRIS documentation available to the Commission and an analysis of the data contained in the CRIS.
The Court found that CRIS to a large extent met the Commission's needs for information on external actions.
After ten years of development, however, it still has weak points.
CRIS is an information system set up by the Commission to support the management of external actions.
The system's functions have been constantly extended since its launch in 2002.
It is currently the main reference system for the management and documentation of external actions, together with reports, and is financed both from the general budget of the EU and from the European Development Fund (EDF).
o European Union assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community (No 6/2012) (No 6/2012).This special report examines whether the Commission has developed a programme of assistance in line with the objectives of the instrument, whether appropriate implementation procedures have been established and whether the various projects have achieved the appropriate objectives.
The aim of the audit was not to assess whether the programme contributed to the objective of political unification.
The Court found that the programme met its objectives as an instrument of financial support for the Turkish Cypriot communities and that, despite significant constraints, it created an overall appropriate environment.
Some results have already been achieved, but their sustainability is often questionable, and the largest project under the programme could not be implemented.
Around a third of this amount was examined by the Court by means of its sample of agreements by the European Union for the development of drinking water and basic sanitary services in the sub-Saharan region (No 13/2012) in the context of this special report, whether the Commission managed EU development aid to improve the quality of drinking water and basic sanitary services in sub-Saharan Africa in such a way as to achieve effective and sustainable results.
The Court found that EU support improved access to drinking water and basic sanitary services.
On the other hand, less than half of the projects audited have financed the needs of the beneficiaries in a satisfactory way, and the benefits will only last if the revenue is secured and not based on charges.
Improving water supply and sanitation is crucial to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Supply of clean drinking water and sanitation contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction.
Between 2001 and 2010, EU expenditure on water and sanitation infrastructure in the sub-Saharan area amounted to around EUR 1.0 billion; as funding for water and sanitation infrastructure is earmarked for other areas of assistance, the Commission has, in total, provided more funding.

24 EU FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK ACTION AS A EU FINANCIAL PARTNER FOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE European Development Fund (EDF) TO A sustainable road network in sub-Saharan Africa (No 17/2012) its special report examines whether the EDF has effectively contributed to the sustainable development of the road network in sub-Saharan Africa, whether the road infrastructure supported by the EDF is sustainable and whether the Commission has effectively supported the sustainable development of road infrastructure.
The audit focused on the technical, financial and institutional sustainability of road infrastructure and 48 programmes which since 1995 have been supported under the eighth, ninth and tenth EDFs in six partner countries.
The Court found that the Commission's support for a sustainable road network in sub-Saharan Africa is partially effective.
The partner countries visited by the Court are not making sufficient efforts to ensure the sustainable development of road infrastructure, making the roads to varying degrees vulnerable to premature consumption.
Roads and other transport infrastructures are essential for regional integration, economic growth, social development, efficient public administration and security.
In sub-Saharan Africa, road transport is the most important means of transport for people and goods and represents more than 80% of the total transport of goods and services, and the demand for transport is growing rapidly.
In this region, the EU has allocated around €7.4 billion to the EDF in 1995-2011 for the European Union's Rule of Law Assistance to Kosovo (No 18/2012) (see introduction to performance control).

25 SUPERVISION ON ECONOMIC SUPERVISION European Union Rule of Law Assistance to Kosovo European Union Assistance to Kosovo Border Control Assistance to Kosovo and EULEX in Kosovo © EULEX, 2011, photo of Enisa Kasemi In the framework of the EU Rule of Law Assistance to Kosovo, the Court of Justice presented the mission of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in the spotlight for the first time.
Kosovo is the world's largest beneficiary of EU per capita financial assistance and the place of the largest civilian crisis management operation ever launched by the Union (European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo under EULEX).
The Court's Special Report No 18/2012 assessed the effectiveness of EU assistance to Kosovo in the field of the rule of law.
The audit focused on four sectors: police, judiciary, customs and the fight against corruption.
The Court also examined the coordination with other donors and the implementation of EULEX.
The study of such a complex area was a challenge.
Four verification visits were carried out in Kosovo.
There have been consultations with EULEX officials and the European Commission, as well as local officials, representatives of the international donor community and civil society organisations.
The audit team has examined projects under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and the Instrument for Stability and Monitoring, Advisory and Advisory (MMA) activities carried out by EULEX.
Meetings took place in Brussels with the Commission, the European External Action Service, the Council and NATO Secretariat.
In addition, the Court supported a team of experts.
The Court found that EU aid was not sufficiently effective.
Although the EU has contributed to capacity building, especially in the area of customs, the success of police and justice assistance has been modest.
In Kosovo, the level of organised crime and corruption remains high.
Justice continues to experience political influence, inefficiency and lack of transparency and enforcement.
The limited capacity to protect important witnesses in Kosovo and the difficulty in transferring witnesses abroad are serious shortcomings.
In the words of Gijs de Vries, a member of the Court responsible for the report, the Kosovo authorities do not assume sufficient priority for the rule of law and EU aid should be more effective.
Francisco de Miguel Rodriguez, head of the evaluation team, says that there is no place in the world other than Kosovo, where in such a small area there could be so many international donors for capacity building.
The Court concluded that EU coordination mechanisms, including coordination with the international community, should be improved.
Unlike the other Western Balkan countries, the lack of a common EU position on their independence poses a threat to their possible accession to the EU in the case of Kosovo.
In the field of communication, this analysis has moved towards new ways.
This was most frequently cited in 2012 in the Court's report, in which more than 130 articles were published in printed and electronic media.
In addition, a summary video was published on the Court's website.
It was a premiere for the Court, reflecting its desire to reach a wider audience.
The European Commission and the European External Action Service have accepted the Court's conclusions and recommendations.
The report was presented to the European Parliament and to the Council working groups.
In view of the importance of its findings, the UK Upper House has decided to take a comprehensive look at the report.
26 EU AUTHORITIES, AGENCIES AND OTHER AUTHORITIES In 2012, the Court adopted the following special reports in this area: Administrative expenditure of EU institutions, agencies and other bodies includes expenditure on staff (personal staff and pensions) and on buildings, equipment, energy, communication and information technology.
The total expenditure for 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 55.9 billion or 5.7% of the total EU budget. on The effectiveness of the European Commission's staff development (No 10/2012) for the period 2007-2013. The special report examines whether the Commission has agreed whether the development of its staff has been in line with the needs of the organisation or whether it has provided opportunities for further development of its staff, has created an environment to motivate staff to further develop their skills and apply them to the workplace.
The Commission's annual funding for external training and teaching material amounted to EUR 26,6 million in 2010. The annual investment in education and development included 230 000 days of training and 310 employees in the management of training and training, and for career development. o Did the Commission and Eurostat improve the procedures for the creation of reliable and reliable European statistics?
(No 12/2012) The special report assessed whether the procedures for the production of reliable and reliable statistics were improved by the Commission and Eurostat.
The improvement is directly linked to compliance with the Code of Conduct for European Statistics, which sets standards for the production, production and dissemination of statistics and for the implementation of the European Statistical Programme.
No assessment of the reliability of the specific statistical results has been carried out.
The Court found that the Commission and Eurostat had not yet fully implemented the Code of Conduct for European Statistics and that Eurostat had not developed the European Statistical Programme 2008-2012 as an effective tool for planning, monitoring and accountability.
Reliable and reliable statistics are crucial to the achievement of the tasks entrusted to the European Union.
Statistics are necessary in almost all areas for the formulation, application, monitoring and evaluation of the tasks and objectives of the Treaties, and for the collection and allocation of EU funds.
European policy decisions are increasingly based directly on statistics and statistical indicators are increasingly used as a factor in policy decisions or sanctions. on the management of conflicts of interest in selected EU agencies (No 15/2012) This special report assesses whether the selected agencies have properly managed conflicts of interest, whether there are appropriate guidelines and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest situations and whether the selected agencies have properly implemented guidelines and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest situations.
The review assessed guidelines and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest situations for four selected agencies which take decisions affecting consumer safety and health.
The Court found that the selected EU agencies did not adequately manage conflicts of interest.
The report examines the extent to which the recommendations made by the Court in the seven selected special reports from 2003 to 2009 were implemented by the Commission.
Further special reports concerned three budgetary areas: agriculture, energy and external action.
The Court assessed the actions taken by the Commission in response to the Court's recommendations.
The audit showed that the recommendations were taken into account: the Commission fully implemented 29% of the recommendations examined, mostly implemented 49%, partly implemented 20% and 2% did not.
Further information on the follow-up to the Court's recommendations can be found on page 39.
27 In 2012, the Court published a new type of report, namely a special report, which continued to implement the recommendations set out in the previous special reports.
EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITOR EN 2011 REPORT ON THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS' SPECIAL REPORTS Special Reports No 19 2012 ISSN 1831-0834
28 COMMENTS AND COMMENTS BY THE Court in 2012 in its opinions on proposals for new or amended legislative acts having financial implications contribute to improving the EU's financial management.
These opinions shall be issued at the request of other EU institutions and shall be used by the legislative bodies at the request of the European Parliament and the Council at the request of the European Parliament and the Council.
Opinions are available on the Court's website http://eca.europa.eu in all official EU languages.
29 OPINION No 1/2012 ON THE COMMISSION'S LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ON THE REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURE POLICY FROM 2014 (Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)) is to be reformed by 2013.
In October 2011, the Commission published a proposal containing the main elements of the CAP legislative framework for 2014-2020.
The new legal framework proposes maintaining the current two-pillar structure of the CAP and thus the two existing European financial instruments under the agricultural policy: the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
The Court recognised the Commission's efforts to simplify the CAP rules (e.g. not applying the different implementation models under the current single payment scheme, the introduction of a simplified scheme for small farmers).
In its conclusions, the Commission made a number of observations by Parliament, the Council and the Court.
However, legislative proposals continue, in principle, to focus on expenditure and control, and therefore, contrary to the stated intentions, they continue to comply with the performance rules.
The Court took note of the Commission's objective of paying CAP aid to active farmers and of seeking to achieve a more balanced distribution of direct payments to beneficiaries.
However, the Court had doubts as to whether the proposed measures could be effectively implemented without imposing an excessive administrative burden on administrative authorities and farmers.
In his view, the solution could consist in the combination of the general principles laid down in the Regulation and the systematic monitoring and monitoring by the Commission of their implementation.
It stated that the so-called "shortening' (shortening the aid beyond a certain ceiling) would have a limited impact on the redistribution of the aid.
This opinion has had a significant impact on the reflection on the future of the CAP.
More than 2000 articles have been published in the media.
The Court has been invited by a number of NGOs, farmers' fair organisers and other industrial forums to present an opinion and the European Parliament invites the Court's representatives to participate in the working groups on the subject.
Most of the European Parliament's recommendations have been incorporated into its own proposals for changes to legislation.
The legislative package will be put to the vote after the adoption of the multiannual financial framework.
30 COOPERATION WITH OTHER MAJOR ACCOUNT CONTROL AUTHORITIES The Court cooperates with other Supreme Audit Authorities (ORCs) mainly in the following bodies: the ORC Contact Committee of the EU Member States; the ORC Network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; international bodies for the control of public finances, in particular the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their European regional group (EUROSAI).
Meeting of EU Liaison Officers in Rome, April 2012 Meeting of the INTOSAI Sub-Committee in Luxembourg, September 2011
THE CONTACT COMMITTEE OF THE MAJOR AUDIT AUTHORITIES OF THE EU MEMBER STATES 31 In accordance with the EU Treaty, the Court of Auditors and the national audit bodies shall cooperate with full confidence and respect for their independence.
The Court is actively working with the CCCs of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee.
The Contact Committee shall meet once a year with the President of the EU-ORKB and the Court.
Working groups and task forces have been set up to support the development of common positions and practices.
In 2012, the Court supported the President-in-Office of the Contact Committee (ORKB of Portugal) in the preparation and organisation of the annual meeting in 2012, held on 18 and 19 October 2012 in Estoril (Portugal).
Two main issues were raised during the meeting: the challenges facing the ORKB in preparing for the next EU financial framework (2014-2020) and the recent developments in response to the financial crisis and the ORK experience in this area.
At its meeting, the Contact Committee decided to set up a task force on the analysis of the tasks and role of the ORKB, taking into account recent developments in the EU on the creation of a new economic, budgetary, financial and possible impact on the ORK.
The Court is a member of this task force to report to the Contact Committee in 2013.
In addition, in 2012, the Court provided administrative support to the Contact Committee and actively participated in the various working groups and networks.
In addition, in 2012, the Court supported the euro area ORKB initiative in order to ensure an adequate external financial control of the European Stability Mechanism.
In April 2012, the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union was given a common position on the proposal for a Statute for Article 30 of the Treaty establishing a mechanism.
The final version of the Statutes is broadly in line with this Common Position with regard to the Audit Committee.

WALUT IN THE COURT'S COLLEGE According to the Treaty, the term of office of the Members of the Court shall be six years and shall be renewable.
In 2012, five new members were selected from the Court: Henrik Otbo (Denmark), Pietro Russo (Italy), Ville Itälä (Finland), Kevin Cardiff (Ireland) and Baudilio Vaugurz (Spain).
A CHANGED CONVERGATION CODE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COURT In February 2012, the Court adopted a new Code of Conduct for Members, which takes account of the changes that took place eight years ago since the adoption of the previous Code.
Furthermore, the Court publishes the declarations of interests of its members on its website, which, to a large extent, contributes to transparency35.
36 MEASURING DATA ON THE THE CERTIFICATE OF THE TERMINATION OF THE COURT OF STRATEGIA 2009-2012 In 2008, the Court published its first strategy.
This strategy was applicable in 2009-2012 in order to achieve the greatest possible impact of the Court's audit and to increase efficiency through the best use of resources.
Overall, the Court has successfully implemented its strategy for the period 2009-2012.
Most of the Court's recommendations were adopted: the Commission concluded that around half of the recommendations issued in 2011 had been implemented and that the Court's main institutional addressees were satisfied with its annual and special reports, the quality of which was recognised by external experts as good and better, and in 2008 as good, as well as the increase in productivity, by increasing the number of employees in control chambers by 60 (501) compared with 564 in 2011 and by reducing the number of employees in administration and translation by 40.
With regard to the 2009-2012 strategic period, the Court has identified a number of key performance indicators to: inform the management of the progress made in achieving the objectives; to support the decision-making process; to provide information on the performance of the recipients.
Key performance indicators are used to measure the basic performance parameters and the impact of the Court's work, with particular regard to the position of key addressees and the effectiveness and effectiveness of its use of resources.
Since 2012 was the last year of the 2009-2012 strategic period, the results of the key performance indicators, where available, are presented every four years.
The Court will update the key performance indicators used during the 2013-2017 strategy period to adapt them to new or revised priorities and demonstrate their effectiveness and accountability as a professional control body.
The Court shall assess the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of the evaluation made by the addressees and by the experts.
ASSESSMENT BY ADDRESSATEN The Court asked the main addressees of its reports (European Parliament's and the Council's Committee on Budgetary Control) to assess the quality and impact of the 2011 annual reports and the special reports published in 2012.
The evaluation was carried out on a five-stage scale (1 very bad, 2 bad, 3 bad, 3 in a suitable, 4 in a good, 5 in a very good).
4.5 4.0 3.5 3.9 4.2 4.0 4.2 105 % of the Court's assessment of the Court's final audit reports of the main resources 37 2009 2010 2012 2012 Result The result remained stable throughout the period with a value of 3.9 to 4.2 on a five-stage scale.
This shows that the Court's reports are the main recipients of their average quality and impact on what is good.
In 2012, the Court achieved a score of five percent higher than that objective.
38 IMPLEMENTATION CONTROLS Each year independent external bodies reviewed the content and presentation of a sample of the Court's reports.
In 2012, the auditors assessed eight special reports and the 2011 annual reports.
They assessed the quality of the various aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale to a large extent affected in (1) to a high quality on (4).
3.5 3.0 2.5 3.0 3.0 2.8 3.0 106 % target 2011 2012 4.0 3.5 3.0 FEEDBACK TO THE HIGHLIGHTED HIGHLIGHTED AUTHORITIES 3.7 3.7 3.6 3.6 97 % target 2.8 THE COURT'S REPORTS REPORTED IN 2010 3.5 2009 2012 Result Target The objective On a four-stage scale in 2009-2012 ranged from 2.8 to 3.0 and shows that external experts assess the quality of the Court's reports as satisfactory in 2011.
The reviews provided the Court with valuable information on the quality of the reports and the recommendations of the auditors are used for further improvement.
In 2012, based on a survey and on the scale of the assessment carried out on the basis of a survey and the survey carried out by the addressees on the basis of the opinion of the main audit bodies on the quality and impact of the audits carried out by the Court.
These results ranged from 3.5 to 3.7 on a five-stage scale between 2009 and 2012.
Overall, the results of the evaluations carried out by the addressees in 2009-2012 are positive and show that the Court's main addressees assess the quality and impact of the reports.
The Court shall use its audit experience in particular in the form of recommendations in the reports in order to contribute to the improvement of financial management.
In order to amend the recommendations of the Court, the recommendations of the Court must first be adopted by the evaluation bodies and subsequently implemented.
The court therefore measures both parameters.
100 % 90 % 80 % 94% 2009 94% 2010 93% 2011 Objective 98 % 109 % of the 2012 targets ADOPTED BY THE COURT'S RECOMMENDATION.In 2009-2012, the Court's recommendation was accepted by 93% to 98%.
The target set for this indicator was exceeded annually.
In 2011, the Court started the systematic monitoring of the implementation of its recommendations, given that the implementation of some recommendations may take a long time due to their scale or complexity.
According to the Commission statistics, 63% of the recommendations made between 2009 and 2012 were implemented at the end of 2012.
More than half of the recommendations issued in 2011 were also implemented.

40 EFFINESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF FIGHTING RESOURCES The Court shall assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources, depending on the extent to which it is able to present timely reports and audit reports, fulfil its financial management obligations and ensure the well-being and expertise of its staff.
The Court shall monitor the effectiveness of its reporting procedure by comparing the number of reports for a given year with the number of reports adopted and by verifying that the reports have been adopted within the time limits set for that purpose.
100 % 90 80% 80 % 70 % 79% 2008 91 % 2009 90 % 2010 83% 2011 93 % 103 % Objective 2012 100 % 90 % 80 % 70 % 60 % 73 % 2008 67 % 2009 80 % 2010 Result 75 % 73 % 81 % Objective 103 % Result 75 % 73 % Objective 73 % Objective 70% 70% 60 % 73% 2008 67 % 2009 80 % 2010 Result 75 % 73 % 81 % Objective 81 % Result 75 % Result 79 % - 93% The result was measured from 2008 for the number of reports actually accepted compared to the number of reports originally planned.
The measurement showed that the annual targets were achieved in the majority, but further improvements are possible, in particular in the preparation of special reports.
The punctuality of the reports has also been measured since 2008.
The purpose of the measurement of results is to specify the dates of the annual reports and the specific annual reports set out in the legislation and set out in the planning documents for the special reports.
NUMBER OF REPORTS OF THE COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF THE COURT OF THE YEAR 2011 2012
In the period 2008-2012 the result was 67-73% and was therefore below the 90% target set for this indicator.
The main reasons were the ambitious planning of the special reports and the unpredictable events during the audit.
The Court notes that while the accuracy of the planning of the performance of the tasks and the effectiveness of the performance of the audits can be further improved, it has been possible not only to substantially increase the number of special reports prepared in 2008-2012, but also to bring them closer to the 18-month target.
Between 2008 and 2012 85 special reports were adopted (compared to 51 special reports for 2003-2007) and the average implementation period was reduced from 25 months in 2008 to 20 months in 2012.
The Court's 2013-2017 strategy includes a new initiative to further improve reporting to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of the reports.
THE NEED FOR CONTROL POSITIONS The Court uses audit notifications to confirm the accuracy of the specific findings of the audit by the audited entities.
The audit communications are therefore an important step in the audit process.
In accordance with the Court's internal rules, the notification of the checks should be made within two months of the checks being carried out, each year being measured to the extent to which the time limit has been respected.
70 % 60 % 50 % 40 % 30 % 20% 54% 58% 61 % 90 % of targets 2012 27 % 2008 2009 2010 2011 Result AIM OF THE COURT'S DIRECT CONTROL POINTS 43 % The Court found that significant improvements were needed in drawing up audit notices in relation to punctuality.
In 2008, when the Court started the measurements, it set two targets for the punctuality of the audit notifications: improving efficiency by 10% per year and ensuring that 80% of the audit communications are prepared by the end of 2012.
In the period 2008-2012 the result was 27-61%.
Although the results have improved significantly and the annual targets have been largely achieved, the results in 2012 are still lower than the long-term target of 80%.
The Court will continue to strive to achieve even better results in this area 41.
42 EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Court seeks to obtain a full opinion from an independent auditor on the annual accounts and the use of resources and from the European Parliament on the basis of a positive opinion of the Council.
The opinion was without reservation and examined by an independent auditor who received an opinion from the European Parliament every year without reservation and then granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget.
EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION In accordance with guidelines published by the International Accounting Federation (IFAC), the Court seeks to provide an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training for auditors.

Taking into account language courses, the controller receives an average of 10.6 days of training per year.
Since 2010, the target level of vocational training has been achieved annually.
COOPERATION The Court conducted internal interviews in 2009 and 2012 to assess the satisfaction of its employees.
This study has two indicators: the percentage of employees who are generally satisfied with work and the average level of overall job satisfaction.
A scale of 1 to 4 has been used, each value above 2,5 indicates general satisfaction.
COOPERATION WITH COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION WITH ALL COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION ALL ALL COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION WITH ALL COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION WITH COOPERATION ALL COOPERATION ALL ALL COOPERATION IN ALL COOPERATION IN ALL COOPERATION IN ALL OF THE COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION COOPERATION IN ALL COOPERATION IN 2009 was very similar: 86 % of the workers were generally satisfied with their work and the value of 2.8 was achieved.
The results can therefore be considered as good.
1 43 44 SUPPORT FOR THE CONTROL OF STAFF RESOURCES The Court's most important capital is its staff.
At 31 December 2012, the Court's staff was 887 staff (officials and temporary staff, but without members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
573 of them work in examination chambers (including 123 staff in the study of members).
In 2012, given the objective of the best use of resources, the possibility of increasing efficiency through simplification of procedures was re-examined and implemented in all actions.
The posts released as a result of increased efficiency outside the scope of control were, as far as possible, transferred to the control services and the services of the President.
As a result, since 2008, the number of audit posts has increased by 14.4%, while the total number of posts approved by the Court has increased by only 3.5%.
Production increased significantly over the same period (see page 9).

Moreover, the Court, for a limited number of university graduates, establishes a policy of equal opportunities between men and women, as well as other EU institutions, for human resources management and recruitment.
Following a steady increase in women's participation over the years, the Court has achieved the almost balanced participation of women and men among its employees.
At the end of 2012, the Court adopted an action plan on equal opportunities aimed at achieving a more balanced participation of women and men at all levels of the institution.
In 2012, the Court had 78 staff: 50 officials, 11 temporary staff and 17 contract staff.
Since 2011, the number of job vacancies is almost 3% (28 job vacancies on 31 December 2012).
46 The following graph shows the percentage of men and women at the level of responsibility at 31 December 2012.
In 2012, the percentage of women at AD level reached 40% and is likely to continue to increase in the future, as the last recruitment waves in the AD5-AD8 recruitment groups represent 46% of the workforce.
Of the 69 directors and heads of departments, 21 women (30%) are women, reflecting the development of recent years.
Most of them are busy with the Translation Directorate and the administrative services.

EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION The profession of examiner requires continuous training to keep pace with new changes and acquire new skills.
Moreover, due to the specific nature of the Court's audit environment, auditors need good knowledge of foreign languages.
In 2012, the Court's staff (researchers and other staff) completed an average of 8 days of vocational training (9.3 days in 2011).
Language courses accounted for 52% of the total number of training days (compared with 54% in 2011).
Translation is a supporting action to support checks that enable the Court to carry out its mission and to achieve its communication objectives.
In 2012, the value of translations reached a maximum of 158 861 pages, i.e. 11% higher than in 2011.
More than 99% of translations were completed on time.
Information technologies play a key role in the efficiency and efficiency of the Court.
2012 was a successful year: a first version of the new control support instrument (ASYST2) of the Court was created in the field of knowledge management and a pilot phase was launched in the control department.
In addition, improvements were made in the content of training in 2012 and new courses were developed in order to adapt to the audit priorities.
Moreover, the creation of a new electronic system and the development of e-learning have made it possible to manage training activities more effectively.
The Translation Directorate did not only provide linguistic support in inspections in the Member States, but also in the subsequent stages of drawing up the audit reports.
It also supported INTOSAI working groups and met other specific needs related to the Court's audit activities. the automation of administrative processes was actively continued by the introduction of the ECAdema supporting the Court's training policy, by decentralising the control of time by which human resources were spared and by fully digitising the personal files.
The new building was also connected with the new telephone system and the data network 47.
48 MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE In 2012, the Directorate for Finance and Support Services continued to provide: (a) adequate resources, services and infrastructure for the fulfilment of strategic objectives and objectives, and (b) provide the necessary funding, internal control and accounting mechanisms to support all of the Court's activities.
In 2003, a second extension building was commissioned to ensure a safe, comfortable and ergonomic working environment for the Court's staff and to ensure that all the Court's staff work in one place.
In November 2012, the hostel closed down the building and the first move took place before the end of the year.

50 In 2012, the total budget was 96%.
For Title 1, this indicator is 96%, with the lowest in Chapter 14 (Other external staff and services) and in Article 162 (service travel) of Chapter 16 (Other expenditure related to members and staff of the institution) (92%).
For Title 2, the average performance ratio is 99%.
The amount of payments under Chapter 20 (buildings) depends on the work on the construction of the second enlargement of the Court (building K3).
The fourth financial tranche of EUR 3 million for this project was entered in the 2012 budget and entered in the 2012 budget and partly paid in 2012.
The remaining amount of funds allocated to building K3 was transferred to 2013 and is intended to finance contracts awarded to construction companies by the project manager on behalf of the Court.
The total cost of building K3 is estimated at EUR 79 million to be financed over the next five years: EUR 55 million in 2009, EUR 11 million in 2010, EUR 7 million in 2011 and EUR 6 million in 2012 and 2013.
The 2013 budget increased slightly by 0.2% compared to 2012.

52 THE COURT'S AUDIT AND EXTERNAL AUDIT The Court's annual accounts shall be audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important example of the Court's application of the same principles of transparency and accountability as those of the authorities it has carried out.
The auditor's opinion, PricewaterhouseCoopers SRL on the Court's annual accounts for the financial year 2011 was published2 in October 2012.
In our view, the annual accounts present a true and fair view of the financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2011 and of the financial situation and cash flows at the end of that period, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of the accounting rules of the European Union (EC) No 1605/2002) as regards the principle of the abolition of fees and the control procedures, of which, in all relevant respects and taking into account the above-mentioned assessment criteria, (b) the control procedures introduced do not give the necessary assurance that the financial operations have been carried out in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.

Done at Luxembourg, 7 March 2013. Eduardo Ruiz García Secretary-General
54 35 YEARS IN THE YEARS OF THE BETTER EU FUNCTIONS The European Court of Auditors has been an external auditor of the EU for 35 years, which has constantly added value to the Union's financial management and provides public responsibility for the use of taxpayers' money.
The Court was founded at a time when the European Community (the original European Union) developed towards greater democracy and greater responsibility towards its citizens.
Two particularly important steps are to extend the powers of the European Parliament to budgetary control and to fully finance the European Community budget from own resources.
The Community has recognised that it needs an independent external auditor who has helped Parliament and the Council to ensure democratic financial control.
Heinrich Aigner, President of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, who, since 1973, has strongly supported an external audit body at Community level, has come across an initiative which led to the creation of the European Court of Auditors under the Brussels Treaty on 22 July 1975.
The Court started its activity in October 1977 with its seat in Luxembourg.
The President of the Court Hans Kußer then found the Court to be the financial conscience of the community.
On 1 November 1993, after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the Court obtained the status of a fully-fledged European institution, which guarantees its independence and independence as an equivalent institution.
The Maastricht Treaty has also implemented, which is now the main product of the Court, namely the statement of assurance (DAS) of the EU accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The role of the Court was strengthened with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999, in which the Court's independence was strengthened and its control powers extended to other policy areas.
The Nice Treaty of 1 February 2003 confirmed the principle that the Court should belong to one member of each Member State, also stressed the importance of the Court's cooperation with the national audit authorities and enabled the Court to establish the structure of the chambers.
Since its establishment, the Court has consistently supported cooperation with the highest audit authorities of the Member States in the control of EU funds, in particular through the participation of EU-ORKB Chairs in the Contact Committee.
As part of the ORKB role, the Court also sought to prepare the development of public sector control by cooperating with other ORKBs within the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their regional EUROSAI group to define technical standards and best practices.
The Court took note of the peer review procedure at an early stage as a tool for the development and dissemination of best practices in the Community in the framework of the ORKB.
Over 35 years, the Court has sought to improve the EU's financial management by providing high-quality products reflecting changes in the EU and the changing needs of its addressees.
Over the last 35 years, the EU has adopted new Member States, has acquired new powers and has set up new institutions at EU level, and all of these countries have had to take account of their work.
As a result, the Court's results have increased significantly in comparison with the two opinions drawn up by the Court in the first year of its activities.
The Court's products now include annual reports, special reports, statements of assurance, special annual reports, opinions and position documents.
The number of products has increased to 87 publications in 2012.
For several years, the Court has given a higher priority to monitoring the results of EU policies and to providing guidance to improve cost-effectiveness.
Like the EU, the Court has developed.
On the basis of nine members and 120 employees in 1977, the Court currently has 27 members and almost 900 employees.
Like the Union itself, the success of the Court depends on close cooperation between members and workers from all European countries.
The Court is proud of the fact that since 1977 it has built seconded, professional and experienced staff that is responsible for protecting the financial interests of citizens.
In the coming years, the Court will seek to increase the responsibility towards citizens for the resources to achieve the objectives pursued.

To commemorate our colleague, Henrik Otbo, a member of the Court, who died unexpectedly on 1 February 2015, Henrik Otbo was born in 1949 and was Danish.
From 1995 to 2012 he was the President of the Danish Court of Auditors and from 1 March 2012 he was a member of the European Court of Auditors in the CEAD Chamber (coordination, evaluation, quality assurance and development) with special responsibility for development and evaluation of audit.
His commitment to public financial control throughout his life, in particular his leading role in setting international standards for the highest audit bodies as president of the INTOSAI Committee on Technical Standards, was particularly valuable to the Court, his former colleagues from the Danish Court of Auditors and the whole audit sector.

The President's foreword 04 Dear Reader, 2014 was a year of profound change for the EU and its finances.
The EU has entrusted the European Central Bank with responsibility for the supervision of large banks in the euro area.
This was the first year of the new multiannual financial framework relevant for the implementation of the EU budget for the period 2014-2020.
The new elections of the European Parliament and the renewal of the highest positions in the Council and the European Commission were also of particular importance and the six new members of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) were welcomed.
In 2014, our body issued 91 reports, opinions and other products, more than ever before.
They are the result of our accounting audits, compliance audits and performance audits, including audits, which are part of our new competences in the field of financial and economic governance.
They contain a number of important proposals, proposals and recommendations for improving EU financial management and accountability for the 2014-2020 programming period.
Some of its main statements are contained in this annual activity report.
We are also trying to provide our addressees with the broadest possible knowledge of the main challenges facing the EU in terms of funding and implementation of policies, based on our experience in the field of control.
To this end, in 2014, we introduced a new product called "Landscape Analysis" in 2014 in order to help this period.
In addition, at the request of the European Parliament, we have published an overview of the results of our accounting and compliance checks in the field of agriculture and cohesion in the period 2009-2013.
The Court also cooperates with its addressees to ensure that the addressees can make the most of the results of their work.
In 2014, the Court appointed, inter alia, the member responsible for institutional relations and the Ombudsman.
It also organised several events to ensure that information can be exchanged with high-level stakeholders from the EU and Member States.
During the conference, a number of those responsible for the management and control of EU funds, including Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission, met the highest control bodies and representatives of the scientific community.
The European Parliament's Vice-President and former EU Commissioner, Commissioner Olli Rehn, gave an introductory speech.
Particular attention should be paid to the visit of the delegation of the members of the Court to Lithuania, where the meetings took place with Members of Parliament, members of the Government and representatives of the national Court of Auditors and with the Lithuanian Central Bank.
Preface by President 05 All year round, our strategy for 2013-2017 was crucial for our work and for our efforts to reform our institution.
In 2014, we shortened the average time needed to prepare our special reports and reduced the number of our employees in line with the requirements of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
We have also put measures in place to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the future by introducing an internal reform project.
The project will coordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the internal working groups and the recommendations of the independent external peer review of our economic evaluation and of the European Parliament report on the future role of the Court.
The Court is based in Luxembourg, but our teams, as part of their work to obtain proof of control, travel where EU funds are spent.
This activity report shall include an overview of the inspection visits and the reports we are preparing.
Particular emphasis will be placed on our assessment of EU support for European airport infrastructure.
This is an example of our performance audits in order to assess the impact and added value of EU funding and shows what efforts the Court needs to make in order to carry out its mission.
Furthermore, this audit demonstrates the commitment and professionalism of the members of the Court, on which the Court and its citizens, in their interest, can always leave.

Our management • In 2014, the Court welcomed six new members: Alex Brennankmeijer, Danièle Lamarque, Nikolaos Millionis, Phil Wynn Owen, Klaus-Heiner Lehne and Oskar Herics.
The College of Members - Vítor Caldeira, elected for the third period of three years - once again as President of the Court and appointed Ville Itälä as the member responsible for institutional relations. • The Court's 2013-2017 strategy stimulated changes in the organisation: the Court introduced an internal reform project aimed at improving the control process and ensuring a more flexible organisation of resources. • Further improving administrative efficiency, based on simplification of procedures and the transfer of staff in support services to the control department.
An action plan on equal opportunities has also been put in place.

Our activities 07 Audit reports and other products The three main products of the European Court of Auditors are: • Annual reports are: • Annual reports of checks and checks on compliance with the European Union budget and the European Development Fund (EDF).
This includes special annual reports on agencies, decentralised agencies and EU Joint Undertakings. • Special reports, which may be published at any time during the year, together with the results of the audits of the agencies, decentralised agencies and EU Joint Undertakings selected by them in specific budgetary areas or management issues.
These are mainly economic audits. • Opinions on new or amended acts affecting financial financing and other products based on an analysis made at the request of another institution or on the Court's own initiative.
In 2014, the Court developed more products than ever before and presented new products.
Numerous analytical information is still available as part of the annual evaluation as well as extensive information on the results of our annual audits on accounting and compliance audits.
In 2014, more emphasis was placed on cost-efficiency audits, so that EU budgetary authorities received additional information on the quality of EU budget implementation.
In addition to the annual reports, for the first time, we have published a summary of our audit results for agricultural and cohesion expenditure, which are subject to shared management in the period 2009-2013, in order to ensure a multi-annual perspective.
Their important development was a new product called Landscape analysis.
The Landscape analysis will provide information and analysis on key issues based on our audit expertise.
In 2014, we published two Landscape analyses: the first one focuses on the main challenges facing the EU, taking into account public responsibility and control, and the second one focuses on the risks related to EU financial management.

Our activities 08 Audit visits in 2014. While most of the examination work is in our premises in Luxembourg, our auditors also carry out inspection visits to the authorities of the Member States, to other beneficiaries of EU funds (including the headquarters of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation in Switzerland) and to EU agencies and agencies.
The purpose of these visits is to obtain direct proof of control from the bodies involved in the approval, management and payment of EU funds and from the relevant final beneficiaries.
Our teams of controllers usually consist of two to three controllers, and the duration of the verification visit is several days to two weeks, depending on the type of exam and the distance.
In the EU, our audit visits are often carried out in consultation with the highest audit authorities in the Member States visited.
The frequency and intensity of the audit work in each Member State and in the beneficiary countries depends on the type of control and the results of the selection of the sample.
The number and duration of inspection visits may therefore vary from country to country and from year to year.
In 2014, the Court's auditors spent 4,915 days on on-the-spot checks in the Member States and outside the EU and obtained evidence that annual reports and selected audit tasks (annual reports).
They also spent a lot of time in the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg and in decentralised agencies and agencies across the EU.
In 2014, our auditors used less days on on-the-spot checks than in previous years.
This is due to more effective working procedures and the increasing use of technologies such as video conferencing.
EU inspectors used EU controllers to control maritime transport equipment.

Our actions 10 Annual Implementation Report for the EU budget for the financial year 2013 Most of the audits carried out by the Court in 2014 were devoted to the implementation of the EU budget for 2013.
The 2013 annual report, which was produced as a result of this work, was published on 5 November 2014 and presented to our addressees, including the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the EU (Council of Ecofin and Financial Financial) and the European Parliament and governments, as well as to the media.
The annual report aims to assist the European Parliament, the Council and citizens in assessing the quality of the EU's financial management through the presentation of findings and conclusions.
The 20th Annual Statement of Assurance (2013) on the reliability of the EU accounts and the regularity of the underlying transactions is the main element of the 2013 Annual Report.
This report contains even more information on the cost-effectiveness of EU spending and on the Commission's report on the results.
Estimated error rate in the EU budget: 4.7% at the time of the 2013 annual report to the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.
Our actions 11 Key conclusions in the 2013 Annual Report The EU Court delivered an opinion on the reliability of the European Union accounts for 2013.
The 2013 revenue was generally legal and regular, including with respect to commitments. ο Payments for 2013 were to a large extent burdened with errors.
The Court therefore issued an incomplete opinion on legality and regularity.
This figure is close to the 2012 error rate (4,8%) and is constantly above the materiality threshold of 2%. ο The most defective of these two expenditure areas were: regional policy, transport and energy, with an estimated error rate of 6,9% and rural development, the environment, fisheries and health, with an estimated error rate of 6,7%.
The total estimated level of error in shared management was 5.2%. ο Overall, the level of regularity of payments in the Member States was partly effective with significant divergences between Member States in the analysis of supervisory and control systems.
As in 2012, in the case of a large proportion of the errors in shared management areas, Member States' authorities had sufficient information to detect and correct errors before submitting a proposal to the Commission. ο Recovery and recovery of funds by Member States' authorities and the Commission had a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
Without these measures, the estimated overall return on investment would be 6.3%. ο Using EU funds for the 2007-2013 programming period meant absorption (use it or lose it in case of non-use) and compliance and not good results.
This lack of focus on results is a key weakness in the way a large part of the EU budget is built.

Our actions 13 Agriculture and cohesion: the review of EU expenditure in 2007-2013 for the first time, in parallel with the annual reports in the 23 official EU languages, the Court has published a document in order to provide a multi-annual perspective on the expenditure on which the statement of assurance is based in two main areas of expenditure: agriculture and cohesion.
He drew conclusions on the problems with EU financial management and control over the last spending period, summarised the results of the audit and presented the challenges of the new spending period 2014-2020.
In addition, in this context, the European Parliament has expressed its wish for information on shared management in the various countries. ο Main assumptions: ο With the exception of direct aid and market support for farmers in the agricultural sector, the pressure on the use of funds is a key aspect of the risk associated with expenditure under shared management. ο The main risks to the regularity of agricultural expenditure are that the areas, animals or costs on which aid payments are based are not eligible, the beneficiaries of the aid do not fulfil the conditions and are not fully calculated.
Infringements of agri-environment requirements, specific requirements for investment projects and public procurement rules are important factors for increasing the risk of rural development expenditure. ο The greatest risks associated with cohesion expenditure are cases of breaches of EU or national public procurement rules.
The second biggest risk is that expenditure (or projects) is not eligible for EU funding. ο Although control systems need to be significantly improved, the biggest challenge is to take action to simplify the management of the programmes.
The Court finds errors in all EU Member States.
Despite improvements in the reporting of risks and errors by Member States' authorities, the Commission continues to have considerable difficulties in ensuring the reliability of this information. ο Amendments to the new programming period regulations may not have a significant impact on the level of risk. ο Despite improvements in the reporting of risks and errors, the Commission continues to have considerable difficulties in ensuring the reliability of this information. ο Amendments to the new programming period regulations may not have a significant impact on the level of risk.
Our actions 14 The 2013 Annual Report on the European Development Fund (EDF) is funded by the EU Member States and is managed outside the EU general budget.
The European Commission is responsible for the financial management of actions financed by the EFF.
Within the framework of the EDF, the European Union grants funds for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) under the Cotonou Agreement of 2000.
Expenditure is aimed at reducing poverty and reducing it at the end, in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP and OCT countries into the world economy.
The agreement is based on three complementary pillars: development cooperation, economic and trade cooperation and the political dimension.
The Court's 2013 Annual Report on the EDF was published on 5 November 2014 as an annual report on the EU budget.
It contains the 20th EDF Statement of Assurance.
The Court found that the 2013 annual accounts constitute the appropriate financial and financial situation of the EDF, the results of its operations and cash flows and the change of net assets as a whole.
The Court estimated the error rate for EDF expenditure for the financial year 2013 at 3,4%, an increase of 3,0% compared to 2012.
Specific annual reports for the financial year 2013 In 2014, the Court prepared and published 51 annual reports for the financial year 2013.
The reports concerned 41 decentralised EU institutions, executive agencies and agencies, seven EU Joint Undertakings active in research and the European Central Bank, European Schools and communication infrastructure Sisnet.
The Court also published two reports summing up the results of its annual audits for the financial year 2013, one of the EU agencies and other bodies, the other of the joint undertakings active in the field of research.
These two summaries of analysis and comparisons were submitted to the President of the European Parliament, the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, the General Affairs Council and the Council's Committee on Budgets.
Together with the specific annual reports, these reports are available on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu).
EU agencies, bodies and joint undertakings are prepared on the basis of EU legislation to carry out specific tasks and are established throughout the European Union.
They operate in many areas such as safety, health, research, finance, migration and travel.
Each of them has one mandate, one board, one director, one staff and one budget.
While financial risks are relatively low for agencies, bodies and joint enterprises, for the entire EU budget, the reputation risk is high in the EU as they are clearly visible in the Member States and have a significant impact on policy-making, decision-making and programme implementation in areas that are crucial for European citizens.
51 Special annual reports per year
Our actions 15 The Court gave 41 agencies and other institutions full opinions on the reliability of the accounts in 2013.
The underlying transactions were legal and legal for all agencies and other bodies, with the exception of two in all relevant respects, and for the EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) and Frontex (European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union), the Court issued an opinion with limited liability.
Moreover, in 2013, accounting was reliable for all seven Joint Undertakings, but the Court issued a limited opinion for the three Joint Undertakings on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying their annual accounts: Artemis (integrated ICT systems), ENIAC (nanoelectronics) and IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative).
As regards European schools, the Court was not able to conclude whether there was a significant inappropriate presentation in 2013, as there are still shortcomings in accounting and control in schools.
The Court examined the way the European Central Bank uses its carbon footprint and concluded that, although the Bank has taken action to reduce the negative impact of its administrative activities on the environment, further action and action are needed.
Special reports adopted in 2014. In addition to annual reports and special annual reports, the Court shall publish, throughout the year, special reports containing the results of economic control and compliance checks in respect of the budgetary areas of its choice or management issues.
In selecting and shaping audit tasks, the Court seeks to achieve the maximum impact and to maximise the use of its resources.
The Court takes into account the following factors in the selection of the subjects: • the risk of irregularities or irregularities in terms of efficiency in the area of expenditure or policy area; • the potential for added value following the Court's audit; • the political and public interest. 24 Special Reports in 2014.

Our actions 17 Smart and Inclusive Growth Smart and Inclusive Growth covers two areas: competitiveness for growth and jobs: research and innovation, education and training, trans-European energy, transport and telecommunications networks, social policy, business development, etc., EU measures for growth and jobs for 2014-2020 amount to EUR 142 billion and 13% of the EU's total budget respectively.
Economic, social and territorial cohesion includes regional policy aimed at helping the least developed EU countries and regions to establish contacts with other regions, with a view to strengthening the competitiveness of all regions and developing cooperation between them.
The EU's cohesion funding for 2014-2020 amounts to EUR 367 billion and 34% of the EU budget at current prices respectively.
In 2014, the Court drew up the following special reports in this area: • Effectiveness of EU-funded public transport projects (No 1/2014) In this special report, the Court assessed the implementation and effectiveness of public transport projects co-financed by the EU Structural Funds in order to determine whether the projects met the needs of users and achieved their objectives.
The audit showed that two thirds of the projects in the field of transport co-financed by the EU Structural Funds have not been sufficiently used.
This development was mainly due to shortcomings in the project concept and insufficient mobility policy.
However, these insufficient results were generally not monitored by project promoters or by national authorities.
Most projects were based on infrastructure and vehicle structures according to project specifications.
Significant delays and excess costs were found, but almost all the projects audited were in line with the needs of the users.
European cities must increase mobility and reduce congestion, accidents and pollution through local mobility strategies.
As part of the co-financed projects, the city received support in the development of urban transport systems such as metro, trams and buses.
Trams and buses are important means of public transport.
Our actions 18 • Have cohesion policy funds for renewable energy production produced good results?
(6/2014 No) in this special report, the Court examined whether good results were achieved in this period from two main sources of funding to promote renewable energy sources under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (FS) in order to check whether these funds had been adequately prioritised, cost-effective and mature in renewable energy production projects, in order to achieve meaningful objectives, and to what extent these funds had achieved good results in order to achieve the EU 2020 renewable energy target.
The audit concluded that improvements were needed to ensure that EU funding could contribute as much as possible to this objective.
The projects audited provided results according to the plan and most of the projects were well-developed and ready to be implemented at the time of selection.
No significant cost overruns or delays were observed and the production capacity of renewable energy was installed as planned and launched as planned.
However, energy production results have not always been achieved or have not been properly measured.
The total effectiveness of the use of funds was limited as cost-effectiveness in project planning and implementation was not a guiding principle and expenditure had limited added value in the EU.
The EU Council has set a binding EU target of 20% of the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020.

(No (In this special report, the Court examined whether the funders co-financed by the ERDF successfully supported start-ups with high growth potential.
The audit concluded that the EU made a significant financial contribution to the creation of incubator centres infrastructure, in particular in Member States where such support to businesses is relatively rare.
However, the results of the founders' centres examined were not sufficient.
In view of the financial constraints and the limited scope of the business start-up activities, the provision of business-related services was rather limited.
This situation was mainly due to the lack of expertise in seed support procedures and the shortcomings in management systems.
Founding centres aim to support new businesses in their creation and further development.
Support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has become an increasingly political priority over time.
For the period 2007-2013, EU expenditure in this area amounted to EUR 38 billion.

Our actions 19 • Is the ERDF effective in financing projects aimed at the direct promotion of biodiversity in the framework of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020?
(No 12/2014) In this special report, the Court examined whether the ERDF funds available for direct support for biodiversity were used by the Member States.
The audit showed that Member States are lagging behind using ERDF resources to finance projects compared to other areas of ERDF expenditure.
In order for the ERDF to continue to be a useful tool for the implementation of the EU Strategy to reduce biodiversity loss by 2020, the Commission should further support Member States in the implementation of specific conservation and management plans for habitats and natural species.
Projects co-financed were broadly in line with biodiversity priorities at national and EU level.
However, the assessment of the effectiveness of these projects has been undermined by the fact that most Member States have not added performance indicators or monitoring systems to assess the development of natural habitats and species.
The protection of biodiversity is one of the EU's key priorities.
After the 2010 target of reducing the loss of biodiversity in Europe had not been reached, the Council approved a new strategy by 2020, in which direct support for biodiversity and nature conservation for the 2007-2013 programming period was earmarked for ERDF support of EUR 2.8 billion. • Has the ERDF support for SMEs in the e-commerce sector been effective?
(No 20/2014) In this special report, the Court assesses whether operational programmes provide a good basis for effective support for e-commerce activities for SMEs, whether the managing authorities have correctly selected and monitored e-commerce projects, and whether projects co-financed by the ERDF have been successfully implemented and provide tangible benefits.
The Court found that ERDF support for SMEs in the e-commerce sector supported the purchase and sale of goods via the Internet in order to increase the availability of services to businesses on the Internet.
However, due to the lack of monitoring, it was impossible to assess the extent to which ERDF support contributed to the achievement of the IT objectives of the Member States and the EU.
Insufficient procedures for the selection of Member States lead to an apparent error in the cost/benefit ratio for many projects.
The programme managers focused more on the use of resources (outputs) than on the achievement of results.
The Commission supports e-commerce through its action programme for Europe.Within the ERDF budget 2007-2013, €3 billion has been allocated to SMEs for the better use of ICT.The Court's video on Special Report No 20/2014.Is the ERDF effective in funding projects aimed at direct support of biodiversity in the EU's 2020 Biodiversity Strategy? in the framework of the EU Biodiversity Strategy?The Court's video on Special Report No 20/2014.
Our actions 20 Approaching economic control: EU-funded airport infrastructure: no cost/benefit ratio (No 21/2014) Closed part of the oversized terminal at Fuerteventura airport.
While EU aviation policy aims to address capacity problems in the EU to build additional infrastructure, to make better use of existing structures, to optimise airport services and to better connect with other modes of transport in Europe, it will not be able to meet much of this demand due to the lack of airport and ground infrastructure.
There are more than 500 airports in Europe, with more than one million employees directly or indirectly employed, and more than EUR 140 billion, together with airlines, contribute to Europe's economic performance.
Airport infrastructure projects are an important area of expenditure in the EU budget: in the period 2000-2013, around €4.5 billion was allocated to EU projects of this type, of which over €2.8 billion was allocated to cohesion policy funds.
As part of the economic control of this support, the Court examined whether the investments were properly needed, whether the time and cost framework were respected in the framework of the construction projects and whether the newly built or upgraded infrastructure was fully used.
The Court assessed whether the investments led to an increase in the number of passengers and improved after-sales services and whether the supported airports were financially stable.
The auditors carried out their work between May 2013 and October 2014, in particular in respect of 20 airports in Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain financed by EU funds.
In total, over EUR 600 million of the EU was allocated to these airports between 2000 and 2013.
The team reviewed the relevant legislation, air traffic planning in five Member States and the publication of the main interbranch organisations.
In particular, the auditors visited 20 airports to assess the results, use, results and effects, as well as the economic situation of airports, as well as to obtain direct evidence that they come from EU funds.
The Court found that the cost-benefit ratio for EU-funded investments at airports was not consistent.
Too many airports, often close to each other, have received financial support for similar infrastructures, and in many cases, the infrastructure has become too extensive.
Only half of the airports audited managed to increase the number of passengers.
No measurement of the improvement in customer service or regional socio-economic benefits such as the creation of additional jobs has been made or no evidence has been provided.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission concludes that, since the airport in Lubeca is located at the same airport in Lubeca, the airport in Lubeca is not located at the same airport in the same area as the airport in Lubeca, in which the airport in Lubeca is located in the area where the airport in Lubeca is located in the area where the airport in Lubeca is located in the area where the airport in Lubeca is located in the area where the airport in Lubeca is not located in the same area as the airport in Lubece is located in the area in which the airport in Lubece is located.
For most airports, the audit team noted significant delays in the construction and construction of the infrastructure.
For almost half of airports, costs were exceeded, which means that Member States had to pay almost EUR 100 million more of their national budgets than originally planned.
Our actions 21 Funding was not well coordinated by the Member States: in most countries there was no strategic long-term airport development plan.
The Commission also did not fully monitor the financing which is not known at all to airports which receive or are concerned by the financing.
In this way, it will not have a full picture of all EU investments in airports and will have limited opportunities to ensure monitoring and to ensure that the strategy is properly developed and implemented.
On the basis of these findings, the Court recommended to the Commission that, from the 2014-2020 programming period, Member States should apply EU measures only to airport infrastructure that is financially viable and the investment needs of which have been adequately assessed and demonstrated.
Another recommendation was that Member States should have coherent airport development plans at regional, national and transnational level, in order to avoid excessive capacity, duplication and uncoordinated investments in airport infrastructure.
In its reply, the Commission ensured that lessons were learned from these experiences.
The Commission has therefore ensured that a different approach will be applied substantially in the relevant provisions of the 2014-2020 programming period.
The report was presented to the European Parliament, which fully supports the Court's conclusions and recommendations.
The publication of the report was of great interest to the media.
The media response was greatest in Spain, but it also included headlines in major international newspapers, television broadcasts and social media.

Our actions 22 Sustainable growth: EU natural resources are politically responsible for agriculture and rural development, fisheries and the environment.
The planned budget for 2014-2020 is EUR 420 billion and 39% of the EU budget at current prices.
Three quarters of the expenditure concerns direct payments to farmers and support the agricultural markets through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF) through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF) through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF) through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EGF) the strongest pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The next fifth part of the expenditure concerns EU support for rural development financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the second pillar of the CAP.
Agriculture and rural development shall be managed jointly by the Commission and the Member States.
In 2014, the Court drew up the following special reports in this area: • Inclusion of EU water policy objectives in the CAP: partial achievement (No 4/2014) in this special report The Court assessed whether the objectives of EU water policy were successfully integrated into the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The audit showed that the EU can only partially achieve the objectives of water policy within the CAP.
Two instruments for integrating water-related issues (respect for cross-compliance and rural development) are insufficient and the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is characterised by fluctuations and weaknesses.
The CAP instruments have so far had a positive impact on supporting policy objectives to improve water quantity and quality.
However, these instruments are limited compared to the ambitious objectives of the CAP.
For example, none of these two instruments allows the "polluter pays" principle to be fully applied to CAP spending.
Moreover, at the level of the EU institutions and Member States, there is insufficient knowledge of and the development of the burden of water resources arising from agricultural activities.
The EU attaches great importance to the protection of European water resources.
Agriculture, one of the largest consumers and polluting water resources, plays a key role in sustainable water management.
The CAP allocates almost 40% of the EU budget (over EUR 50 billion for 2014) and the EU CAP seeks to influence agricultural procedures affecting water resources.
Our actions 23 • Did the Commission effectively manage the integration of coupled support into the single payment scheme?
(No (8/2014)) In this special report, the Court assessed how well the Commission, following the 2008 CAP Health Check, incorporated EU production-related support (e.g. for the areas for which it was managed or for which it was for animals) into the single payment scheme into the single payment scheme.
The audit showed that the Commission did not adequately monitor over the period 2010-2012 how Member States calculated the payment entitlements of farmers under EU farm support under the single payment scheme.
Although most Member States have correctly used the reference data of farmers, there have been serious shortcomings in the correct application of the rules and calculation rules.
The Commission has not used its mandate to ensure that the criteria for the allocation of available support are always in line with EU rules, are in line with the principle of sound financial management and do not have a potential impact on market conditions.
Within the framework established by the Commission, it was not clear enough what checks should be carried out by the Member States and the Member States' control systems varied in quality, and the main objective of the single payment scheme was to shift the orientation of the CAP from market support to support non-productive income for farmers: farmers' owners should be able to adapt their production to market demand and their income should be balanced.
The single payment scheme introduced so far in 18 Member States accounts for 54% of the total EU budget for agriculture and rural development. • Is EU support for investment and promotion in the wine sector well managed and is there evidence that EU wine is competitive?
(9/2014 No) ) In its special report, the Court assessed whether investment and promotion activities had been adequately developed and examined the available monitoring and evaluation data to determine whether the Commission and the Member States had achieved the desired results effectively.
The audit concluded that the management of support for investment and promotion in the wine sector was affected by design and implementation defects and that the impact on the competitiveness of EU wines could not always be demonstrated.
Investment activities specifically targeted at the wine sector are not justified as support is already provided under the EU's rural development policy.
EU support for the promotion of wines has often served to consolidate existing markets rather than to create new or to recover old markets.
The impact of the investment action cannot be easily separated from the investment for rural development.
The EU is the world's largest wine producer.
EU support is aimed at increasing competitiveness and ensuring a better balance between supply and demand.
Between 2009 and 2013, Member States spent EUR 522 million on promotion and EUR 518 million on investment activities.
Between 2014 and 2018, the measures granted to the Member States under this measure increased significantly.
Our actions 24 • Effectiveness of aquaculture support (No 10/2014) from the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) of this special report The Court assessed whether aquaculture support actions were well designed and implemented at both EU and Member State level and whether the EFF achieved an appropriate cost-benefit ratio and whether sustainable development of aquaculture was supported.
The audit showed that by 2013 aquaculture support measures were not well developed and implemented at EU and Member State level, that the EFF did not provide an adequate cost/benefit ratio and did not provide effective support for the sustainable development of aquaculture.
The current framework was not adequate to achieve the EU's objectives for the sustainable development of aquaculture and the results were insufficient.
Actions to promote the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Member States have not been well designed and implemented.
The Member States' national strategic plans and operational programmes were not clear enough and Member States did not have a coherent strategy for this sector.
In many cases, EDF funds were not adequately targeted for aquaculture projects, and the audit showed that these projects were not generally either the expected results or the good results in terms of costs and benefits.
Every year aquaculture produces 1.3 million tonnes of fish in the EU, with a turnover of EUR 4 billion.
One of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for the period up to 2013 was to promote the sustainable development of aquaculture.
By May 2013, more than €400 million were earmarked under the EFF to finance productive investment and environmental and health measures in aquaculture. • Economic economy: the EFF maintained control of the cost of EU funding for rural development projects (No 22/2014) in this Special Report, the Court examined whether the approach taken by the Commission and the Member States was the most effective in controlling the costs of rural development aid.
The audit showed that EU Member States could achieve significant savings in aid for rural development projects while at the same time achieving a more efficient use of resources.
Auditors have identified feasible and cost-effective approaches that could be applied more widely to Member States' control of the costs of rural development aid.
The Member States' control systems were intended to control the prices of the goods or works referred to in the aid applications without having to pay equal attention to whether the same goods were measured.
Some price controls were time-consuming or did not provide sufficient assurance that the approved costs were appropriate.
At the beginning of the programming period, the Commission did not provide sufficient guidance or ensure the dissemination of inadequate procedures.
It did not ensure the effectiveness of Member States' systems before the aid was granted on a large scale.
About half of the EU's rural development expenditure of EUR 100 billion for the period 2007-2013 was implemented in the form of grants for investment projects and other projects implemented by farmers, agricultural enterprises, associations and local authorities.
Our actions 25 • Errors in rural development expenditure: What are the causes and actions for removing them?
(No 23/2014) In this special report, the Court examined the compliance with existing legislation and other legislation on the implementation of rural development and identified the main reasons for the high level of error in this area.
The audit showed that most of the errors in rural development policy are due to a breach of the conditions laid down at Member State level.
Member States' control authorities could and should have detected and corrected most of the errors in rural development investment activities.
Member States' control systems are insufficient as controls are not exhaustive and are based on insufficient information.
The average error rate in rural development expenditure over the last three years was 8.2%.
The errors in the investment activities represented two thirds of the error rate and the area aid represented one third of the error rate.
Only 16 percent of errors were due to non-compliance directly with EU regulations, while most were due to non-compliance with the conditions set at Member State level.
During the 2007-2013 programming period, the EU and the Member States have allocated more than EUR 150 billion to rural development policy, which has been used in almost equal parts for investment and area aid.
• Is EU aid to prevent and mitigate forest damage due to natural disasters and natural disasters well managed?
(No 24/2014) In this special report, the Court assessed whether the support measures of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for forest recovery and the introduction of prevention measures (measure 226) had been well managed and whether the Commission and the Member States could demonstrate that the objectives of the aid had been achieved in a cost-effective manner.
The audit showed that EU funding to prevent forest fires and rebuild forests affected by natural disasters and fires has not been properly managed.
The Commission and the Member States are not fully aware that the intended funding results have been achieved in a cost-effective manner.
Over the past 30 years, fires in the EU have destroyed on average 480,000 hectares of forest in the last 30 years.
Preventive actions accounted for more than 80% of EU funds of €1.5 million for the period 2007-2013.
Our actions 26 Security and citizenship This policy area has been established to ensure the free movement of persons and to ensure a high level of protection for citizens.
It covers from the management of the EU's external borders to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, as well as asylum and immigration policy, police cooperation and the fight against crime.
Expenditure in this area is expected to reach EUR 18 million in 2014-2020 or less than 2% of the total budget.
In 2014, the Court drew up the following special reports in this area: • Conclusions from the development by the European Commission (No 3/2014) of the SIS II Information System (SIS II) In this special report, the Court examined why the Commission, more than six years later than planned, provided SIS II with eight times the costs initially foreseen.
It was examined whether there was a stable business principle throughout the duration of the project in SIS II which took into account significant changes in costs and expected benefits.
The audit concluded that delays and excessive costs were caused by shortcomings in the Commission's management.
The original deadline was unrealistic and the Commission was not able to effectively manage the main development order before 2009.
The actual level of investment needed was clearly underestimated in the initial cost estimates.
The total cost of SIS II amounted to EUR 189 million, which initially corresponds to the estimated amount of EUR 23 million.
The Commission has not fully demonstrated that SIS II provides its best cost/cost ratio.
However, the Commission has learned lessons from the first stage of the project and has already used them for other major IT projects.
The Schengen Information System is used by border, police, customs, visa and judicial authorities throughout the Schengen area.
It shall contain information (s) concerning persons potentially involved in a serious crime or persons who do not have the right to enter or stay in the EU.
• The External Borders Fund has contributed to increasing financial solidarity, but the evaluation of results needs to be improved and added value for the EU (No 15/2014) • In this special report, the Court assessed the effectiveness and added value of the EU for the External Borders Fund and assessed to what extent the objectives of the co-financed projects and programmes have been achieved.
The audit showed that the External Borders Fund contributed to the management of the EU's external borders and to increased financial solidarity between Member States.
However, its added value for the EU was limited and the results could not be measured due to shortcomings in monitoring by the competent authorities and serious shortcomings in the evaluations at the level of the Commission and at the level of the Member States.
Member States' programmes were not integrated into national border control strategies and visas and did not contain SMART objectives or measurable indicators.
The project selection procedures have not ensured that the real needs of the Member States are met.
Unsatisfactory procurement procedures in the Member States pose a risk to the cost-effectiveness of household management.
There are four shortcomings in the management of the Fund in the Member States concerned (Greece, Spain, Italy and Malta, as well as in the first years of financing).
As the EU's main financial instrument to support the protection of external borders, the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013 was provided with EUR 1.9 billion.
Its overarching objective was to support the current and future Schengen countries in ensuring uniform, effective and effective controls at their common external borders.
Our actions 27 Europe in the world The EU's external relations actions aim to: to expand, to ensure stability, security and prosperity in the neighbourhood, to actively promote sustainable development at international level, to promote global political governance and to ensure strategic and civil security.
In the period 2014-2020, the EU allocated EUR 66 billion and 6 percent of the planned expenditure respectively.
The Commission shall manage expenditure, mainly directly through its central services or delegations.
In 2014, the Court drew up the following special reports in this area: • the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) (EEAS) (No 11/2014) in this special report, the Court examined whether the establishment of the EEAS had been properly prepared, whether its resources had been effectively prioritised, organised and allocated, and whether it had effectively cooperated with the Commission and the Member States.
The audit concluded that the EEAS should increase its efficiency and efforts for the EU and its citizens.
The establishment of the EEAS was premature and was not well prepared.
The lack of priorities, organisation and allocation of resources has led to a weakening of its effectiveness.
Coordination between the EEAS and the Commission was only partially effective, mainly due to the lack of effective coordination mechanisms and the rigid financial and administrative framework at the level of the Delegate.
Coordination with Member States may continue to be strengthened to exploit synergies in the exchange of information or shared accommodation and to improve consular services, including the protection of EU citizens.
The EEAS has its headquarters in Brussels and has a network of 140 delegations worldwide.
In 2014, the EEAS had a budget of EUR 519 million, divided between headquarters (41%) and delegations (59%). • EU aid for rehabilitation after the earthquake in Haiti (No 13/2014) In this special report, the Court examined whether EU aid for rehabilitation, EU aid for rehabilitation in Haiti was well designed and implemented, and whether the Commission ensured a proper link between emergency aid and rehabilitation and development.
The audit concluded that EU aid for rehabilitation after the 2010 Haiti earthquake was well designed and targeted at the country's priorities, but that the programmes were not sufficiently implemented and that emergency aid, rehabilitation and development were not sufficiently linked.
Most of the programmes audited have delivered the products according to the timetable or have been delayed in almost all programmes.
Although the Commission was aware of the difficult situation, it was not sufficiently aware of some of the significant risks that threaten the achievement and achievement of the objectives of the programme.
The programmes have been monitored but the Commission and the EEAS have not taken timely action to increase the resources of the EU Delegation to Haiti.
In March 2010, 55 donors granted USD 5.4 billion for the period 2010-2012 for rehabilitation and development and another USD 3.0 billion for 2013 and subsequent years.
The EU was one of the most important donors, one of which was EUR 1.2 billion.
Our actions 28 • The effectiveness of combining financial instruments from regional investment instruments with loans from financial institutions (mixed financing) supporting EU foreign policy (No 16/2014) • In this special report, the Court has dealt with the creation and management of investment instruments and wondered whether the combined financing has benefited from the intended benefits.
As part of the audit, although the mixed financing judgment, i.e. the combination of financial assistance from regional investment instruments with loans from financial institutions to support the EU's external policy, was positive in terms of structure and overall effectiveness, the Court also draws attention to a number of key issues that need to be addressed urgently.
Although these instruments were well developed, the potential benefits of the combined funding were not fully absorbed due to shortcomings in the Commission's management of these instruments.
Almost half of the projects examined did not have sufficient evidence that the grants were justified.
In some cases, investments would probably be made without an EU contribution.
The Commission should ensure that the allocation is based on an accurate and documented distribution of added value in relation to the achievement of the EU's development, neighbourhood and enlargement policy objectives.
Since 2007, the Commission has created eight regional investment instruments.
They combine EFF and EU general budget grants with loans mainly from European financial institutions for development.
• Can the EU's initiative on centres of excellence effectively contribute to reducing chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats from outside the EU?
(No 1) No ) In this special report, the Court assessed whether the initiative was based on a sound analysis of the situation prior to 2010, whether the organisational structure of the initiative was appropriate to address the identified challenges and whether there was an appropriate governance system and whether it was applied.
In the context of the audit, the Court generally welcomed the contribution of centres of excellence to the reduction of the risk associated with CBRN.
This initiative is in line with the priorities set out in the European Security Strategy and the EU Strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
It envisages the involvement of all stakeholders in partner countries in order to improve the sustainability of the actions undertaken.
The organisational structure is generally appropriate, but its complexity has contributed to the delay in starting the business.
The Centres of Excellence initiative aims to create regional platforms in different regions of the world to address the risks of CBRNs.
This is the largest single measure under the long-term component of the Instrument for Stability and a budget of EUR 100 million is made available for the period 2010-2013.
Our actions 29 • Within EuropeAid • Results oriented Monitoring (Rome) systems (No 11/2014) In this special report, the Court examined whether these systems are reliable, whether their structure and resources are adequate and whether they ensure adequate and reasonable arrangements, and whether they are most favourable from the findings.
In the framework of the audit, the Court made a critical assessment of the reliability of these systems.
The bodies responsible for evaluation and performance-based monitoring are well organised, but more attention should be paid to the efficient use of resources.
These systems do not provide sufficient information on the results obtained and do not ensure the greatest possible use of the findings.
The evaluations of projects and programmes organised by Commission delegations and carried out in partner countries are not satisfactorily managed: overall monitoring is inadequate, is unclear on the extent of the resources used and does not have access to the results.
The two main elements of the European Commission's European Commission's European Commission's Commission's Commission's European Development and Cooperation DG (EuropeAid) accounting framework are their performance-based evaluation and monitoring systems.
The total annual cost of the schemes is estimated at EUR 34-38 million.
The annual development expenditure covered by these schemes is estimated at around EUR 8 billion. • EU pre-accession assistance to Serbia (No 19/2014) The Court examined in this special report whether the Commission managed pre-accession assistance to Serbia effectively in the period 2007-2013.
Together with other forms of support, the measures of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) have contributed to Serbia's social and economic reforms and to improving public finance management.
On the basis of the experience gained with other IPA beneficiary countries, the Commission is increasingly focusing on management issues with regard to the planning of financial and non-financial assistance to Serbia.
The Commission has effectively managed non-financial assistance to Serbia in the management and fight against corruption.
With regard to Serbia's preparations for managing EU funds, the Commission has also provided effective support, but only to a limited extent, for IPA management structures.
One quarter of IPA funding for Serbia has been allocated to governance, which, according to the Commission, is the biggest challenge for the country.
The EU complements IPA funding through a number of non-financial measures to help Serbia prepare for EU membership.
Our activities 30 Management Administrative expenditure of EU institutions, agencies and other bodies includes expenditure on staff (personal and pension) and on buildings, equipment, energy, communication and information technologies.
The planned budget for 2014-2020 is for current prices of EUR 70 million, or 6% of the total EU budget.
In 2014, the Court adopted the following special report: • How to calculate, reduce and compensate for greenhouse gas emissions by EU institutions and bodies?
(No 14/2014) In this special report, the Court assessed whether EU institutions and bodies had strategies to reduce the environmental impact of their administrative activities and whether these strategies had been effectively implemented.
In the report, the Court called on the EU institutions and institutions to develop a common policy approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 fingerprints).
The introduction of the environmental management and audit system is slow and the information available on the actual emissions is insufficient.
Few institutions and bodies systematically use environmental contracts.
While EU institutions and bodies have managed to reverse the upward trend in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in their buildings, the available data do not indicate that other sources of emissions, such as business trips, have a clear tendency to reduce emissions.
More than half of the EU institutions and bodies audited have not set any quantitative targets for reducing emissions.
EU environmental policy aims to achieve a high level of protection.
The Treaty (TFEU) requires that environmental requirements be taken into account in the definition and implementation of Union policies and actions in order to promote sustainable development.
Our actions 31 Revenue/own resources are EU revenue to finance expenditure.
There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (customs collected outside the EU and sugar production levies), VAT-based own resources and GNI-based own resources (the largest revenue source in the EU budget).
In 2014, the Court adopted the following special report: • Are preferential trade schemes managed in a proportionate manner?
(No 2/2014) in the report, the Court assessed whether the Commission had properly assessed the economic effects of the preferential trade arrangements and whether the checks effectively ensured that imports could not be subject to the wrong preferential tariff rates as a result of the loss of EU revenue.
The audit showed that although the Commission has improved the quality of the impact assessments over time, it has still not sufficiently analysed the economic impact of the preferential trade systems.
The EU is losing revenue due to shortcomings in customs controls in the Member States: these controls do not prevent the introduction of unfair and preferential import duties in certain cases.
The EU grants preference under unilateral preferential agreements to ensure that developing countries have duty-free access to the EU market, thereby contributing to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development.
In 2011, the value of products imported into the EU under preferential trade arrangements exceeded EUR 242 billion, representing 14% of imports into the EU.
Our actions 32 Financial and economic governance The economic governance framework of the European Union is designed to prevent or detect and correct problematic economic developments, such as excessive deficits or debt, which may hamper economic growth and put the sustainability of public finances at risk.
In 2014, the Court adopted the first special report in this field: • the European Central Bank (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB) (ECB)
The audit showed that the Commission's regulatory reform of the banking sector and the creation of EBA were the first important responses to the financial crisis.
EBA has laid the foundations for a new system of regulation and supervision for the banking sector.
The identified shortcomings concerned cross-border banking supervision, assessment of the resilience of EU banks and the promotion of consumer protection.
In view of the stress tests carried out in 2011, which were carried out at EU level without definitive funding, EBA had a limited legal mandate and limited human resources.
Although the stress test led to the recapitalisation of many banks in 2011, it proved that such stress tests are limited if they are not linked to the assessment of the quality of the total assets.
Questions remain concerning the future role of EBA in banking supervision and the role and responsibilities of EBA and the ECB.
As a result of the financial crisis, the Commission has taken steps to stabilise the banking sector to strengthen the regulatory framework and banking supervision, in particular in the case of banks operating across borders.
EBA was established in 2011 in the framework of the detailed proposals for regulatory changes.
EBA plays a role in the supervision of European banking rules and in the protection of consumers.
Our actions 33 Opinions and other statements adopted in 2014. Opinions on proposals for new or revised legislation with financial implications contribute to improving EU financial management.
These opinions shall be issued at the request of the EU institutions and shall be used by the legislative bodies at the request of the European Parliament and the Council and shall be used by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Court may also, on its own initiative, issue documents and analyses on other matters.
The Court's initiative presented the state of play of the European Court of Auditors on the Commission's report on the fight against corruption, while the study on possible savings in the EU budget was carried out by combining the European Parliament's activities in one place at the request of the European Parliament.

Our actions 34 The Landscape 2014 analysis was a profound novelty for the European Union.
In the context of these changes, the Court has developed and developed a new product: Landscape analysis.
On the basis of the Court's work and of its knowledge and experience, a wide range of issues are covered in each analysis.
The analyses should serve as a basis for consultation and dialogue with the Court's address group and help the Court to submit observations on important issues which appear not to be subject to scrutiny.
The first study of Landscape, published in September 2014, raised issues relating to the responsibility and financial control of the EU (see box), which was the main basis of the EU financial responsibility conference in October 2014 (see page 42).
In November 2014, an analysis of the risks associated with EU financial management was published.
It provides an overview of the EU's financial flows and a summary of the issues to be addressed, inter alia, to ensure a better cost-benefit ratio for EU taxpayers vis-à-vis the EU budget (see box).
Opinions and analyses of Landscape are available in 23 official EU languages on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu).
2 2 Landscape analysis in 2014
Our actions 35 Lukes, overlap and challenges: an analysis of the EU's public responsibility and control system The aim of this analysis is to realise and encourage control of the EU's democratic legitimacy of the institutional system.
It describes the basic features of the accountability framework, the role of public financial control, the key elements of a robust chain of responsibility and financial control, and the six important areas in which accountability and financial control challenges are at EU level, as well as the principles of accountability and financial control in relation to the various new EU and intergovernmental instruments developed in response to the financial crisis.
Optimum use of EU funds: risk analysis for EU financial management At a time when governments and taxpayers of the Member States want the funds they provide to provide greater benefits, the analysis summarises the Court's observations on all aspects of EU financial management.
Based on the Court's 35-year experience in the control of EU revenue and expenditure, the analysis presents an overview of the EU's financial management and a summary of the issues to be addressed in order to ensure a better cost-benefit ratio to the EU budget.
This analysis will be complemented by detailed data on the main characteristics and themes of the various areas of revenue and expenditure and proposals for improvement.
Our actions 36 The analysis identifies a number of key issues that deserve particular attention: ο overly complex eligibility schemes and other EU support conditions that hinder their understanding, management and control and lead to different interpretations; ο public procurement rules and procedures that are not always respected; they are not always respected; they therefore lead to higher costs or delays in financing EU projects; ο insufficient capacity of national authorities to manage and pay EU funds, which increases the risk of errors and the risk of poor quality of expenditure; ο insufficient coordination of the EU budget and national budgets, lack of funds to co-finance Member States and greater emphasis on compliance with the principles that result; ο high levels of commitments from the previous expenditure period that still require financing from the EU budget.

Our actions 37 Relations with addressees The Court's contribution to the EU's accounting obligation depends to a large extent on the benefits its main partners will enjoy in the process of accountability with the results of work and with the results of production.
These partners are the political bodies responsible for public oversight of the use of EU funds (i.e. the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and national parliaments).
In its 2013-2017 strategy, the Court is obliged to make greater efforts to monitor external development and actively shape relations with its partners.
The President and the Members of the Court shall maintain regular contacts with the European Parliament's committees, in particular the Trolls Commission.
In 2014, Mr Caldeira attended two meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and a number of plenary sessions of the European Parliament.
Among them was the presentation of the annual work programme and annual reports.
One of the Court's strategic objectives is to strengthen the partnership with its main addressees, including the various committees specialised in the European Parliament and the Council.
In April 2014, the Court gave Ville Itälä a new role as a member of institutional relations, which contributed to strengthening relations between our institution and the other EU institutions strategically and to increasing the chances of a greater impact through our work.
In 2014, other members of the Court had 64 meetings 64 times before the Commission in relation to the Court's annual reports and annual reports.
This results in discussions in the reports prepared by the individual members of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the Court's special reports, including the draft report on the special reports in connection with the 2013 discharge procedure.
In 2014, the Committee on Budgetary Control started systematically inviting specialised committees to its meetings on the presentation of our reports, thus contributing to the impact of our work.
At the beginning of 2014, the European Parliament adopted a report on the future role of the European Court of Auditors.
The Court welcomed the view expressed in this report that any reform in a broader context should be taken into account in the context of the challenge of improving the EU's reporting obligation.
This applies in particular to the Court's work, its relations with the addressees and the use of resources.
Progress on these issues was highlighted in the peer review report published in 2014 (see major events in 2014)
Our actions 38 In many cases, as part of the implementation of the 2013-2017 strategy, the Court has already launched a series of initiatives to improve, including the improvement of the audit and reporting process and the more flexible organisation of resources.
As a result, more reports have been prepared during the year and the average time needed to develop them has been reduced.
Further efficiency and efficiency of the audit process are expected from the internal reform project launched in 2014.
In its resolution of November 2013, the European Parliament asked the Court to provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential savings for the EU budget if Parliament had one seat, taking into account the savings resulting from less work time and more efficiency.
The Court presented the results of the work in July 2014 and concluded that the transfer from Strasbourg to Brussels could lead to significant savings which were slightly higher as a result of the additional removal from Luxembourg to Brussels.
In 2014, the Court continued its regular cooperation with the Council in various compositions and activities.
The President of Caldeira presented the annual reports to the ECOFIN Council in December 2014 and the Court was regularly invited to submit special reports to the various Council committees and working parties.
Ensuring effective relations with national parliaments is another priority of the Court.
The permanent committees of national parliaments for European affairs and financial control shall be kept regularly informed of the Court's activities.
During the year, delegations from several national parliaments visited the Court, including a delegation from the French Senate in July 2014.
In addition, the Court invited the main addresses of the annual seminar of its members in December 2014 to present to them its position on the challenges of accountability in the EU.
The Court cooperates with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to combat fraud within the EU budget.
By providing OLAF with all information relating to fraud, corruption or other illegal activities, to the detriment of the EU's financial interests, which OLAF establishes in the framework of its control activities or which it receives from third parties.
In 2014, the Court informed OLAF of 16 cases of suspected fraud, corruption or illegal activities in the framework of control activities.
Our activities 39 Cooperation with other major audit bodies The Court cooperates with other supreme audit bodies (ORKBs) mainly in the following bodies: • the ORKB Contact Committee of EU Member States; • the ORKB Network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; • the International bodies for audit of public finances, in particular the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
In September 2014, the Court amended and updated its international cooperation strategy (see box).
EUROSAI Congress, Hague, June 2014
The strategy for international cooperation The Court's cooperation strategy aims to contribute as fully as possible to the EU's public responsibility, in particular by strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation with relevant partners, such as national supreme audit bodies and international audit organisations, in line with the Court's overall strategy for 2013-2017.
Given that the Court's audit responsibilities include areas that have pan-European (e.g. financial management) and global (e.g. climate change), our international cooperation activities are even more important than in the past.
As part of its cooperation strategy, the Court has the following priorities: ο Cooperation at EU level within the Contact Committee and individual cooperation with the EU Member States' CoRs will continue to be the main priorities.
In the context of the enlargement of the EU, the Court will support the Court in activities aimed at enhancing the competence of research in candidate countries and potential candidate countries. The EU Court will act as a member of international audit organisations, such as INTOSAI, in cooperation activities for the establishment of technical standards, as this organisation is important for the development of expertise and the exchange of knowledge in the public finance sector.
As part of the cooperation strategy, in conjunction with other recent activities such as new high-level conferences and meetings, the Court will contribute to raising awareness of the EU's financial management and the EU's financial management obligation.
Our actions 40 Contact Committee of the Supreme Audit Authorities of the EU Member States In accordance with the EU Treaty, the European Constitutional Court and the national audit bodies cooperate fully with each other with respect for their independence.
The Court is actively working with the national Works Councils of the EU Member States within the Contact Committee, including the annual meeting and the various working groups, networks and task forces set up to address specific issues of common interest.
In October 2013, the Court took over the Presidency of the Contact Committee for a period of one year.
As President, the Court held an annual meeting of the Contact Committee held in October 2014.
One of the most important items on the agenda was the seminar on strengthening cooperation, in particular in the areas related to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Banking Union, reporting on the activities of the Contact Committee and its technical partners, and on the audits carried out by the Contact Committee with the EU.
The Court also cooperates bilaterally with EU Member States.
A good example of this is the project carried out jointly by the Court and the ORKB of Poland, the Supreme Chamber of Control, in which the Polish ORKB controllers actively participated in our verification work in Poland in the field of the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases.
In addition, in the context of the Chapter on results, the annual report for the financial year 2014, the Court cooperates with the ORB of Poland and Portugal on the Europe 2020 strategy.
Meeting of the Contact Committee in Luxembourg on 15 and 17 October 2014
Our activities 41 The Network of Supreme Audit Authorities in candidate countries and potential candidate countries Cooperation between the Court and the Court of Auditors in candidate countries and potential candidate countries - in particular within a network comparable to the Contact Committee1.
In 2014, the Court supported the network in carrying out the parallel economic control of energy efficiency, in particular by offering experts in the field of expertise and the methodology of economic control.
In this context, the Court continued to make a significant contribution to the various committees and working groups: • as a member of the Technical Standards Committee and as a member of the Financial Reporting Control Committee, the Sub-Committee for the Evaluation of Legal Standards and the Sub-Committee for the Economic Efficiency Assessment; • as a member of the Technical Competence Development Committee and the Sub-Committee for the Promotion of Good Practices and Quality Assurance through voluntary peer review; • as a member of the Knowledge Exchange Committee and its Environmental Assessment Working Group, as well as of the Working Party for Financial Modernisation and Regulatory Reform in June 2014.
In addition, he participated in the meeting of the EUROSAI Bureau, in which he participated since 2011 and continued to actively participate in the work of the EUROSAI Working Group, in particular in the IT study and the environmental study, in the work of the Monitoring Committee on the establishment and functioning of an electronic database of good practice in the quality of control and in the work of the Monitoring and Ethics Task Force.
The Court also joined the newly created working group on the audit of civil protection assistance.
In the framework of the Joint Conferences of the Regional Working Groups INTOSAI, the Court actively participated in the 2nd Joint Conference ASOSAI2 EUROSAI, which focused on the experience gained with the adoption of the ISSAI3 and on their future implications.
1 In January 2015, the network included six candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey) and a potential candidate country (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
Since November 2013, Kosovo* has been participating in the network as an observer. * This name does not affect positions on Kosovo's status and is in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the declaration of Kosovo's independence.
2 Asian Organisation of the Supreme Organisation of Audit Audit Institutions.
3 International standards for the highest control bodies.
Our activities 42 The main events of the Court's International Court's audit in 2013 asked the ORKB of France, Germany, Sweden and Germany to conduct a specialist assessment (peer review) of the economic assessment.
The peer review was based on the experience of all three partners and was very meaningful both for the Court and for the experts.
This methodology was based on commonly accepted criteria for the work of OPKB and took into account the guidelines contained in international standards.
In 2014, this evaluation was published on the Court's website (eca.europa.eu).
Since the last peer review, the Court has made significant progress in 2008.
The Court examined the challenges arising from the complex institutional framework of the EU and took a number of steps to improve the effectiveness and effectiveness of the controls and the quality of the audit reports.
International control rules encourage international peer reviews.
They enable the highest audit authorities to obtain a voluntary assessment of the performance of their tasks, based on international standards.
In 2014, the Court carried out a peer review of Lithuania's Supreme Audit Authority and was invited to assess the financial control of the jurors and to participate in the peer review of the Spanish ORKB and Lett-lands.
High-level conference on improving accountability in the EU From left to right: Jacques Sciberras, Head of Cabinet, Kevin Cardiff, Member of the Court, Vítor Caldeira and Vice-President Olli Rehn.
In October 2014, the Court organised a high-level conference, to which many persons were invited to ensure that the European Union fulfils its public responsibility to achieve its objectives.
The conference focused on gaps, overruns and challenges at EU and Member State level, which were identified in the Court's analysis on EU legislation on public responsibility and control (see page 35).
The Conference has enabled discussion between participants, including members or representatives of the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court, the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the European Stability Mechanism, national clearing and learning tribunals, in order to discuss how these principles should be developed in response to the development of economic, budgetary and monetary integration.
The EU has focused on accountability, particularly with regard to central banks and supervisors, crisis and post-crisis structures, increasing leverage with regard to EU assistance through participation of third parties and focusing on EU performance.
The participants agreed that there was a need for closer cooperation between government bodies, parliaments and auditors at EU and Member State level, with a view to a better understanding of what EU policies and programmes are provided by society.
Our actions 43 Strengthening the partnership with the national authorities in Lithuania The high-level delegation of the Court visited Lithuania in September 2014 in order to strengthen the partnership with the parliament, the government, the central bank and the central bank in Lithuania and to support the best use and control of EU spending in the country.
The Court and its partners in Lithuania exchanged priorities for increasing the EU's clearing obligation and wondered how best to contribute to the added value of EU spending and to help policy makers and Parliament in Lithuania make the best use of the Court's audit results.
During the visit, the delegation of the Court actively participated in a conference of the Lithuanian Parliament, including the challenges of the calculation and audit in the public sector.
In addition, the delegation and its partners discussed the issues of financial and economic governance and the benefits of Lithuania's accession to the euro area on 1 January 2015.
Lithuania was the first of many EU Member States to be visited by the Court in the coming years in order to strengthen the partnership with the national authorities responsible for the management and control of EU funds.
Our management of the 44th College of the Court of Justice belongs to one member of each Member State.
Under the agreement, the term of office of the members of the Court shall be six years, renewable.
Members shall be assigned to one of the five chambers.
The Boards shall adopt audit reports and opinions and adopt decisions on broader strategic and administrative issues.
In addition, each member shall be responsible for his or her own tasks, which are primarily audit tasks.
The Court's auditors shall carry out the basic audit work and shall be coordinated by the relevant member, assisted by his office.

Our management strategy 46 of the Court for 2013-2017: Progress was made in 2014 in the second year of the Court's implementation of the 2013-2017 strategy.
During this period, the Court's contribution to EU public responsibility should be maximised.
To achieve this objective, the Court has the following priorities: ο focus the Court's products on improving the accountability of the EU; ο work with other stakeholders to increase the Court's contribution to the accountability of the EU; ο develop the Court as a professional audit body; ο make the best use of the knowledge available by the Court as well as the expertise and expertise available to it; ο demonstrate that the Court is able to realise the Court's responsibility.
In 2014, the strategy initiated a major change in the Court's organisational structure.
Two internal working groups dealing with this strategy (including the improvement of the audit process with better definition of tasks and responsibilities) have presented their results.
Together with the European Parliament report on the future role of the European Court of Auditors and on the results of the peer review carried out by the Court.
The various recommendations were summarised in a comprehensive reform project which started at the end of 2014 and which will run until mid-2016.
In the case of special reports, this means that they are to be drawn up in a shorter period of time and, in the case of annual reports, they are intended to increase the concentration and saving of resources.
Secondly, the Court should be transformed into a task-based organisation.
This will enable it to make greater use of resources in order to focus more on controls and analyses that make the most of the added value for EU citizens.
Our management 47 The Court's performance measurement Since 2008 the Court has used central performance indicators (ZLIs) to inform the management of the progress of its objectives, to support the decision-making process and to inform the addressees of the results.
The CLIs reflect the Court's priorities and define its effectiveness and audit responsibilities as a professional audit body.
These indicators are used to measure the basic parameters of the quality and impact of the Court's work, with particular regard to the views of the main addressees and the effectiveness and effectiveness of its use of resources.
The ZLIs were updated for the period covered by the strategy for 2013-2017.
Evaluation by the addressees of the reports The likely impact of the reports The quality and impact of the Court's work shall be assessed by the Court on the quality and impact of its reports on the basis of the assessments carried out by the addressees and the assessments carried out by the experts. Another criterion of the evaluation shall be the actions taken in response to recommendations on the improvement of the EU's financial management.
Moreover, the Court measures its presence in the media.
The Court asked the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament, the Committee on Budgets of the Council, the main bodies controlled by the Commission and the EU Agencies, as well as the EU-ORKB Presidents, to assess the usefulness and impact of its reports published in 2014, on a five-step scale from... very high to... very low.
2 100 % very low 13 56 25 4 53 25 9 0 % 20 % very high 40 % 60 % 80 % low level of response indicates that 94% of the main addresses that point to the value of the ECA reports believe that they are useful for their work (2013: 98 %). 91% believe the Court's work to be effective (2013: 94%).
Our management of 48 reviews carried out by experts Every year independent external experts review the content and present a sample of the Court's reports for quality assessment. In 2014, the auditors assessed eight special reports and the 2013 annual reports.
The assessment of quality - aspects of reporting on a four-stage scale has a significant impact on their quality in (1) in h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

Our management 49 The media presence of the Court's Media Index reflects the Court's media impact.
It concerns the strategic objective of raising the Court's awareness of its products, its findings from the audit and the conclusions of the audit.
In 2014, the Court identified more than 5 100 employees on the Internet in relation to its special reports, the 2013 annual reports and the institutions in general.
40% of these concerned audit reports and the other articles concerned the institution and its work in general.
More than 800 articles have been published on the Special Report on airports within the European Court of Auditors on the implementation of the work programme, the Court plans audits and other tasks on the basis of the annual work programme and monitors the progress achieved during the year.
In 2014, the Court carried out 95% of the tasks provided for in the work programme (90% in 2013).
While the annual reports and the special annual reports were carried out in accordance with the plan, the special reports represented 85% (2013: 70%).

Our management 50 Preparation of special reports In order to influence the Court's special reports, they should be submitted in due course.
In recent years, the Court has reduced the time needed to carry out the audit.
The strategy for 2013-2017 aims to further improve this strategy and its results should be measurable in the coming years.
The Court prepared 24 special reports in 2014, 42% of which (2013: 37%) were completed by the 18-month deadline set by the Court.
On average 19 months (2013): 20 months) for the preparation of special reports adopted in 2014

For 6,4 target ≥ 5 days 5.2 5.8 The inclusion of language courses in 2014, the controller represented an average of 10 days of training.
Support for control activities Human resources Allocation of human resources In view of the difficult situation of public finances in Europe, the Court continued the reduction of human resources by 1% per year over the five-year period (2013-2017), in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2013 on budgetary discipline and financial management.
Therefore, in 2014, from 891 to 882 temporary officials and temporary staff (excluding members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees) staff decreased.
A total of 561 posts are assigned to examination posts (including 113 staff in the members' office).
In 2014, in view of the objective of making the best use of resources, all actions re-identified and transposed the capacity to increase efficiency by simplifying procedures.
The relocation of staff from support staff to control services continued in 2014.
However, this compensated for the transfer of some support services from the members' offices to the administrative pool and the transfer of the Communication and Institutional Relations Department to the President's Departments.
51 Recruitment The Court's staff has a broad academic and professional context and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's findings.
The Court's recruitment policy is consistent with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions, and the EU institutions involve both officials and officials, as well as officials and temporary staff.
The internal selection procedure for grade AST 1 and the selection procedure for the employment of the Ombudsman were carried out in 2014.
In addition, the Court made 77 traineeships available for university graduates for a period of between three and five months per year.
In 2014, the Court had 78 staff: 31 officials, 29 temporary staff, 13 contract staff and five seconded national experts.
The number of job vacancies since 2011 is almost 3% (27 job vacancies on 31 December 2014).

Supporting control activities 52 Gender balance Like other EU institutions, the Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities in the management of human resources and recruitment.
Following a steady increase in women's participation over the years, the Court has achieved, among its staff, a balanced proportion of 50% of men and women.
The following graph shows the percentage of women and men broken down by responsibility on 31 December 2014, which has not changed much in recent years.

Support for control activities 54 The Equal Opportunities Action Plan aims at achieving a balanced participation of women and men at all levels of the Court.
After the last recruitment waves 48% of the staff in grades AD 5 to AD are 8 women (increase compared to 43% in 2009).
Age profile The age profile of workers in active employment on 31 December 2014 indicates that 53% of the Court's staff are 44 years old or younger.

27 (40%) of 67 directors and heads of departments are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, the next five to ten years, when they retire, will be renewed in higher management positions.

Support for control activities 55 Vocational training support services In order to further develop the Court as a professional audit body and to make optimal use of the knowledge available to it and of the expertise and expertise available to it, continuous training of staff is necessary in order to keep up with professional development and to acquire new skills.
In 2014, the Court's staff (researchers and other staff) completed an average of eight days of vocational training.
The participation of language courses in vocational training continues to decrease.
In 2014, they accounted for 43% of the total number of training days (compared with 46% in 2013).
In order to make the best use of existing resources and technologies, the Court offers its staff, from 2014, tailored to the needs, e-learning courses and training in the form of integrated learning, in which participants participate in online training before the event.
In addition, presentations by internal and external experts on audit developments and other relevant areas have been further organised in order to exchange existing internal knowledge and transfer knowledge in order to provide the Court's auditors with the most modern knowledge on the development of public sector audits.
Translation is a work supporting controls, enabling the Court to carry out its mission and to achieve its communication objectives, which are to deliver results in the languages of EU citizens.
In 2014, total translation volume was 4 % higher than in 2013.
More than 98% of translations have been completed according to deadlines.
In addition to normal translation work, the Translation Directorate continued to participate directly in the Court's activities: translators provided linguistic support on 40 audit visits across the EU and in the preparation of audit reports.
In 2014, the Translation Directorate focused mainly on quality assurance.
To this end, the first quality assurance manual for translations was adopted and a system for quality translations for customers was developed.
In order to improve service efficiency, a review and optimisation of the translation process has been carried out and, in cooperation with the Directorate for Information Technology, the translation process has been automated.
Support for control activities 56 All processes related to the development and availability of tools have been carried out with safety and continuity: for example, in 2014 a comprehensive test to restart the new K3 building was carried out after the collapse of the IT systems (disaster recovery) and central IT components (e.g. the launch of the Court's e-mail system) have been upgraded.
The management and infrastructure of the Directorate for Finance and Support Services shall be designed to provide adequate resources, services and infrastructure to enable the Court to fulfil its mission and pursue its strategic objectives, and to ensure that the necessary control, internal control and audit mechanisms are available to support all of the Court's activities.
In 2014, the Directorate continued to focus on making its activities even more efficient and more economical.
An environmental management system is currently being developed for the Court, which is in line with the principles of the Community environmental management and audit system (EMAS), to be approved by the end of 2016.
In 2014, a number of actions were successfully implemented which produced concrete results and showed the Court's commitment to environmental protection, including: • adoption of environmental policy; • carrying out environmental analysis and analysis of compliance with environmental legislation; • increasing the number of environmental awareness campaigns from four in 2013 to eight in 2014; • obtaining a BREEAM environmental certificate (the most important method for designing and evaluating sustainable buildings in the world) for building K3 and maintaining the mark of compliance with best practices in waste management; • promoting sustainable transport for workers by providing a new bicycle space with showers and changing rooms for cyclists, installing an electric car charger and booking parking spaces for bicycle groups.
Support for control activities 57 Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union.
The Court's budget accounts for approximately 0.093 per cent of the total EU expenditure and 1.58% of the total administrative expenditure.
In 2014, the total budget available was 98.8%, compared with 92% in 2013.
The higher execution rate is mainly due to better estimate and planning of expenditure under Title 1 in which the average execution rate was 98.8%.
For Title 2, the average performance rate was 98,4 %.

Support for control activities 59 Auditing and clearing The Court's internal audit The internal auditor shall advise the Court on matters relating to risk control by issuing opinions on the quality of management and control systems and recommendations to improve the conditions for the management of operations and the promotion of sound financial management.
The internal auditor shall also support the work of the external auditor responsible for certifying the Court's annual accounts.
The internal auditor informed the Court of the results of the audits carried out in 2014, the findings, recommendations and the follow-up to these recommendations.
The Court shall report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal auditor's work.

European Court of Auditors, President of EU Financing
The European Court of Auditors 02 Court of Auditors is an independent external audit body of the European Union based in Luxembourg.
It has 28 members from each EU Member State and employs about 900 employees from all EU Member States in the field of audit and administration.
Since its establishment in 1977, the Court has advocated the improvement of EU financial management and the improvement of accounting.
The Court's tasks are to verify that EU funds have been correctly booked, that they have been used and used in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and that they have been used optimally.
It warns against threats, provides security and guidance to policy makers in the EU, how to improve public finance management and ensure that European citizens know how their funds are used.
Through its control activities and other activities, the Court contributes to strengthening the democratic legitimacy and stability of the European Union.

President's preamble 04 Dear Reader, in 2015, to which this activity report relates, the European Union has again faced the serious challenges faced in the management, policy and financial management of the EU, including the creation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the introduction of a single resolution mechanism for banks in the euro area.
These and other events have led to the creation of new audit tasks of the Court.
In 2015, we also examined the activities of EU institutions and other bodies and all EU funds paid to Member States, non-EU countries, international organisations and other beneficiaries.
In accordance with our obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we have prepared annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund and special annual reports on the annual accounts of more than 50 EU agencies and other bodies.
In addition, we have prepared 25 special reports on a number of topics, the results of which are summarised in this activity report.
We would like to draw your attention to two specific reports: the report on the Emissions Trading Scheme, which shows that our work goes beyond purely financial issues, as well as the report on financial assistance to countries in difficulty, which forms part of a series of new special reports on financial and economic governance.
In addition, last year we issued eight opinions on new or revised EU legislation with a significant financial impact, including an opinion on the EFSI Regulation.
In order for our work to be effective, we need to provide the information we have received to stakeholders both at EU level and at national level.
During the year, we have deepened our cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union During the year, we have deepened our cooperation with our key partners in ensuring the European Union's reporting obligations.
The results of our studies have been presented by an increasing number of specialised committees of these institutions, and their concerns have been taken into account during the planning of future studies.
Members of the Court also made high-level visits to the Member States to strengthen their partnership with national authorities, parliaments and audit bodies.
In 2015, we organised two important conferences: one in Brussels on EU energy security and the other in Luxembourg on the future of assistance in the context of the new UN Sustainable Development Goals.
We have also prepared a comprehensive internal reform to better respond to ongoing changes in the European Union.
This report presents some important changes that we have made with regard to our relations with stakeholders, our audits and our resources.
In addition, you receive important information on the management of human resources, finance and services and the results of our internal and external audits last year, as well as on the latest annual discharge procedure.
I hope that this report will provide you with a useful and interesting overview of the Court's activities in 2015, in which we intend to achieve our task of improving the financial management of the EU, increasing accountability and transparency and protecting the financial interests of EU citizens.
2015 summary 05 Our management • Annual reports on the general budget of the EU • and the European Development Fund for the financial year 2014, containing the statement of assurance and the results of the audit. • 52 annual reports containing the Court's opinions on the audit reports of the various EU agencies and agencies and two summary reports. • Internal reform has been carried out to improve our control and reporting procedures and to ensure greater flexibility in the management of our resources. • 25 specific reports on specific management topics and budgetary areas, including the emissions trading system, youth employment programmes and assistance during the financial crisis. • Eight opinions on new or revised EU legal acts and other decisions affecting the financial management, from the proposed regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments to the revised regulation on the Single Resolution Mechanism. • Meetings, seminars and conferences with our addressees, including two high-level conferences on EU commitments on energy and development assistance.
In terms of recruitment and management of human resources, we continued our policy of equal opportunities. • In terms of integration of IT systems, audit management and audit documentation, we made significant progress, and we made available information related to audit on mobile devices, as well as the buildings of the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg.
Our activities 06 Audits Our audit reports and opinions are an important link in the EU's liability chain because they are used to hold the EU's financial management entities accountable in particular under the annual discharge procedure.
They are primarily the European Commission, but also other EU institutions and bodies.
In shared management areas, Member States also play an important role, for example, in agricultural and cohesion spending.
Our three main products are: • Annual reports containing mainly the results of accounting checks and compliance checks in relation to the budget of the European Union and the European Development Fund (EDF), taking into account aspects of financial management and results.
These reports are accompanied by specific annual reports published separately for EU agencies, decentralised bodies and joint undertakings. • Special reports presenting the results of selected performance and compliance audits for specific expenditure or policies or budgetary or management issues. • Opinions on new or amended legal acts which affect financial management as well as other products based on analyses carried out at the request of another institution or on the Court's own initiative.
We are trying to manage our resources in a way that ensures a proper balance between our different actions, while at the same time taking full account of the different areas of the EU budget, and achieving robust results.
In 2015, we used a large part of our resources to produce annual statements of assurance, which were then presented in our annual reports.
The work underlying the Statement of Assurance covers two aspects for which, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we must issue an annual audit opinion: the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
Furthermore, we take into account, as far as possible, the performance of other auditors (see the section on the review of the EU Agencies on page 14) and management declarations in the form of annual reports on the activities of the Directors-General of the Commission.
In addition to statutory controls, we choose, at our discretion, specific expenditure or policy areas, on the basis of criteria such as the risk of irregularities or insufficient results, the potential for improvement and the public interest.
We choose these issues in a completely independent way, but we take into account the views of our address circle.
In 2015, we prepared 25 special reports, which are in particular the result of our performance controls.
A summary of the special reports is presented in this activity report (pages 15-33).
In 2015, we issued eight opinions on proposals for new or revised provisions and regulations (p. 34).
In particular, we pay attention to our opinion on EFSI to highlight both the subject and the impact of our opinions.
All audit reports and opinions are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).

Our activities 08 Audit visits in 2015. While most of the audit work at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg took place in Luxembourg, the auditors also carried out audit visits to the authorities of the Member States, to other beneficiaries of EU funds in and outside the European Union (including the organisations involved in the allocation of EU funds, such as the European Investment Bank's regional offices in Kenya and Uganda) and to other EU institutions, agencies and bodies.
As a result of these visits, we received direct proof of control from the authorities responsible for the approval, management, collection and payment of EU funds, as well as from the relevant final beneficiaries.
Our teams of controllers usually consist of two to three controllers, and the duration of the verification visit may be several days, but also several weeks.
The frequency and intensity of control activities in individual Member States and beneficiary countries depends on the type of control and, where appropriate, on the selection of the sample.
The number of inspection visits may therefore vary from country to year.
In the EU, our audit visits are often carried out in conjunction with the highest audit authorities in the Member States visited.
In 2015, the Court's auditors spent 4 310 days on-the-spot checks in the Member States and outside the EU and obtained evidence of checks in respect of annual reports and selected audit tasks (special reports).
In addition, they devoted a lot of time to the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as to decentralised agencies and bodies across the EU.
On-the-spot checks took less days than in 2014.
This is due to more effective working procedures and the increasing use of technologies such as secure data and documents exchange and video conferencing.
Detecting fraud Although our controls are not specifically designed to detect fraud, sometimes during our audit work, we encounter cases where we suspect irregularities or fraudulent actions.
The Court cooperates with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to combat fraud from the EU budget.
Any suspicion of fraud, corruption or other illegal activities that may affect the EU's financial interests that arise during our audit work, we shall forward it to OLAF.
These cases shall then be monitored by OLAF, which shall decide on a possible investigation and, where appropriate, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
In 2015, we handed over 27 cases of suspected fraud to OLAF (2014: 16).

Our activities 10 Annual Reports for the financial year 2014 Most of our accounting audits and compliance audits have been dedicated in 2015 to the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2014.
The 2014 Annual Report was published on 10 November 2015 and presented to our addressee, including the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the European Union (Ecofin and Financial Councils), the national parliaments and governments, as well as the media.
Our main objective of the annual report is to help the European Parliament, the Council and citizens assess the quality of EU financial management by submitting proposals and proposals.
In our 2014 Annual Report, we have ensured that EU funds will be used during the financial year under consideration, highlighting the areas where the risk that EU funds have not been fully used is the greatest.
In addition, we analyse the reasons for errors and make useful and cost-effective recommendations for possible improvements.
We have revised the structure of our annual report for the financial year 2014 to make this report clearer.
The titles of the chapters correspond to the headings of the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020.
The key element of the report is still the statement of assurance in which we deliver an opinion on the reliability of the EU accounts and on compliance with the rules on revenue and expenditure.
In addition, we have made a specific assessment of all the main areas of EU activity and have provided extensive information on budgetary and financial management.
The report also provides information on the results of the EU budget and the Commission's reporting, in particular on progress towards the Europe 2020 objectives.
President Vítor Caldeira presented the European Parliament with the annual report of the European Court of Auditors for 2014 of EUR 142.5 billion in 2014 = almost EUR 300 per citizen.
Our actions 11 The main conclusions of the 2014 Annual Report are that the European Court of Auditors calls for a new approach to EU investment and expenditure. The credibility of the EU accounts was confirmed in 2014.
Conclusions and recommendations and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and,,,, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
We could therefore once again give an unlimited opinion on their credibility.
However, we have issued a wrong opinion on the regularity of payments. the estimated error rate for the 2014 payments for the error rate is 4.4%. This is close to the error rate for 2013 (4.5%) and is constantly above the materiality threshold of 2 %. for the expenditure to be managed shared with the Member States, and for the expenditure managed directly by the Commission, the estimated error rate was however equal to (4.6%).
The highest error rates have been set for economic, social and territorial cohesion expenditure (5.7%) and for co-financing for growth and employment (5.6%).
For administrative expenditure, the lowest estimated error rate (0,5%) was established. For administrative expenditure, there is a clear link between expenditure types and error rates.
The estimated error rate for reimbursement schemes (5.5%) for which the EU reimburses eligible costs for eligible actions based on the cost statements drawn up by the beneficiaries is twice as high as the estimated error rate for payment entitlements schemes (2.7%) for which no costs are reimbursed but payments are subject to certain conditions. for corrective actions taken by the authorities in the Member States and the Commission, there has been a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
Without these measures, the estimated total error rate would be 5,5 %.
The Commission needs further improvements in the assessment of risks and the impact of corrective actions in so far as the Commission, the Member States' authorities and independent auditors use all the information available to them could prevent, detect and correct a significant proportion of errors prior to their appearance. The amounts to be paid over and over the coming years are still very high.
The Commission must take steps to address this persistent problem.
In partnership agreements and programmes, Member States do not sufficiently take into account the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
In view of these two aspects, the Commission can only partially monitor the results and the contribution of the EU budget to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. In view of the upcoming mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, it is crucial for the management of EU expenditure.
It is important that the Commission examines as soon as possible the areas where the high level of error is maintained, assess the potential for reducing these error rates, focusing more on expenditure results.
Our actions 12 Control of transactions in specific areas of EU spending - Results in 2014. Expenditure in the area of Natural Resources Economic, social and territorial cohesion Competitiveness for growth and jobs in Europe in the world Managing verified populations and estimated error rate 5.6% 2.7% 0.5 % 3.6 % 5.7% Conclusions from the control of EUR 57.5 billion EUR 13.0 billion EUR 7.4 billion EUR 8,8 billion EUR 0 20 40 60 billion EUR Table is presented on the EU website in 2014 (ec.europa.eu/en/e/audit increase-2014).
Our actions 13 Annual Report on the European Development Fund (EDF) 2014. Revenues were not affected by any errors. were not affected by significant errors. Within the framework of the EDF, the European Union is spending on development cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and with overseas countries and territories (OCTs).
The EDFs are financed by the Member States and managed by the European Investment Bank outside the EU budget by the European Commission and are financed by the European Investment Bank.
Their income was not significantly affected by errors, while the estimated error rate in payments was 3.8%.
As in previous years, shortcomings in ex ante controls have been identified.
The estimated error rate is approximately two thirds due to errors related to non-compliance with public procurement rules and lack of evidence to justify expenditure.
Our annual report on the EDF will be published together with our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget and is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Our activities 14 Special Annual Reports 2014 Total in 2014 around €4 billion has been allocated to all EU agencies, bodies and joint enterprises.
EU agencies, other bodies and joint undertakings perform specific tasks on behalf of the EU and are established in different EU Member States.
They operate in many areas such as safety, health, research, finance, migration and transport, and in any case have their own mandate, management, director, staff and budget.
In 2015 we prepared 52 special annual reports for the financial year 2014.
They concerned 41 decentralised agencies, executive agencies and other EU bodies, eight European Joint Research Undertakings, European Schools, the Galileo Joint Undertaking in the decommissioning and communication infrastructure of Sisnet.
In addition, we have published two summaries of the results of our audits in this area (one summary of EU agencies and other agencies, and the other summary of joint enterprises).
These reports have been submitted to the President of the European Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, the Council for General Affairs and the Committee on Budgets of the Council.
In 2014, each financial statement of 33 decentralised EU agencies and other bodies was first verified independently of a private audit firm.
In drawing up our opinions on these financial statements, we have taken into account this audit work and the actions taken by the evaluation bodies on the basis of the audit findings.
The financial statements of other agencies and joint ventures have been fully audited by us.
In 2014, we considered the accounts of all agencies, other bodies and joint enterprises to be reliable.
The processes were legal and correct, except for Artemis (built-in systems), ENIAC (nanoelectronics) and ECSEL (electronic components and systems).
Overall, the agencies have improved their procedures by taking corrective action on the basis of our comments from previous years.
Our special annual reports and two summaries of the audit results of the agencies, other bodies and joint enterprises for 2014 are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
52 specific annual reports on EU agencies, other bodies and joint enterprises based across Europe, based in Europol, The Hague, the Netherlands.
Our activities 15 Special Reports developed in 2015. In addition to our annual reports and special annual reports, we publish special reports throughout the year containing the results of the performance and compliance checks that we carry out in the specific budgetary areas or management areas that we choose.
When selecting and designing these control tasks, we try to achieve the maximum effect and thus make the best use of our resources.
Our economic controls often cover several financial years, and their subject matter is complex, so their completion may last longer than a year.
In 2015, the special reports focused in particular on the following issues: the EU's overall objective of creating added value and growth, and the EU's response to global challenges such as the sustainability of public finances, the environment and climate change.
The relevant headings corresponding to the headings of the multiannual financial framework are summarised in a summary of the 25 special reports prepared in 2015.

Our actions 16 100 80 60 40 20 0 Competitiveness for growth and jobs EUR 143 billion 13 % Smart and inclusive growth Within the Smart and Inclusive Growth Unit, the EU budget is the majority of the expenditure.
This area covers two sub-headings of competitiveness for growth and jobs for economic, social and territorial cohesion for growth and jobs for economic and social cohesion for territorial cohesion for growth and jobs for growth and growth.
The Competitiveness sub-heading for growth and jobs 2014-2020 covers the financing of trans-European energy, transport and telecommunications networks, business development, research and innovation, education and training, social policy, etc. The planned expenditure for 2014-2020 represents 13% of the total EU budget for the programming period, i.e. EUR 143 billion.
For 2015, EUR 15.7 billion were allocated. • Inland navigation in Europe: no significant improvement in the share of transport and navigation conditions since 2001 (No. 1/2015) the special report examines whether the projects co-financed by the EU budget have effectively contributed to increasing the share of maritime transport in inland waterway transport and improving the capacity of inland waterway transport and whether EU inland waterway strategies have been consistent and based on appropriate and comprehensive analyses.
Projects co-financed by the EU have not been successfully implemented as an alternative to road transport, as they have not been successfully implemented as an alternative to inland waterway transport, nor have they been able to improve the transport capacity.
Although the Commission has identified inland navigation as a priority, Member States have given little attention to inland navigation.
There is no coherent overall strategy for Member States combined with the main shipping corridors, and the EU strategies do not take sufficient account of the maintenance of the river, as well as of political and environmental considerations.
Member States should prioritise inland waterway transport projects which bring the greatest and most direct benefits and the Commission should focus its resources on projects where advanced bottlenecks are available.
Between 2007 and 2013, the TEN-T programme, the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund allocated €1.3 billion to inland waterway projects in the EU.
Our actions 17 • Are the needs of micro-enterprises adequately met by EU financial support?
(No 8/2015) This Special Report examines whether the needs of micro-entities are met by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Progress Microfinance Facility (ESF).
The auditors found that programming and planning of financial support granted by the ESF was weak and that the implementation of the results was not adequately and reliably monitored.
Neither the Commission nor the Member States had comparative information on Member States' administrative costs and funding mechanisms.
These circumstances may have a negative impact on the effectiveness of EU financial support to micro-enterprises.
Member States should assess needs when developing financial instruments and when developing operational programmes, including financial support for micro-entities by the EU.
The Commission should make the use of ESF financial instruments by Member States conditional on the existence of sound risk management systems.
In the case of microfinance, loans of less than EUR 25 000 are usually granted and often less than EUR 10 000.
The total demand for funding in EU Member States is estimated to be over EUR 12 billion.
Examples of this report are: providing €5,000 for urban kiosk development and €9500 for the development of the playground and clothing store. • Improving security of energy supply through the development of the internal energy market: in the Special Report on energy security (No 16/2015) on energy security (No 16/2015) on whether the implementation of internal energy market policy and energy infrastructure expenditure in the EU have effectively contributed to the security of energy supply benefits.
The audit showed that energy infrastructure in Europe in general is not yet fully integrated and therefore currently does not provide effective security of energy supply.
Therefore, the Commission should define the energy infrastructure in the EU, which is not actively used, and cooperate with the Member States in order to overcome obstacles to its use for the purposes of the internal energy market.
The Commission should also consider new ways of making energy available to customers from another Member State from one Member State.
The internal energy market aims to enable the free movement and trade of natural gas and electricity across the EU.
Within the EU budget, €3.7 billion has been earmarked for the financing of energy infrastructure for the period 2007-2013, with a further € 7.4 billion for the period 2014-2020.
However, the report stresses that the EU's objective of completing the internal energy market by 2014 has not been achieved.
Our actions 18 Economic, social and territorial cohesion Intelligent and inclusive growth Sub-heading "Economic, social and territorial cohesion its objective is to support the EU's least-developed countries and regions to join the rest of the regions to strengthen competitiveness and cooperation between them.
Cohesion expenditure 2014-2020 accounts for 34% of the EU budget for the entire programming period, i.e. EUR 367 billion.
100 80 60 40 20 0 367 billion EUR 34% • Efforts should be stepped up to address the public procurement problems of EU cohesion expenditure (No 10/2015) in a special report on the assessment of whether the Commission and the Member States are taking appropriate and effective action to address the problems of public procurement errors in cohesion policy.
The audit showed that there are still widespread public procurement problems across the EU.
Although the Commission and the Member States have started to address this issue, much remains to be done.
Serious errors have led to a lack of fair competition and a lack of award to the best tenderers.
The systematic analysis is very limited and lacks sufficiently accurate, reliable and consistent data on the nature and scale of errors.
If the situation does not improve by the end of 2016, it is recommended to suspend payments to the Member States concerned for the period 2014-2020.
For the period 2007-2013, € 349 billion was allocated to regional policy expenditure to be paid under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund.
A large proportion of these funds are spent through public procurement.
In the case of approximately 40% of the projects which the Court examined for its annual accounts for the financial years 2009 to 2013 for public procurement, errors were found.
Our actions 19 • EU funding of urban waste water treatment plants in the Danube basin: Member States need further support in the implementation of EU waste water treatment policy objectives (No 2/2015) in this special report assess the effectiveness of support to Member States in the Danube basin from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in the implementation of EU waste water treatment policy objectives.
The audit showed that although EU spending programmes have contributed significantly to the progress made in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, there have been delays in compliance and the use of available EU funds in all countries.
Although sewage in installations in these countries were usually properly absorbed, the treatment of sewage sludge and rainwater leaks in some cases was insufficient.
One third of the installations were overdeveloped and potentially unsustainable in the long run.
These countries have slowly benefited from the available EU funds, which have threatened the loss of EU funds or the loss of additional funds from national budgets.
The Commission should strengthen reporting requirements and Member States should lay down rules to ensure fast connection to public sewerage.
The Commission and the Member States should establish criteria for all types of use of sewage sludge and ensure reliable monitoring of pollution.
The Danube basin area is the largest area in Europe.
The EU contribution to waste water treatment projects in the four Member States audited • for the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 programming periods amounted to EUR 7.9 billion. The water quality in the Danube basin: progress in implementing the Water Framework Directive, but the need for further action (No 23/2015) is further examined in the special report as to whether the implementation of the Water Framework Directive by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia has led to improved surface water quality in the Danube basin.
The audit showed that only a few improvements have been made since 2004.
The main reason for the limited progress was that the Member States' plans were not ambitious enough.
Targeted actions were missing for water bodies of insufficient quality.
In addition, shortcomings in the monitoring systems have led to the lack of data on both the type of pollution and the sources of pollution that led to the negative assessment of the state of aquatic organisms.
In addition, Member States have abandoned a significant number of water bodies without sufficient justification for significant deadlines.
Between 2007 and 2013, Member States in the Danube basin received €6.35 billion from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund for waste water treatment.
During the same period, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development received EUR 6.39 billion to cover the expenditure to farmers related to agri-environmental measures.
Our actions 20 • EU Youth Guarantee: The start is possible, but the risk of implementation is predictable (No 3/2015) is analysed in the special report, whether the Commission has adequately supported the Member States in creating the Youth Guarantee and whether the risk of implementation is possible.
The audit identified three risks that could hinder the effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee: the adequacy of the overall budget, the definition of high quality jobs, and the way the Commission monitors the Youth Guarantee and presents results.
The auditors concluded that the Commission had helped the Member States to implement the Youth Guarantee in a timely and appropriate manner.
However, the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment indicating the expected costs and benefits, although this is a standard procedure.
Although the Commission asked the Member States to provide estimates of the costs when submitting plans for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, some of them did not provide the necessary information, none of the Member States indicated the estimated costs of the necessary structural reforms.
The Youth Guarantee was established in June 2013 in response to the deterioration of the situation of unemployed young people, which aggravated the economic and financial crisis.
In the period 2014-2020, the Youth Guarantee The European Social Fund and the special initiative for youth employment The EU budget co-financed a total of EUR 12.7 billion. • Support for youth teams by the Commission: The transfer of resources from the ESF successfully but not sufficiently focused on results (No 17/2015) This special report examines whether the Youth Action Teams presented proposals in 2012 on how to achieve results more quickly and more effectively by young unemployed people, and whether these proposals contributed to the transfer of resources from the ESF.
The auditors concluded that, although the Youth Action Teams set up by the Commission have managed to regroup funds for projects to support young people, these proposals have only been presented to a limited extent.
The Commission provided Member States with advisory assistance but was limited in the scope and quality of the information available.
While the initiative has led to the reprogramming and reprogramming of the European Social Fund, the Commission has focused mainly on its budgetary impact in its assessment of the changes in the operational programmes.
Where there are discrepancies between the promises and the real objectives achieved by the Commission, there should not be too high expectations for such initiatives.
As part of the Youth Opportunities initiative, the Commission set up youth teams in 2012.
The teams included experts from eight Member States with the highest number of unemployed among young people and experts from the Commission.
This initiative covered almost EUR 10 billion of the European Social Fund, which were still available in the Member States concerned.
Our actions 21 Natural resources €417 billion Sustainable growth: Natural resources This heading includes a common agricultural and fisheries policy, rural development and EU environmental action.
Three quarters of the expenditure concerns direct payments to farmers and support to agricultural markets.
The expenditure planned for 2014-2020 represents almost 39% of the total EU budget for this programming period, i.e. EUR 417 billion.
The 2015 budget was EUR 56 billion.
100 80 60 40 20 0 39 % • Technical assistance: What contribution has it made to agriculture and rural development?
(No 4/2015) This special report examines the use of financial resources for technical assistance in agriculture and rural development for the 2007-2013 programming period.
The audit focused on the regularity, effectiveness and effectiveness of funding at the level of the Commission and the Member States.
The audit showed that neither the European Commission nor the Member States were able to demonstrate how the use of technical assistance in the field of agriculture and rural development contributed to the use of budgetary resources and to the achievement of the objectives of the common agricultural policy.
Rural networks to support cooperation, knowledge exchange and innovation in the agricultural sector are very good beneficiaries of technical assistance.
However, in most cases, capacity-building funds were used to support general administrative budgets.
The Commission should clarify the scope and use of technical assistance in the Member States in the field of rural development and closely monitor its implementation.
For the period 2007-2013, Member States have planned to allocate €1.5 billion to technical assistance under the EU budget under the ceiling of 4 % of the national financial framework available for rural development.
In the period 2014-2020, this amount increased to around €1.9 billion.
Our actions 22 • Are financial instruments in the field of rural development an effective and promising instrument?
(No 5/2015) This special report concerns whether the financial instruments (credits and guarantee funds) introduced under rural development policy have been well developed and managed during the 2007-2013 programming period.
The audit showed that the financial instruments were not yet effective.
This is mainly due to overcapitalisation of financial instruments and their lack of potential with regard to the desired leverage effect and the renewable effect.
There was no clear argument for the introduction of financial instruments for the 2007-2013 programming period.
In addition, reliable quantitative information was not available to justify the nature of the financial instruments established, to identify the demand for financial instruments in the agricultural sector and to demonstrate that the amount allocated to the fund was appropriate.
Incentives for Member States to create financial instruments for rural development and to increase the demand for farmers or other beneficiaries should be stepped up and appropriate standards and targets for leverage and renewables for 2014-2020 should be set.
By the end of 2013, the EU and its Member States invested around €700 million in guarantee and credit funds for rural development.
The Commission wants Member States to commit to at least doubling the use of these instruments for the period 2014-2020.
Approximation of economic control: the integrity and implementation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (No 6/2015) The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) differs in a way from other policies and programmes that we are investigating because it does not receive significant funding from the EU budget.
However, it has a huge impact on the implementation of EU policies and on the quality of life of citizens.
The EU ETS was introduced in 2005 and is often referred to as the reference model for the development of emission trading strategies and schemes elsewhere in the world.
Therefore, an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework for the market, legal certainty and management systems for relevant information are expected.
The basic structures of the implementation systems should also be sufficiently robust.
At the end of 2013, our auditors examined the framework for the protection of the integrity of the EU ETS and the systems for the effective implementation of the programme by the Commission and the Member States by Phase II (end 2012).
The evaluation was carried out because of the risks associated with the creation of a functioning market with a view to implementing EU climate policy and because of the difficulties of controlling untraceable activities (how is hot air measured? how).
Our auditors have examined whether the EU ETS was properly managed.
To this end, they not only checked the file and interviewed the officials involved in the management of the EU ETS in the European Commission in Brussels, but also visited the competent authorities in five Member States (Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom).
In addition, in two other countries (Greece and Spain), the documents were reviewed and the experts were consulted.
More evidence was obtained from auditors who checked the 150 installations selected in these seven Member States as well as data from the EU transaction protocol.
Our actions 23 are being analysed and the inspectors could not control the equipment on the ground because they are not financed by EU funds under the Emissions Trading Scheme and the Court therefore does not have the access rights required for the control.
The evidence obtained by our auditors indicated that the emissions market was not being monitored and that there was insufficient cooperation between regulators.
For example, our auditors concluded that the legal definition of allowances should be clarified and that the procedures for the opening of ETS accounts in the Union Registry and the monitoring of transactions were not adequate in order to ensure adequate checks on fraud.
However, the initial situation was difficult: Member States could not effectively monitor cross-border transactions because they had no direct access to the central database and the Commission was not able to monitor the transactions because there was no legal basis for this.
Our auditors also found that the emission monitoring and reporting systems were not harmonised and that the controls were weak and insufficient support from the Commission and from the Commission and the Member States.
In their findings, the auditors concluded that the framework for protecting the integrity of the market is not sufficiently robust and that, at the last stage, there have been significant shortcomings in the implementation, which in some cases require further action at this stage.
However, our report also shows that this innovative system has been continuously improved.
At the time of publication of the report, the debate on possible reforms of the EU ETS, which focused on the effectiveness of the system and the management of the surplus of powers, was not yet completed.
However, in our report, we note that attention should also be paid to the fundamental issues of market integrity and implementation, so that the EU can be sure that this fundamental instrument is sufficient to meet the expectations of reducing emissions and low-carbon technologies.
We have made some practical recommendations to the Commission and the Member States' authorities to improve market integrity and to implement the system so that the EU ETS becomes a more effective tool to achieve the climate targets by 2020 and beyond.
The Commission agreed with the recommendation in the report that, in order to improve market integrity, significant remaining problems in the regulation and supervision of the market should be addressed where appropriate, and that a number of improvements have already been made in phase III (2013-2020) in order to improve market integrity, in particular with regard to our comments.
This report aroused great media interest and was presented to accredited EU journalists at a press conference in Brussels.
In the EU and around the world, the press reported that the EU ETS should be more supervised to improve the carbon market and that the system should be more protected from market abuse, including the still high risk of VAT fraud.
As usual for all special reports, the Member responsible for the report, in this case Kevin Cardiff, reports to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, as well as to the Committee on the European Parliament and the Environment Council, in order to forward to them the conclusions of the Court, which may form the basis for future decisions on the relevant provisions and regulations.
Parliament and the Council welcomed our comments and recommendations and will take into account future proposals to improve the integrity and implementation of the system.

Our actions 24 • Are fisheries partnership agreements well managed by the Commission?
(No 11/2015) ) This Special Report examines whether contracts are well managed.
The auditors assessed the negotiations and implementation of the agreements, the monitoring of catches by the Commission and the selection and control of the actions financed.
The audit showed that although contracts were generally well managed, the quantities negotiated were often higher than the quantities declared during the previous periods.
This leads regularly to incomplete use of resources.
As the EU makes full payments regardless of the actual catches made, the actual costs were often higher than the negotiated price.
Furthermore, reliable, uniform and complete data on actual catches of the EU fleet were missing.
In negotiating the new rules, the Commission should take into account earlier utilisation rates, which make payments more dependent on actual catches and ensure that the new fishing database is fully used by the flag Member States and contains reliable catch data that can be monitored and updated.
The aim of the agreements is to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries concerned by allowing EU vessels to fish exclusively for surplus resources of the partner countries.
However, auditors doubt whether the so-called surplus can be reliably calculated due to the lack of reliable information. • The EU priority to support the knowledge-based economy in rural areas has been breached as a result of insufficient management of knowledge transfer and advice (No 12/2015) on the basis of this Special Report, in particular to examine whether management and control systems exist to effectively implement knowledge transfer and advice in the field of rural development.
The audit has shown that the implementation of EU funded VET and VET programmes in rural areas is too expensive, often leads to duplication of existing programmes and is beneficial for existing providers of training services.
Auditors have identified shortcomings in administrative procedures in the Member States and insufficient supervision by the European Commission.
Member States relied too much on instructors' proposals and considered all kinds of training to be good and eligible for public support.
The lack of fair and transparent choice has led to the fact that the selection of existing and existing suppliers has been repeatable for a long time and most of them have received support.
Member States should select training projects that meet the skills needs of the periodic analysis and avoid the establishment of selection procedures by suppliers.
The EU supports rural training and advisory projects from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
€1.3 billion has been allocated to these projects for the period 2007-2013.
Together with Member States' co-financing, the total amount of public support amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
This amount may amount to over EUR 4 billion over the period 2014-2020.
Our actions 25 • The cost-effectiveness of EU rural development assistance for non-productive investments in agriculture (No 20/2015) in particular determines whether non-productive investments in agriculture (NPI) are cost-effective and contribute to the achievement of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the sustainable management of agricultural land in the 2007-2013 programming period.
The auditors concluded that although aid to the NPI contributed to the achievement of the objectives, it was not profitable, as the costs of 75% of the projects audited were disproportionate.
Many of these projects were fully funded by public funds, although they obviously benefited, and the auditors visited four Member States, which in total spent 80% of the total EU budget on NIP: Portugal, Denmark, the United Kingdom (England) and Italy (Apulia).
Only five of the 28 projects audited proved cost-effective.
The report warns that the lack of cost efficiency may not be limited to the sample as the problems identified are due to shortcomings in the management and control systems of the Member States.
Non-productive investments are investments that do not lead to significant revenue or revenue or to a significant increase in the value of the beneficiary's activities but have a positive impact on the environment. • Infrastructure support in EU rural areas: these measures could be used in a much more efficient way (No 25/2015) in this special report, which examines whether the European Commission and the Member States have achieved a good cost-benefit ratio through the financing of roads, water supply systems, schools and other institutions in the framework of rural development programmes.
The audit showed that although some infrastructure projects have made a positive contribution in rural areas, Member States and the Commission have achieved insufficient cost-benefit ratio in shared management.
Member States have not always made it clear that the EU needs to finance rural development.
The risk of supporting projects without EU funding has not been effectively controlled.
The report concludes that the Commission has adopted a more active and coordinated approach since 2012.
Appropriate implementation should lead to improved financial management for the period 2014-2020.
Between 2007 and 2013, the rural development programmes allocated EUR 13 billion to rural infrastructure.
Our actions 26 100 80 60 40 20 0 Foreign policy EUR 65 billion 6% Europe in the world Europe in the world covers the external relations of the EU (the world's foreign policy), including enlargement issues, as well as EU development and humanitarian aid.
During the 2014-2020 programming period, the EU has allocated 6% of the planned total expenditure, i.e. EUR 65 billion.
In 2015, the budget amounted to EUR 7.5 billion.
Additional appropriations will be made available through the European Development Fund, which is not part of the EU budget and is therefore not covered by the multiannual financial framework. • EU police mission in Afghanistan: Mixed results (No 7/2015) in the Special Report assess whether the EU police mission (EUPOL) was well planned and coordinated, whether it received appropriate operational support and appropriate guidance, whether it contributed to progress in the field of the national Afghan police and whether it was prepared in the appropriate form.
The audit has shown that EUPOL has partially fulfilled the objective of contributing to the establishment of a permanent and effective civilian police force under Afghan responsibility.
In an environment characterised by the lack of trained, fully functioning Afghan police forces, high illiteracy and widespread corruption in Afghan police and judicial systems, EUPOL has managed to contribute to the reform of the Ministry of the Interior and the professionalisation of the national police.
However, given the persistent shortcomings in the police and judicial system in Afghanistan, there is a risk that the results of EUPOL and, in general, the Afghan police will not survive by the end of 2016.
The total cost of EUPOL between May 2007 and December 2014 amounted to almost EUR 400 million, with almost one third of the security costs.
At the end of 2014, the EU sent a total of 32 missions under the Common Security and Defence Policy, 16 of which were completed and completed and 16 were still ongoing.
Our actions 27 • EU support for the fight against torture and the abolition of the death penalty (No 9/2015) for the fight against torture and for the abolition of the death penalty (No 9/2015) for the fight against torture and rehabilitation of torture victims and for the abolition of the death penalty under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
The audit showed that although EU-funded projects are producing results, projects are often not sufficiently targeted and have limited scope, as funds are distributed in accordance with the casting principle.
The allocation of funds was usually appropriate, but the Commission has not sufficiently taken into account the priorities of the individual countries in the field of human rights.
Projects have often not been well coordinated with other EU actions such as development aid and political dialogue.
They are usually implemented by involved and competent organisations.
The recommendations of the auditors concerned the targeting of financial resources, better coordination with other EU actions, the selection and improvement of project proposals, the measurement of results and the sustainability of beneficiary organisations.
The European Union acts by diplomatic means and grants grants to non-governmental organisations through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
• EU support to timber-producing countries under the FLEGT Action Plan (No 13/2015).The special report examines whether the Commission has managed well the support under the EU FLEGT Action Plan to combat illegal logging.
The auditors said that although the Action Plan is a positive initiative, the results are generally thinner.
The aid was not granted to timber-producing countries on the basis of clear criteria and its impact was weakened due to the large number of countries competing for aid.
These countries have made significant differences in progress.
Inappropriate progress is particularly due to the lack of appropriate planning by the Commission and the lack of clear priorities for the allocation of resources to wood producing countries.
The auditors recommended that the Commission set clear objectives and ways of achieving them.
Four Member States still need to fully implement the EU Wood Regulation, which was introduced to prevent illegal timber from being imported into the EU market.
Between 2003 and 2013, 35 countries received EUR 300 million under the Action Plan.
Two of these countries, Indonesia and Ghana, have made progress towards a full timber authorisation system.
Overall, little progress has been made, and many countries have encountered difficulties in overcoming obstacles to responsible policies.
Within 12 years of the Commission's implementation of the action plan, no partner country has been able to implement a fully recognised authorisation scheme.
Our actions 28 • ACP Investment Facility: does it offer added value?
(No 14/2015) This Special Report assesses whether the Investment Facility was an added value for EU development cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
The audit has shown that the Investment Facility has indeed added value to EU development cooperation with ACP countries and that it fully fits EU policy objectives.
At the end of 2014, the credit lines represented 28% of the instrument's portfolio compared with 14% at the end of 2010.
This increase reflects the continuing importance of the long-term financing offered under the instrument.
The instrument also acted as a catalyst in a positive sense by mobilising additional measures.
However, auditors found that the contractual obligation to inform the final beneficiaries of the financing by the European Investment Bank (EIB) or the Investment Facility is not always fulfilled, and technical assistance is not always targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises.
They have made recommendations to address these problems.
The ACP Investment Facility established in 2003 receives its capital from the European Development Fund and is managed by the EIB.
The instrument has approved development projects worth €5.7 billion over the last ten years.
The instrument provides medium- and long-term financing and aims to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits. • The promotion of renewable energy in Eastern Africa under the ACP-EU Energy Facility (No 15/2015) in this special report, in order to examine whether the Commission has successfully used the energy instrument in order to improve access to renewable energy of poor social groups in Eastern Africa.
The audit has shown that some significant successes have been achieved, but even better monitoring of the instrument is needed.
The Commission has made a good choice among the proposed projects but has not made sufficient close monitoring of the progress made in the implementation of the projects.
The reports of the project managers differed in quality and the Commission did not take any action to ensure compliance with the reporting requirements.
For projects known to have had serious problems, Commission staff have carried out insufficient on-the-spot visits and monitoring checks to supplement the information provided by the administrators.
The report sets out recommendations for more rigorous selection, better monitoring and more sustainable future projects.
By mid-2014 a total of EUR 268 million had been allocated, of which EUR 106 million had been allocated to projects in eastern Africa which had been allocated the lowest access to electricity in Africa.
Our actions 29 • Analysis of the risk of a performance-based approach to EU development and cooperation activities (No 21/2015) due to the increased interest that has recently been to shift the development and cooperation priorities of EU development and cooperation policy to results.
The auditors identified nine main threats: inconsistent terminology related to performance or inconsistent chain of actions, products, impacts and impacts; increased complexity related to the integration of cross-cutting issues into EU programmes; lack of harmonisation of aid instruments, performance frameworks and accountability structures of partners for development; shortcomings in the evaluation and evaluation of results; lack of consolidated reports or the compilation of results obtained from EU aid; lack of adequate, adequate, reliable and up-to-date data; focus on budgetary results as a target; change of the context of actions.
The audit showed that these risk areas were correctly identified by the Commission in a number of different documents.
Nevertheless, further action is needed to exploit the full potential of the Commission's initiatives and to improve the EU's development and cooperation performance.
A number of recommendations have therefore been drawn up which the Commission should take into account.
Our actions 30 100 80 60 40 20 0 Financial and economic governance The objective of the EU economic governance framework is to address problematic financial and economic trends, such as excessive public deficits and public debt, which can hamper economic growth and threaten the sustainability of public finances.
Under this framework, an EU banking union is established.
According to the 2014 European Banking Authority report, this special report was the second we published on the subject.
In 2008, Europe faced a financial crisis that has become a sovereign debt crisis.
The sovereign debt crisis was the consequence of various factors, such as weak banking supervision, insufficient fiscal policy and difficulties faced by large financial institutions (and the resulting costs of rescuing these institutions from society).
The crisis hit the EU Member States in two waves: in 2008-2009, it met countries outside the euro area and then spread to the euro area itself.
Our auditors examined how the European Commission managed the financial assistance provided under the Balance of Payments Instrument and the European Financial Stability Mechanism during the crisis, under which the Commission absorbed financial resources in the capital markets, with the EU budget as a guarantee.
The audit concerned financial assistance granted to Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Ireland and Portugal, with particular emphasis on the Commission's role in these programmes.
In addition, our auditors analysed the Commission's cooperation with its partners from the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt and with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington.
Evidence of verification was obtained through detailed review and analysis of documents and through discussions with Commission officials, national authorities, the ECB and the IMF.
The partners and decisions taken at EU political level were not subject to scrutiny.
The audit showed that the European Commission was not prepared for the first requests for financial assistance during the financial crisis in 2008, because no warning signals were included, which, to a large extent, explains the first significant shortcomings in its administrative processes.
The auditors identified four main areas of crisis management of the Commission: different approaches, limited quality control, insufficient monitoring and shortcomings in the documentation.
In some programmes, the conditions for granting aid were less stringent and easier to meet.
Furthermore, it was found that the Commission's teams had not carried out sufficient verification of the relevant documents, had not been verified by anyone outside the team, had not been thoroughly verified by the experts or had not been sufficiently documented by the verification procedures.
Our actions 31 In the view of the auditors, despite the lack of experience, the Commission has managed to carry out its new administrative tasks and to launch financial assistance programmes relevant to the reform process, which, given the pressure of time, must be considered to be a success.
In addition, the auditors found that, during the crisis, the Commission increasingly developed internal knowledge and cooperated with a number of stakeholders in the countries concerned, and that improved macro-economic surveillance was introduced during subsequent reforms.
For example, the objectives of the programmes have been achieved, the adjusted deficit targets have been achieved to a large extent, structural deficits have improved, and the Member States have fulfilled most of the conditions of their programmes, albeit with some delays.
In most cases, the countries continued the reforms under the programme, and in four out of five countries the current account adjustment was faster than expected.
Our auditors have noted that there are still a number of weaknesses and that the Commission needs to improve its financial aid management procedures.
We have made a number of recommendations to the European Commission to ensure that financial assistance is better managed in the future when Member States in difficulty ask for assistance.
This report was widely echoed, especially in European media, but also in the United States and Australia.
Like our other special reports, it is presented to the addressees in the European Parliament and the Council by our fellow Member, Mr Baudilio, in the São Tomé and Príncipe.

Our actions 32 • The supervision of EU credit rating agencies is based on solid grounds, but is not yet fully effective (No 22/2015) The special report examines whether the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) (ESMA) is effective in the supervision of credit rating agencies in the EU.
The financial crisis in 2008 increased the focus on credit rating agencies and their impact on financial markets.
At that time, credit rating agencies in Europe were, to a small extent, regulated.
The audit has shown that although ESMA has developed good grounds, its rules and guidelines are not complete and that there are still serious risks.
The auditors concluded that ESMA could reduce the average duration of the registration procedure but the procedure remains complex.
While rating methods should be rigorous, systematic, durable and validated, ESMA's activities focus primarily on whether these methods are rigorous.
The current Eurosystem credit assessment framework does not guarantee the same functioning of all credit rating agencies registered with ESMA, which creates a two-stage market structure which puts small credit rating agencies at a disadvantage.
The auditors made certain recommendations to ESMA on the registration procedure, the traceability of the risk detection procedure, supervisory procedures and information systems. • Technical assistance to Greece: Better making available requires a greater focus on results (No 19/2015) on the basis of this Special Report, to assess whether the Greece Task Force has fulfilled its mandate and whether technical assistance to Greece has effectively contributed to the reform process.
The Task Force was set up by the Commission in 2011 to support the economic adjustment of Greece by means of a number of technical assistance measures.
The auditors checked whether the task force had fulfilled its mandate and whether technical assistance had effectively contributed to the reform.
They obtained evidence from the Commission, service providers, Greek ministries and other interested parties.
The audit showed that the Greek authorities received technical assistance in accordance with the mandate, but that they did not always go well enough with the reforms.
Due to the urgency of the situation, the Task Force was set up in a short time and without a full analysis of other options or of its own budget.
The Task Force did not have a complex, comprehensive strategic document to provide technical assistance or to set priorities.
The aid was appropriate and largely in line with the requirements of the programme and the Task Force developed a flexible and diversified implementation system, but there were shortcomings at project level.

Our actions 33 Other 8.2 % 100 80 60 40 20 0 VAT 12.8 % TEM 13.3% % GNI 65.7 % revenue The EU budget is financed mainly from revenue from three types of own resources.
These include own resources based on gross national income (GNI) and VAT and traditional own resources (tem), in particular customs duties on products and sugar levies imported into the EU.
In addition, the EU receives taxes on the salaries of EU workers, contributions from third countries to certain EU programmes and fines from companies that violate EU rules and regulations.
EU expenditure must be fully covered by revenue.
In 2015, revenue amounted to EUR 141.3 billion. • Combating intra-Community VAT fraud: further action is needed (No 24/2015) The special report examines whether the EU is effectively combating intra-Community VAT fraud.
Because of organised crime, the European Union loses between EUR 40 billion and EUR 60 billion of VAT revenue each year.
Since exports of goods and services from one EU Member State to another are exempt from VAT, criminals in both countries may fraudulently delay taxes.
In this way, both the countries concerned and the EU lose their income.
During the audit, serious deficiencies were identified, indicating the insufficient effectiveness of the current system.
In order to combat intra-Community VAT fraud, the EU has a number of instruments, but some of these instruments need to be improved or more harmonised.
In most Member States that have visited, there are no effective cross-checks between customs and tax data; Member States' tax authorities exchange information on VAT, but there are problems regarding the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data; there is no cooperation and between administrative, judicial and judicial authorities.
In order to improve the system, action is needed by the Member States, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
Our actions 34 opinions in 2015. Our opinions on proposals for new or revised legislation with financial implications also contribute to improving EU financial management.
These opinions shall be issued at the request of the other EU institutions and shall be used by the legislative bodies at the request of the Parliament and the Council and shall be used by the Parliament and the Council.
We can also issue documents and analyses on our own initiative on other issues.
In 2015, we issued eight opinions on a number of important areas: • Opinion No 1/2015 on the proposal for a revision of the Financial Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union; • Opinion No 2/2015 on the proposal for a revision of the Financial Regulation of the Community Plant Variety Office; • Opinion No 3/2015 on the proposal for a Financial Regulation of the Single Resolution Committee; • Opinion No 4/2015 on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) (for further details in the framework); • Opinion No 5/2015 on the proposal for a revision of the Regulation of the Budget Committee of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market; • Opinion No 63/2015 on the proposal for a revision of the Financial Regulation of the Single Resolution Committee; • Opinion No 71/2015 on the proposal for a revision of the Regulation on traditional own resources based on VAT and GNI and the resources to make available the necessary financial resources; • Opinion No 84/2015 on the Proposal for a revision of the Financial Regulation on the European Development Fund.
In response to the fall in investment since 2007, the Commission launched an investment offensive for Europe in November 2014.
The Investment Plan is based on the logic of intervention on which there is a high demand for investment in Europe and on a number of economically viable projects for which sources of funding are sought.
The challenge is to make effective use of savings and liquidity to promote sustainable employment and growth in Europe.
The Investment Plan is to be implemented without burdening national budgets and new debt.
From this investment plan to its full implementation, the Commission promises to create between 1 million and 1.3 million new jobs and to mobilise additional (mainly long-term) investment funds of at least EUR 315 billion between 2015 and 2017.
To contribute to the success of this initiative, in our opinion, we have drawn attention to the issues of governance and the legal framework, the rules on accountability and external audit, as well as financial commitments for public budgets.
We also stressed that in the case of instruments in which the EU cooperates with the private sector, an adequate level of transparency and accountability should be ensured with regard to public funds.
In addition, the results of these instruments should be measured in order to achieve the objectives of the actions financed.
We have noted that the proposal does not explicitly describe the agreements between the Commission and the European Investment Bank.
Our opinion has been taken into account by regulatory authorities in Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 on EFSI.
Our actions 35 Our contribution to EU accountability through high-level events and conferences organise conferences on issues where we have identified threats and where our expertise can contribute to increasing EU accountability, increasing awareness of the importance of sound financial management and financial control of the EU.
In 2015, we organised two of the conferences described below, which correspond to our strategic objective of working with our partners in the EU process on reporting obligations.
During the year, we also organised seminars with internal and external experts to share knowledge about recent developments in EU policy and to use information to plan and conduct our audits.
For example, in October, a seminar was held on progress in the reform of the common agricultural policy, attended by representatives of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Conference of the Court on Energy Security in the EU On 5 May 2015 a conference on energy security in the EU took place in Brussels in order to provide a neutral and independent platform for stakeholders from EU institutions, Member States, the energy industry and universities to discuss the challenges facing the EU in the field of energy security.
Our President, Vítor Caldeira, opened the conference, and Maroš Šefčovič, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Commission, gave the introductory speech.
Our members: Szabolcs Fazakas and Phil Wynn Owen From left to right: Szabolcs Fazakas, Maroš Šefčovič, Vítor Caldeira and Phil Wynn Owen. A conference took place which included panel discussions on two main areas: obstacles to completion of the internal energy market and the important contribution of Ukraine to the European energy supply as an important transit country.
We have organised this conference because the EU is facing a number of challenges that are linked.
These include the creation of an internal energy market to increase the competitiveness of the European economy, the fight against climate change and energy security.
In our tests, we are increasingly focusing on energy and climate issues.
We have already prepared specific reports on issues such as the internal energy market and security of energy supply, energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Further reports are also planned in this area, including on EU support to Ukraine and EU expenditure on climate action, as well as on climate and energy analysis in the EU.
Our aim is to create added value for the EU's energy policy, and thanks to this conference, we have shown that we also want to support the democratic debate on these issues.
Our actions 36 The Court's Conference on the Future of Development Assistance On 20-21 October 2015 in Luxembourg, we organised an international conference on European Development Assistance beyond 2015 on the occasion of the European Year for Development, the adoption of the new UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Luxembourg Presidency.
At the beginning of the two-day conference chaired by our Danièle Lamarque, the President of Vítor Caldeira, followed by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid in Luxembourg, Romain Schneider, on behalf of the EU Presidency, the President of the European Parliament Development Committee, Linda McAvan, EU Commissioner for Development Neven Mimica and UN Undersecretary-General Grete Faremo, spoke.
The conclusions of the conference were summarised by Marc Angel, President of the Committee on Foreign and European Affairs, and by the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies.
The EU is the world's largest donor of development aid and cooperates with many public and private partners, including international organisations, foundations, NGOs and countries.
It is becoming increasingly important to ensure that aid is effective, which can be achieved through careful compliance with the criteria for the allocation and evaluation of aid.
In this context, the Court plays a huge role.
The new UN Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030 are more ambitious than the previous Millennium Development Goals and encourage the addressees to think and act differently.
Participants agreed that development aid must be adapted to environmental, energy and migration policies and to other policies and that new stakeholders should be involved.
Moreover, development agencies need to adapt to the increasing diversification of funding and financial instruments: innovative financial instruments contribute to increasing leverage and to increasing convergence with market conditions, but at the same time make it difficult to make financial decisions and to identify the added value of the aid.
The European Commission has given a lecture on how a result-oriented budget should look like, in which it has clearly defined how EU spending and results should be spent.
The Court also participates in a joint interinstitutional working group set up for this purpose.
Our actions 37 Relations with the addressees The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union The value of our contribution to the EU's accounting obligation depends to a large extent on the benefits our main partners will reap from our work and products in the legislative and accountability process.
These partners are the political bodies responsible for public oversight of the use of EU funds: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and national parliaments.
In line with our strategy for 2013-2017, we have paid particular attention to improving our working relations with Parliament and the Council.
The President and the Members of the Court shall maintain regular contacts with the committees of the European Parliament, in particular with the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT), which is our most important partner.
In 2015, President Vítor Caldeira presented our annual work programme and our annual reports at two CONT meetings and presented the annual reports at two Parliament plenary sessions and took part in the debate on discharge.
On the initiative of Ville Itälä, our Commissioner for Institutional Relations, President Caldeira presented our 2015 work programme also at the Conference of Committee Chairs and took note of their priorities to plan our 2016 work programme.
In October 2015, CONT carried out a working visit to the Court, continuing the practice of annual bilateral meetings at the Court's premises in Luxembourg. In addition, our representatives participated in visits to the Member States (Greece) and to the beneficiary countries (Serbia) organised by CONT.
In 2015, our members represented the Court in 29 CONT meetings to discuss our annual and special reports.
In addition, our members have submitted nine special reports to the Committees concerned.
We also held a joint meeting with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and the Environment to discuss issues of common interest and we started working with Parliament's Scientific Service to promote a more effective exchange of knowledge between our control chambers and services.
We also worked with the Council to strengthen and strengthen relations with the Council and its Presidency.
In November, during the Luxembourg Presidency, President Caldeira and Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg's Finance Minister and President of the Ecoco and Financial's Council, met during the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council to discuss further actions under the 2014 discharge procedure on the basis of our 2014 annual report.
As part of the various Council working groups, we presented our work programme for 2015 and 15 special reports.
We also presented the various chapters of the annual report to the Committee on Budgets of the Council as the basis for the discharge procedure.
Annual meeting of the Court's representatives with the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control.
Our actions 38 Strengthening partnership with national parliaments and national authorities During the year we have worked closely with our addressees in the Member States.
National Parliaments have systematically informed us about our work.
In addition, the President and the Members of the Court presented an annual report to the parliaments and national authorities of most Member States.
In addition, meetings with representatives of national parliaments and bodies took place at the Court and in the Member States.
We continued our initiative, launched in 2014, in order to organise high-level visits in EU Member States to deepen our partnerships with the national authorities responsible for EU financial management and control.
In April 2015, the High-level delegation of the Court went to Poland to highlight the importance of financial control and public responsibility in relation to EU funds, to increase the Court's visibility and to start a dialogue with the Polish authorities concerned.
These included meetings with the president of Poland, Bronisław Komorowski, the head of the Prime Minister's firm, both chambers of parliament, state authorities and local authorities, and in particular with ORB Poland.
Discussions focused primarily on public responsibility and control, as well as a recent analysis of EU legislation on public responsibility and control.
Meetings with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development were an opportunity to discuss our analysis of the Landscape, the results of relevant research and best practices.
Our delegation has visited two projects funded by the EU and one is managed by the public authorities and the other by a private beneficiary.
The high-level visit to Poland was supplemented by visits to the Czech Republic (June 2015) and Bulgaria (November 2015).
In the Czech Republic, our representatives met with the Czech President Miloš Zeman, the Prime Minister and representatives of Parliament.
In addition, they took part in a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Chamber of Deputies, which discussed the results of the audits of the common agricultural and cohesion policy in the previous programming period, which were relevant to the Czech Republic.
During this visit, our representatives contributed to the conference on electronic data and to its importance for future inspections organised by the ORKB of the Czech Republic.
During her visit to Bulgaria, our delegation met with the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Rosen Plevneliev, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, the President of Parliament, Tsetska Tsafteva and other representatives of Parliament.
In addition, members of the delegation took part in a conference on the importance of external control for the effective management of the public sector, organised on the 135th anniversary of the establishment of the ORB of Bulgaria and on the 20th anniversary of the resumption of activities.
From left to right: Vítor Caldeira (President of the European Court of Auditors), Krzysztof Kwiatkowski (President of the ORKB of Poland) and Augustine cubic (member of Poland of the European Court of Auditors).
Our activities 39 Cooperation with the highest audit authorities The Court cooperates with other highest audit authorities (ORKBs), mainly through the ORKB Contact Committee of EU Member States; • the ORKB Network of candidate countries and potential candidate countries; • the International Organisation for the Control of Public Finances, in particular the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) and their European Regional Group (EUROSAI).
The Contact Committee of the Supreme Audit Authorities of the EU Member States In accordance with the EU Treaty, the Court and the national audit authorities shall cooperate with each other with full confidence, while maintaining their independence.
Cooperation with CMRs of EU Member States is actively conducted within the Contact Committee, including within the framework of an annual meeting and various working groups, networks and task forces dealing with specific issues of common interest.
In 2015, a Contact Committee meeting took place in Riga.
At the meeting, the members of the Contact Committee discussed the issue of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the prevention and eradication of irregularities and fraud and the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.
The issues concerning the Single Supervisory Mechanism have also been addressed.
The Contact Commission has adopted a statement on the principles of accountability and financial control of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, addressed to national parliaments and governments, as well as to the EU institutions and bodies concerned.
In addition, the Contact Committee agreed with the proposal to carry out parallel checks on the implementation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the contribution of the Structural Funds to the Europe 2020 strategy and the associated risks to the sustainability of public finances.
In November 2015, the Court launched the inaugural meeting of the Working Party on the Structural Funds VII. In order to determine to what extent EU financial support in the field of education and employment contributes effectively to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.
The network of the highest audit bodies of candidate countries and potential candidate countries Cooperation between the Court of Auditors of candidate countries and potential candidate countries shall be carried out primarily through a network1 which is comparable to the Contact Committee.
In 2015, we continued to support the network in carrying out a parallel energy efficiency assessment.
The last workshop devoted to this project took place in May 2015 at the Court's premises in Luxembourg.
The Court participates in the preparation of new projects to start in 2016 and which focus on audits and accounting audits.
In May 2015, the Court's representatives took part in the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the creation of the Court of Auditors.
To this end, President Caldeira and President of the Republic of Albania Bujar Nishani met.
Eight ORKB examiners took part in our internship program for 2015.
1 In January 2015, the network included six candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey) and a potential candidate country (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
Since November 2013, Kosovo* has been participating in the network as an observer. * This name does not affect positions on Kosovo's status and is in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the declaration of Kosovo's independence.
Our 40 multilateral activities (INTOSAI EUROSAI) and bilateral cooperation In 2015, we continued to actively participate and participate in INOSAI and EUROSAI activities, in particular in the relevant working bodies.
In November, starting with the International Congress of Supreme Audit Authorities (INCOSAI) at the end of 2016, the Court was appointed Vice-President of the INTOSAI Technical Standards Committee.
We also shared the request of the ORB of Ukraine, which chair the working group on the assessment of disaster aid, to host the first meeting of this working group.
The Court is also an active member of the EUROSAI Task Force on Evaluation and Ethics, which wishes to promote ethical behaviour and integrity in the ORB and public institutions.
The main objective of the Task Force is to establish and strengthen the framework for promoting ethical behaviour by making available to EFSA appropriate practical guidelines and tools to support daily research.
We took part in the fifth EUROSAI-ARABOSAI Joint Conference on the supervision of State aid plans and the second Young-EUROSAI Conference, which gave young auditors the opportunity to discuss current issues.
We also visited the World Leader Forum, the main theme of which was the role of public sector auditors in 2030.
The Court maintains good bilateral relations with other ORBs.
For example, in 2015 our delegation participated in an international seminar organized by ORB Poland for auditors from Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine in Warsaw.
The members of the delegation spoke with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia about their experience with the development and capacity building in order to prepare for accession to the EU and gave training on our methods of checking compliance with the law and compliance with the law.
Cooperation with ORBs in international peer reviews (expert assessment) is a widely used method of promoting good practices and promoting quality assurance.
The INTOSAI Sub-Committee shall be responsible for updating the ISSAI 5600 peer review guide (ISSAI means the International Standard of Supreme Audit Authorities).
In 2015, we contributed significantly to the review of this guide, which will be adopted by the INCOSAI Congress in 2016.
In addition, we played a leading role in international peer reviews of the ORKB of Latvia, Spain and Switzerland.
The Commission considers that, in view of the fact that, due to the fact that the Commission considers that, due to the fact that the Commission considers that, due to the fact that the Commission considers that the Commission does not consider the fact that the Commission has infringed the State aid rules, it is not appropriate to consider that the State aid is compatible with the internal market, because the State aid cannot be considered compatible with the internal market because the State aid cannot be considered compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU, Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU, Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU and Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU should be considered compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU, Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU, Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU, and Article 107 (3) (c) of the TFEU.
The technical evaluation of the ORKB in Spain, led by the ORKB in Portugal, also covered many aspects of the functioning of the ORKB.
During the expert evaluation of the Swiss ORKB, we were the only observers.
The evaluation assessed the appropriateness of the strategy and its planning and quality control processes.

Our governance 43 The Court's 2013-2017 strategy: Continuous progress Our five-year strategy aims to maximise the value of our contribution to the EU's social responsibility.
Our main priority for achieving this goal is the following graph: many initiatives launched under the strategy have already been implemented.
We have expanded the product range, strengthened and expanded our relationship with our addressees, accelerated our research and improved the way we measure our own results.
In 2015, the Court decided to reform its organisational structure.
In this way, we will take into account the European Parliament's recommendations on the future role of the Court and the results of the international peer review procedure carried out in 2014 in relation to our performance controls.
The Court's strategic priorities for 2013-2017: RECOGNIZING THE COURT'S PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE THE EU'S REFERENCE TO COOPERATION WITH US PARTNERS IN THE COURT'S PARTNERS IN THE COURT'S PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH PARTICIPANTS IN THE PARTICIPATION AND THE PARTICIPATION OF THE EU'S REPRESENTATION IN THE COURT'S PARTICIPATION AND PARTICIPATION WITH THE PARTICIPATION IN THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PARTICIPATION AND IN THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PARTICIPATION AND OF THE NEWS TO THE NEWS AND NEWS OF THE INSURANCES OF THE COURT'S INFLUENCE IN THE INFLUENCE OF INFLUENCES AT THE START OF THE PARTICIPATION AND IN THE NEWS OF THE INFLUTION TO THE NEWS AND NEWS OF THE INFLUSIONS TO THE INFLUSIONS IN THE INFLUSIONS TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE 01 05 02

Our management 45 Flexible response in a rapidly changing environment We have developed a new process of planning work that will allow us to plan our work based on our priorities and comprehensive risk assessment, based on the whole Court.
At present, we systematically take the views of the addressees into account when planning our work, in order to ensure that our reports are as important as possible.
With the help of our Member of the European Parliament responsible for institutional relations, our President and Members shall cooperate with EU citizens, including the European Parliament's committees.
Flexible provision of resources for priority control tasks We have organised our staff in flexible teams around specific tasks, not in departments, in order to facilitate the allocation of priority tasks.
This means that now we can use the right person to work fully using its skills and potential.
The reform also led to improved management of the Court: the heads of departments have become management managers who, under the direction of the Director, share management tasks and share quality and supervisory expertise.
We also strengthen our research expertise and introduce knowledge transfer tools to further improve our knowledge management processes.
Product delivery speed We have simplified our control procedures and simplified our task management so that we can deliver our products in good time.
In recent years, we have constantly reduced the average time needed to prepare our special reports and the reform will allow for further shortening.
This is particularly important in the context of the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation.
Better communication on our role and our work We revised our annual report to refer to the headings of the multiannual financial framework and thus to be easier to use and clearer.
In the annual report, we are now presenting a few years' report on the main expenditure areas and the results.
In addition, we have strengthened the communication and relations functions with the addressees, and we have hired one spokesperson.
Our management 46 Performance measurements Since 2008 we have been using key performance indicators (ZLIs) to inform management about progress in achieving our goals, to support decision-making and to inform our addressees about results.
They reflect our priorities and define our achievements and accountability as a professional examination body.
These indicators measure the basic parameters of the quality and impact of our work, with particular emphasis on the views of the main recipients and the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources.
The ZLIs were updated for the period covered by the strategy for 2013-2017.
Quality and impact of our work We assess the quality and impact of our reports based on the assessments carried out by the addressees and assessments carried out by experts.
In addition, we measure our presence in the media.
We called on our main addressees to call on the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament, the Committee on Budgets of the Council, the main bodies that have been audited in the Commission and in the EU agencies, and the EU-ORKB Presidents to assess the usefulness and impact of our reports published in 2015, on a scale from very low to very high on a scale of five steps from........
The answers show that 90% of our main addressees assess the value of our reports as suitable for their work (compared with 94% in 2014). 92% believe that our work is producing results (91% in 2014).
Rating of recipients 10% 21% 45% 24% 2% 0 % very low 20% average 40 % very high Properties of reports Probably impact of reports 60 % 80 % 100% 6% 23% 45% 24%
Our management 47 reviews carried out by experts Every year independent external experts review the content and present a sample of our reports for quality assessment. In 2015, the auditors assessed the four special reports and the annual reports for the financial year 2014.
They assessed the quality of the various aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale to a large extent affected in (1) the most valuable value on (4).
The assessment of experts in 2015 was higher in comparison with the previous four years, compared with a total average of 3,3 for both types of reports.
Follow-up to the recommendations We contribute primarily to improving the EU's financial management by making recommendations to the Commission and other bodies audited in our reports.
Some recommendations can be quickly implemented while others require more time due to their complexity.
We regularly check to what extent our recommendations have been implemented by the evaluation bodies.
By the end of 2015, 73% of the more than 600 recommendations we have made in 2012-2015 have been implemented.
This represents an increase compared to 69 % of the 2014 implementation rate in relation to the recommendations issued in 2011-2014.

It concerns the strategic objective of raising the Court's awareness of its products, its findings of the audit and the conclusions of the audit.
In 2015, we identified about 3400 online articles on our special reports, annual reports and the Court in general.
54% of them concerned our audit reports and the other articles referred to the Court and to its work in general.
In 2015, almost twice as many of our annual reports were reported in the media as in 2014.
However, the number of media reports on our special reports has decreased since 2014, mainly because of the interest in the report in question this year (airport infrastructure financed by the EU (No 21/2014) on which more than 800 articles have been published).
Resource efficiency and efficiency We assess the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use, depending on the extent to which we are able to implement our work programme, carry out audits in good time and ensure the competence of our employees.
Implementation of the work programme We plan our audit tasks and others based on the annual work programme and monitor the progress of the year.
In 2015, we launched our work programme at 88%.
While the work on the annual reports and the special annual reports was carried out as planned, in the case of special reports, compared to our very ambitious planning, this was 69%.
The completion of the remaining special reports, which were delayed due to the lack of evidence from the audit or unexpected complexity, was carried over at the beginning of 2016.
Special reports concern mainly new or innovative audits which may take longer to complete due to their nature.
The Court's draft reform, assessed for other tasks, was in line with the plan.
Implementation of the Court's 2015 work programme 100 % 80 % 60 % 40 % 20% 20% 0% of the special reports Annual reports Other tasks Total 69 % 100 % 88 %
Our management 49 Preparation of special reports In order for our special reports to be effective, they must be submitted in good time.
In recent years, we have managed to reduce the time needed to carry out the audit, mainly on the basis of initiatives resulting from the 2013-2017 strategy.
In 2015, we prepared 25 special reports over an average period of 17 months (19 months in 2014), for the first time in less than 18 months.
We will continue our efforts to reduce the time needed to prepare our special reports, in particular in response to the new rule introduced by the amended Financial Regulation.
Vocational training In accordance with guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), we try to provide each auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of vocational training (except language courses).
The objective of vocational training of controllers has been again exceeded, which shows how important we attach to the development of human resources.
In 2015, taking into account language courses, one examiner represented an average of 9.4 days of training.

Support for 50 control actions Human resources Allocation of human resources In 2015 we continued to reduce human resources by 1% per year by five years (2013-2017), in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2013 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management.
As a result, 872 workers (excluding members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees) were employed in 2015 out of 882 temporary staff in 2015 (excluding members, contract staff, seconded national experts and trainees).
The controller's staff consisted of 562 staff, including 113 staff in the members' office.
The Court's staff have a broad academic and professional background and the quality of their work and their commitment are reflected in the Court's results.
Our recruitment policy is in line with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and includes both officials and temporary staff.
In 2015, we employed 63 people: 30 officials, 17 temporary staff, 11 contract staff, four seconded national experts and one consultant.
In addition, we provided 74 graduates with traineeships for a period of between three and five months.
On 31 December 2015, the Court had only 15 vacancies (1.7% of the total number of jobs).

Support for controls 51 Balance between men and women Like other EU institutions, we are pursuing a policy of equal opportunities for human resources management and recruitment.
For several years now, we have been able to maintain the balanced participation of men and women among our employees.
The chart shows men and women at the level of responsibility at 31 December 2015 which have changed slightly in recent years.
Our action plan on equal opportunities aims to achieve a balanced participation of women and men at all levels.
According to the latest recruitment waves, 50% of AD 5 to AD staff are 8 women (an increase of 48% in 2014).
In the future, the participation of women in management positions is expected to increase as a result of the renewal at higher and medium management levels and the increasing participation of women in the AD functional group.

32 of 69 directors and managers (46%) are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, the next five to ten years, when these workers retire, will result in a renewal in higher management positions.
Support services Vocational training The profession of controller requires continuous training to keep up with professional development and acquire new skills.
In 2015, our employees completed an average of 7.3 days of vocational training.
The participation of language courses in the total number of training days is still falling.
Language courses accounted for 35% of the total number of training days in 2015 (compared with 43% in 2014).
Our main vocational training activities concern the modernisation of our training programmes and closer cooperation with learning opportunities both within and outside the EU institutions.
We have requested cooperation with the University of Lorraine (Nancy, France) to offer post-graduate studies, public and political studies, public and master's studies and master's studies in the management of public organisations.
Cooperation with the European Commission has continued, which offers language courses for our staff and with the European Administration School, which has helped us organise training courses on personal skills in the field of training on personal skills in ECA and ECA day training.
In addition, we have increased our offer of courses through individual e-learning courses and training in the form of integrated learning (blended learning).
We have also continued our successful series of presentations organised by internal and external experts on the development of audit and other issues related to the work of our auditors.
Finally, we have introduced a framework for awards for workers who do not work in managerial positions in order to provide special training outside the Court.
Support for control activities 54 Translation Translation is a control support activity that allows us to do our job and achieve our communication objectives.
In 2015, total volume of translations was as high as ever: almost 200,000 pages and an increase of almost 3% compared to 2014.
About 99% of translations were completed according to deadlines.
In addition to normal translation work, during 26 EU-wide audit visits, our translators provided language support and interpretation during internal events and meetings.
In addition, they supported the preparation of preliminary comments and special reports and, in this way, they were more involved in the key audit processes of the Court.
In 2015, the Translation Directorate (DG Translation) optimised its structures by introducing a pool of assistants.
The large project of the GroupShare Directorate will lead to significant improvements by further improving the work of the assistant teams in order to create space to increase efficiency and automation and to harmonise the procedures of all language teams.
Information Technologies In 2015, the Directorate for Information Technologies focused its efforts on adapting our administrative information systems to support the successful implementation of the Court's reform and on preparing for the development of knowledge management to support the Court's new organisational structure.
In addition, all functions of the full Assist2 audit documentation system have been put in place for the work related to the assurance, performance audit and related reports, which means the completion of this major project.
Our new audit management system (AMS) has been launched: more than 300 plans have been created in the system and 180 audit tasks have been identified and monitored by the tool.
Based on the technical basis of mobility introduced in recent years (the provision of Wi-Fi in all areas of the Court, the equipment of all laptop employees), the Directorate is currently focusing on global mobility, i.e. access to all content anywhere, at any time and on all devices.
The project to develop a solution to ensure that employees have access to our information on all devices will help to maintain the functioning of the Court and to increase its effectiveness and effectiveness.
The maintenance of operations during the development and delivery of IT solutions was ensured and the critical systems were 99.82% available.
Support for control activities 55 Management and infrastructure The task of the Directorate for Finance and Support Services is to provide adequate resources, services and infrastructure to enable the Court to fulfil its tasks and fulfil its strategic objectives.
The Directorate shall also ensure that the necessary internal control, internal control and accounting mechanisms are available to support all the Court's activities.
In 2015, the Directorate continued to focus on making its activities more efficient and efficient.
Due to the exceptional situation following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November and following the crisis in Belgium, we have tightened our security measures and acquired the necessary security support in public procurement.
Information on public procurement is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
The Farm House currently has three buildings (including K1w, K2w and K3w) and leases small areas to the IT center for data recovery and to the conference room.
In addition, the European Parliament rents three offices in Brussels and one office in Strasbourg.
To ensure the cost-effectiveness of our building policy, we take into account three factors: purchasing or renting, purchasing costs and interinstitutional cooperation.
In developing and implementing our building policy, as in all areas of our business, we aim to establish and meet the highest standards of transparency and accountability.
The Community Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) The Community Environmental Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) is an instrument for business management and other organisations developed by the European Commission to assess, report and improve their environmental performance.
In 2014, we started developing an environmental management system2 which complies with the principles set out in the European EMAS standard set out in the 2009 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.3.
Our goal is to certify EMAS by the end of 2016.
In 2015, the EMAS project made the planned progress.

Supporting control measures 58 The Court, like the other EU institutions, is subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2015, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2013, which means that our 2013 annual accounts have been definitively approved.
We have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our responsibility for control and management, and we have taken appropriate action in the framework of our reform.
We have notified the European Parliament of our follow-up.
Internal audit and external audit The internal audit department shall provide advice to the Court on risk control by issuing opinions on the quality of internal management and control systems and recommendations to improve the management of our operations and to promote sound financial management.
In addition, the services support the work of an external auditor, the task of which is to certify the Court's annual accounts.
Finally, the Internal Audit Department provides information on the significant risks and issues of corporate governance.

The Committee shall regularly monitor progress in the implementation of the various tasks set out in the work programme of the Internal Audit Unit.
The Committee shall also ensure the independence of the internal audit department.
In 2015, the Internal Audit Service prepared specific reports on strategic issues such as the changes in our annual report, the mid-term review of the implementation of our 2013-2017 strategy and the monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations under the peer review procedure and the European Parliament.
Taking into account the recommendations of the 2014 Internal Audit Agency that the internal control cycle should be strengthened, we have updated our IT security system and formalised the existing risk management framework and existing guidelines.
The Internal Audit Department monitored the implementation of the new guidelines and ensured that their recommendations were taken into account.
Every year we report to the European Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal audit.
External audit of the Court Our financial statements are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same principles of transparency and accountability that apply to the authorities that it has carried out.
The auditor's report: PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à r. l.: The annual report for the financial year 2014 was published on 15 September 2015.
Supporting the audit activities 59 Independent auditor's opinions As regards the financial statements for the financial year 2014: In our view, the annual accounts provide a true and fair view of the financial situation of the European Court of Auditors as at 31 December 2014 and of its results and cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules for the application of the Financial Regulation.

The European Court of Auditors 02 Court of Auditors The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is an external auditor of the EU and one of the seven institutions of the Union.
The College of the Court has 28 members, one of each EU Member State.
The Court employs around 900 employees from all EU countries, which consist of auditors and administrative staff.
It was built in 1977 and is based in Luxembourg.

Preface of the President 04 Dear Reader, Reader!
In 1977, the European Court of Auditors started operations 40 years later, when we successfully contributed a lot of resources to the EU's public responsibility and financial management.
In October 2017, an official ceremony took place on the occasion of the anniversary of the Hof Jubilee with the participation of Her Majesty the Grand Duke and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, President of the Republic of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid, President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
Their participation in the event is to a large extent evidence of the importance of the Court as a financial institution of the European Union.
But within a year, we looked to the future.
In this way, we discussed and agreed on a strategy for the remaining three years of the current multiannual financial framework by the end of 2020.
Our citizens need access to clear and reliable information so as not to lose confidence in the EU and its bodies.
People need to see that the EU works honestly, respects the rule of law, uses public funds wisely, has clear political goals and achieves the goals it has promised.
As an external EU controller, we are well prepared to examine these aspects and to report on these aspects.
We have issued special reports throughout the year on a wide range of EU policies and programmes and based on an analysis of publications such as land analysis and rapid analysis.
In addition, we have prepared several opinions on legislative proposals and on our annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the European Development Fund, as well as on EU agencies and many other bodies of the European Union, as was the case every year.
This activity report provides a comprehensive overview of our activities in 2017 and provides important information on the Court, its budget and its staff.
Klaus-Heiner Lehne President
2017 look 05 Our actions Our management • 28 special reports analysing effectiveness and • the added value of EU policies and programmes in areas such as youth unemployment, the environment, migration and banking union; • the analysis of EU action on energy and climate change and the rapid analysis of employment reductions in EU institutions; • five opinions on new or revised EU legislation, including the opinion on the Financial Regulation on the EU budget and the opinion on the financing of European political parties; • the annual reports on the implementation of the EU budget and actions under the European Development Fund, together with the 2016 EU Review Report on the Financial Regulation; • 55 special annual reports on the annual accounts of individual EU agencies, bodies and joint undertakings, including two summary reports; • meetings, seminars and conferences with our institutional addressees and with our counterparts, including meetings of the Climate Change Contact Committee, Climate Change and Conferences on Climate Change.
We welcomed two new members: Juhan Parts (Estonia) on 1 January 2017 and Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz (Hungary) on 1 September 2017 • We issued a new multi-annual strategy that serves as a guide to our work and management in 2018-2020. We also revised our work plan to ensure a more strategic, coherent and applied approach to the whole Court to the planning of our control priorities. We also examined our risk management policy and strengthened our financial procedures. • We continued to remove the positions agreed among the EU institutions while implementing a policy of equal opportunities for the recruitment and management of human resources.
Our activities 06 Audits We carry out various types of controls in various areas of the EU budget: • Performance audits take into account the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EU policies and programmes.
The checks on the optimal use of funds focus on specific management issues or budgetary issues that we choose on the basis of criteria such as public interest, potential for improvement, risk of insufficient results or irregularities; • accounting audits and compliance audits that take into account the reliability of the financial statements, the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions (in particular as regards the Statement of Assurance) and the assessment that systems or transactions in specific budgetary areas comply with the relevant rules and regulations.
Based on the evidence gathered during our audit work, our reports have made clear conclusions on the achievement of the EU policy objectives and on the situation of the Union's budgetary and financial management.
This information will help us to formulate appropriate cost-efficiency recommendations.
A check-up visit in 2017 Most of the audit work takes place at the Court's premises in Luxembourg.
At the same time, in 2017, our auditors also carried out numerous visits to other EU institutions, agencies and bodies and EU delegations, to national, regional and local bodies in the Member States and to international organisations such as the United Nations, involved in the allocation of EU funds.
In addition, we carry out on-the-spot checks on beneficiaries of EU funds within and outside the European Union.
These controls provide direct evidence of controls from stakeholders involved in the management of EU policies and programmes and in the collection and payment of EU funds as well as from the relevant beneficiaries.
The audit is our main task The frequency and intensity of our audit work in individual Member States and beneficiary countries depends on the type of controls we carry out.
In 2017, our auditors spent 3,670 days on on-the-spot checks in the Member States and outside the EU (2016: 4 246 days).
In the EU, on-the-spot checks are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities of the Member States visited.
In addition, in 2017 in the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as in decentralised agencies and agencies across the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations and the OECD, as well as audit firms, our auditors spent 2 300 days (2016: 2 510 days).
In order to obtain and approve examination evidence, we are increasingly using video conferencing and other information technologies (such as secure data and documents exchange).

Our actions 08 Detecting fraud In the fight against fraud from the EU budget, we work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
It shall then take a decision on a possible investigation and, where appropriate, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
In 2017, we gave OLAF 13 alleged cases of fraud under our control, although our controls are not specifically designed to detect fraud, we sometimes fall into cases where we suspect irregularities or frauds during our audit work.
In 2017, we handed over 13 such cases to OLAF (2016: 11 cases) where fraud was suspected. We suspected fraud as part of our audit activity on assurance of financial years 2016 and 2017 as well as other audit tasks.
Publications Our publications: Special reports, annual reports, opinions and publications based on analysis Our audit reports and opinions are an important link in the EU's liability chain, as they are used to be held responsible by the bodies responsible for the management of the EU budget, in particular as part of the annual discharge procedure.
In shared management areas, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States play an important role, as in the case of agricultural and cohesion expenditure, and in this way around 80% of the EU budget is implemented.
Our range of publications includes: • specific reports showing the results of selected audits on specific policy areas or expenditure or budgetary or management-related issues; • annual reports containing mainly the results of accounting audits and audits of compliance with the rules on the budget of the European Union and the European Development Fund, but also on financial management and performance-related aspects; • specific annual reports on the agencies, decentralised bodies and joint undertakings of the EU; • opinions on new or amended legal acts with a significant impact on financial management, drawn up at the request of another institution or on the Court's own initiative;
Our activities 09 • Publications based on analysis: • Landscape analyses are descriptive and analytical documents on complex and broad policy areas or management issues, in which we often present from a cross-cutting perspective our experiences and knowledge on the selected subject; • Thematic analyses are similar to Landscape analyses, as they are also descriptive and analytical documents on policy or management, but their topics are more limited; • Rapid Case Reviews generate and present facts related to very clearly defined topics or problems.
All publications are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
In addition, all special reports, opinions and publications based on the 2017 analysis at the end of this report are listed.

Our actions 10 Annual Implementation Reports for the EU Budget for the financial year 2016 In our Annual Implementation Report for the EU Budget for the financial year 2016 we examined how EU funds were used in the financial year under consideration, and in which areas the risk that EU funds were not used properly was the greatest.
In addition, we have made a specific assessment of all important areas of the EU budget, based on the headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, in order to provide information on budgetary and financial management and on results.
We also looked at why errors were made and made recommendations for possible improvements.
The audit of around 1000 payments made to beneficiaries from the EU budget for 2016. Our auditors examined around 1000 payments made to beneficiaries in various areas of EU budget expenditure.
This means that we have analysed about 1000 different cases where EU funds have been used to support key infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in EU Member States, or to support non-EU beneficiaries.
With our 2016 annual report, the discharge procedure begins, the publication of our annual report begins at the beginning of the discharge procedure for the European Parliament for the implementation of the EU budget.
On 28 September we presented our annual report to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) and then to the plenary session of the European Parliament, the Ecofin Council and the national parliaments of the Member States.
Our actions 11 The EU annual accounts present a true and fair picture; the proportion of irregular expenditure continued to fall in 2016. The main conclusions in 2016 are based on international financial statements and in all the relevant aspects present a true and fair picture of EU funding. in 2016 the revenue in 2016 was not to a large extent affected by errors. not to a large extent. In recent years the estimated error rate of payments from the EU budget has steadily improved: 2016: 3,1%, 2015: 3,8% and 2014: 4,4%.
In 2016, a significant proportion of the expenditure audited In most cases, entitlements-based payments (as opposed to payments based on reimbursement).... (as opposed to payments based on reimbursement of expenditure) were not largely related to errors.... In most cases, the Commission's reports on regularity are largely consistent with our results.
However, the Commission should simplify the measurement of results, e.g. by reducing the number of objectives and indicators...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Without these measures, the overall estimated error rate would be 1.2 percentage points higher.
However, sufficient information was available to prevent, detect and correct a significant proportion of errors..... The total amount of payments to which the EU has committed under future budgets was as high as never before, and is likely to continue to grow.
Our actions 12 The annual report on the implementation of the EU budget contains for the first time a limited audit opinion on the regularity of EU expenditure Lazaros S. Lazarou, a member of the Court responsible for the annual accounts Unlimited audit opinion The error rate is less than 2% The limited audit opinion The error rate is more than 2%, but only for certain areas of the budget The unlimited audit opinion The error rate is more than 2%, but for the entire budget... The 2016 annual report is of historical importance as it differs significantly from the previous reports.
In the context of compliance on the expenditure side for the first time we issued an opinion with limited liability and were not disappointed... we compared the estimated error rates in the EU spending areas (2014-2016) with the estimated error rates of 5,7 5,6 2014 2015 5,2 4,4 4,4 4,1 3,6 2,9 2,5 2,8 2,1 0,6 0,5 in the area of expenditure on economic, social and territorial cohesion 0,2 in the area of Europe's competitiveness in terms of capacity to manage global growth and employment resources.
Our actions 13 Our institutional addressees also need information on the results of EU spending on the results of this year's EU R &amp; D spending assessment.
In future, we will re-examine the way we are analysing the EU budget: "We will take greater account of internal controls at the level of the European Commission and of the Member States in order to improve accountability and financial management of the EU."We will also pay greater attention to the efficiency aspects, in order to ensure the optimal use of EU funds in order to ensure the optimal use of EU funds in the EU."It is important to pay attention to the results and results of EU spending, as well as to whether the Structural Funds have been used, as well as to the information that Joachim Zeller, the Member of the European Parliament and the rapporteur for discharge in 2016, stressed: Klaus-Heiner Lehne, President of the European Court of Auditors, during the presentation of the annual report at the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 4 October 2017, as well as information on whether the Structural Funds have been used, but we should also look at what was achieved in 2016, as the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Joach Zell, Member of the European Parliament, Member of the European Parliament.
Our actions 14 Annual report on the European Development Funds Financial support is provided to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and overseas countries and territories.
The EDFs are financed by the Member States and managed by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) for certain assistance outside the EU budget.
Around one third of the total number of errors in the EFF is due to non-compliance with public procurement rules.
Other material types of errors relate, inter alia, to expenditure which has not actually been incurred or is not eligible.
Our annual report on the EDF will be published together with our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget and is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Special annual reports The agencies and other EU bodies and European Joint Undertakings are based in different EU Member States and carry out specific tasks in areas which are of key importance for EU citizens, such as health, security, freedom and justice and research.
In 2017, the Court examined whether the Agency's annual accounts were reliable and whether the underlying transactions were in accordance with the principles.
When preparing our opinions on the Agency's financial statements, if available, we took into account the audit work carried out by audit firms.
We have also examined the communication infrastructure of Sisnet, European schools, the conditional commitments of the Single Committee on Restructuring and Restructuring and the liquidation of the Galileo Joint Undertaking.
We have worked on consolidation of results and we expect to release only one report for the agencies in 2018. and the main figures of the EDF budget 2016 3.4 billion euro Verified amount of 2.8 billion euro Reliability of revenue Not caused by errors of payments to a large extent are burdened by errors (estimated error rate of 3.3%) and the main figures of the Court have examined 45 EU agencies and other bodies, 8 Joint Undertakings Budget 2016 a total of 5.2 billion euro Human resources in 2016. In total, around 11 000 employees, the Court has published 55 special annual reports, including two summary reports.
Our 15 agencies (budget of €3.4 billion, 10 364 employees) Our research has shown that the financial statements of all 41 agencies present a true and reliable picture of the situation.
The financial transactions underlying the annual accounts were legal and regular for all agencies, with the exception of the European Asylum Support Office, for which, due to non-compliance with the rules for the award of public contracts, we issued a limited opinion.
The Joint Undertaking (EUR 1.8 billion budget, 633 employees) The accounts of all eight Joint Undertakings were reliable.
The Commission therefore considers that, due to the fact that the Commission considers that, due to the fact that the Commission considers that the fact that the Commission does not constitute State aid does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or that State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or that State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or that State aid may not be regarded as State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, or (1) of the TFEU, or that State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU, may be regarded as State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TFEU.
Moreover, the transactions underlying the annual accounts were in line with the rules in force in the seven Joint Undertakings, with the exception of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, for which we gave a limited opinion, as we did not have sufficient assurance as to the reliability of its internal control with regard to the FP7 grants.
All the special annual reports and the two summary reports are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Special reports In 2017, we published 28 special reports.
In these reports, we have examined in particular whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved effectively and economically and whether the EU funds have added value.
We have also made recommendations on improving financial savings, improving working methods, preventing waste or more cost-effective achievement of the policy objectives.
Special reports examine in particular the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EU policies and programmes Our special reports focus on issues relevant to the EU, such as the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources, the creation of growth and the promotion of social inclusion, the challenges of migration and global development, the internal market and the banking union, and ensuring the accountability and cost-effectiveness of the European Union.
Here we will discuss two of the 28 special reports: the special report on food waste, in which we discussed whether EU policies were able to solve this problem throughout the food supply chain, and the special report on the Greek financial crisis, which looked at how the EU reacted in its economic adjustment programmes to the financial and debt crisis in one of its Member States.

Our actions 17 Special Report: Combating food waste: The EU's opportunity to increase resource efficiency in the food supply chain is the problem of food waste worldwide, which has become the centre of public and political debate in recent years, in particular in view of the need to feed the growing world population.
Current estimates indicate that around one third of food produced for human consumption worldwide is wasted or lost, resulting in high economic and environmental costs.
EU auditors have examined the role that the EU can play in combating food waste The Court's auditors have examined in particular the actions and the way in which the various EU policy instruments have been taken so far in order to reduce food waste.
The main objective was to prevent food waste and to facilitate food donation, as these two aspects are given priority in the fight against food waste.
Our auditors consulted the Commission officials responsible for the policy, carried out documentary checks and carried out checks in five Member States: Italy (Lazio), the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Finland.
They visited the appropriate ministries and visited the site.
In addition, they consulted relevant stakeholders in the field of food production, retail trade, research and charitable organisations. in the EU they can and should do more to effectively combat food waste. in., w.s.s.s.s.s.s.s.s., w.s.s.s.s.s., they have stated that although food waste can be combated through a number of EU policies, they do not exploit this potential.
The approach so far remains fragmented and inconsistent and coordination at Commission level is inadequate.
Our report identifies a number of unused opportunities and potential improvements that would not require new legislation or additional public resources, and the auditors have proposed that existing policies should be adapted more closely and that a clear policy objective should be set to reduce food waste.
The report was submitted to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council of the EU and many national parliaments across the EU.
Both the European Parliament and the Council welcomed and adopted the conclusions contained therein.
This report also met with a great deal of publicity in the media, in particular in social media.
Our actions 18 Special Report: The role of the Commission in the Greek financial crisis in Greece needed support to ensure financial stability After the financial crisis in 2008 there was an economic crisis and a debt crisis in Europe, which revealed the weaknesses of the Greek economy.
Greece was no longer able to finance itself in the financial markets in April 2010, and therefore requested financial assistance from the euro area Member States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Since then, Greece has participated in three economic adjustment programmes managed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF in the so-called Troika.
The third programme also involved the European Stability Mechanism (EMS).
The total amount of aid of EUR 368.6 billion was subject to the political conditions laid down jointly by the Greek authorities and creditors.
These programmes aimed at stabilising Greece's economic situation by meeting the financial needs of the Greek economy, which was intended to prevent the crisis being transferred to the rest of the euro area.
In return, Greece committed itself to carrying out extensive structural reforms.
EU auditors have examined whether the Commission has properly managed the economic adjustment programmes, which is part of a series of performance checks carried out by the Court in recent years, which have concerned measures and reforms taken in response to the financial crisis in 2008.
Our auditors assessed how the Commission applied the first two programmes for Greece and how it developed the third programme.
They examined documents relating to EU financial assistance programmes, examined the terms of the programmes and consulted the Commission staff, the staff of the national authorities (such as specialised ministries), the Bank of Greece, economic operators and economic operators, as well as the staff of the IMF, the European Stability Mechanism and the OECD.................adaptative economic programmes of Greece: despite shortcomings, progress in the reform process.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
However, in Greece, these programmes have only brought limited improvements.
Furthermore, the auditors found that the Commission had no experience in managing such a process, that the conditions of the programmes were not sufficiently high priority, were not included in a broader strategy for Greece, and that the macroeconomic assumptions of the programmes were not sufficiently clear.
This special report has been submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and to the institutional stakeholders in Greece.
This report was the subject of a wide media coverage and was the biggest media echo of all the special reports we published in 2017.

Our governance 28 Strategy The next three years will be a very important time for the European Union to make key decisions.
We are aware that EU citizens need access to clear and reliable information so that the EU can tackle the challenges effectively.
Citizens must see that the EU is acting honestly, that the rule of law is respected, that it is using taxpayers' money carefully, that it has clear objectives and that it achieves the objectives it has promised.
We can help this as an EU external controller.
Our strategy for 2018-2020: increasing confidence through external financial control In July 2017 we published our strategy for 2018-2020, which sets out four strategic objectives: • we provide clearly defined information to addressees; • we focus more on the aspects of the effectiveness of the EU's activities; • we increase the added value of the statement of assurance; • we focus on our products across the organisation.
Ultimately, the EU is not about numbers, but about people As part of external financial control, the Court can point out what is working and what is not working and what is not working, and can help EU citizens to answer the question of whether the EU institutions deliver results to them and thus contribute to increasing confidence in the EU.
In this context, the Court's audits must also take into account the concerns of European citizens, their main addressees at the last instance.
The 2018-2020 strategy sets out five priority areas for the Court's work in the coming years.
Sustainable management of natural resources and combating climate change Investments for cohesion, growth and integration The challenges of migration, security and sustainable development in the world The functioning internal market and the stable monetary union Financing and management of the Union while respecting accountability and cost-effectiveness
Our governance 29 During the development of our strategy, we have placed great emphasis on internal and external consultations.
We discussed strategies with our employees and asked Members of the European Parliament, representatives of the EU Member States, the European Commission, other supreme audit bodies and other non-institutional stakeholders, such as scientists, tankers, NGOs (NROs) and private sector controllers.
The Court's 2018-2020 strategy is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Planning Work In January 2017, we decided to introduce new procedures for planning work, which we first applied to our annual work programme for 2018, which was published in October last year.
Main changes to our work plan: • to draw up a list of audit tasks for the whole Court; • a centralised procedure for the selection of audit ideas, possible audit tasks and final audit conclusions; • a more flexible allocation of resources for and allocation of resources between each audit authority, taking into account the workload; • to extend the scope of products to audit tasks, the result of which is an analysis-based publication; • to identify audit tasks with a high priority to which shorter deadlines apply.
In addition, we agreed with the Conference of the Chairs of the European Parliament's committee on a procedure whereby all Parliament's permanent committees can propose to the Court any subject of scrutiny.
The Court's 2018 work programme is available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Measurement of results In 2013-2017 we used seven key performance indicators (KPIs) to inform management of progress in achieving our goals, to support decision-making and to inform our addressees of our achievements.
These indicators were intended to measure the basic parameters of quality and impact of our work, paying particular attention to the view of the main recipients and the effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of resources.
A revised set of performance indicators will be introduced in 2018 and will be valid for the period 2018-2020.
Quality and impact of our work We have assessed the quality and impact of our reports on the basis of the assessments of the addressees and assessments carried out by experts and on the basis of our recommendations on improving the EU's financial management.
Our management 30 Evaluation of the addressees We have asked the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament, the Committee on Budgets of the Council, the main bodies audited by the Commission and the European Agencies, as well as the EU-ORKB Presidents and EU-ORKB Presidents to evaluate our reports.
As in previous years, the vast majority of respondents have assessed that our reports in 2017 are accurate and that our reports are very accurate.
Expert reviews Every year independent external experts review the content and presentation of the sample of our reports in order to assess their quality.
In 2017, the auditors assessed six special reports* and the 2016 annual reports.
Assessment of the quality of the various aspects of the reports on a four-stage scale has a significant impact on the quality of the reports from (1) to the quality of the reports on the four-stage scale and on the quality of the results of the results and results of the results of the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the results and the results of the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation and the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the results and the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the results and results of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results and the results of the evaluation of the results and results of the results of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results and the results of the results of the results of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation and the results of the evaluation of the results of the results and the results of the results of the results of the evaluation of the results of the results of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results on the results in in on the evaluation of the results of the results of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of on the evaluation of the evaluation of the results of the results in in in in in the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results of the results on the evaluation of the on the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results in in in the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the results in in in the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the in in the in in the in in the evaluation of the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the in in in in the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the on the results of the in the on the evaluation of the on on on on on on the evaluation of the evaluation of the on the evaluation of the on on on the evaluation of the results of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the on on the evaluation of the results of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the evaluation of the

By the end of 2017, this was the case in 92% of the 2014 recommendations.

In 2017, 65% of the references to special reports in the online media concerning our work and our institution.
Overall, the number of media reports from our special reports increased by 11% compared to 2016.
The Court's reports, which received the largest media echo in 2017, are the special reports on the Greek financial crisis, on the registration centres of migrants, on fisheries control, on greening and on networks in 2000.

While less than 1500 articles were published online in 2013, the figure increased to almost 7000 in 2017, the average number of articles in the special report increased from less than 30 in 2013 to almost 130 in 2017.
The biggest media echo has reached our special report on the Greek financial crisis, where more than 2000 online articles and contributions on social media use resources on social media As part of our performance measurements, we also assess our resources, in particular our ability to carry out audits on time, to implement our work programme and to provide the expertise of our employees.
The audit period In 2017, an average of 14.6 months passed from the beginning of the audit task to the adoption of the special report.
This is the shortest processing time since the beginning of the period 2013-2017.
Eight reports (29%) published during the year took less than 13 months.
It took an average of 16 months to publish the reports and about two months less than in 2016.
This positive trend shows that the efforts to achieve the 13-month objective set out in the Financial Regulation are effective.

Our management 33 Publication of reports In 2017, 65 percent of our special reports were published according to the original plan.
The other reports were postponed and published in 2018.
In addition, our annual reports and all special annual reports have been published as planned.
Vocational training As recommended by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) we try to provide each auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of vocational training per year.
In 2017, we again exceeded this goal, reaching 6.7 days of training for one controller.
If the language courses necessary for the effective work of our auditors in all EU Member States are also taken into account, the controller represented an average of 8.3 days of training in 2017.
For other employees, we have set the goal of providing an average of 16 hours (two days) of vocational training (without language courses).
In 2017, this target was reached on an average of 2.3 days of training.

Our staff 34 Personnel allocations In 2017, we completed a staff reduction of 5 percent over a five-year period (2013-2017), in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2013 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management.
At the end of 2017, 853 officials and temporary staff worked at the Court. 548 of them worked at the control chambers, including 118 staff in the members' office.
The employment of the Court's staff has a broad academic and professional background.
Our employment policy is consistent with the general principles and conditions of employment of the EU institutions and promotes equal opportunities at all levels.
The staff shall include both officials and temporary staff.
General selection procedures are usually organised by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In 2017, the Court employed 72 persons: 29 officials, 13 temporary staff, 24 contract staff (of which seven left the Court by the end of the year) and six seconded national experts.
In addition, we have provided 71 graduates with traineeships for a period of between three and five months.

Our employees 35 Age profile Age profile of active workers on 31 December 2017 indicates that almost half of our employees are 44 years old or younger.
31 of the 68 directors and directors of the Court (46%) are 55 years of age or older.
As a result, in the next five to ten years, when these workers retire, a renewal will take place in higher management positions.
Balance between men and women The Court pursues a policy of equal opportunities which refers to all stages of the career of its employees.
Overall, we have achieved a balanced participation of men and women among our employees; 43% of our auditors and boards are women.
In recent years, we have managed to increase the participation of women in management positions in our examination chambers from 7% in 2015 to almost 20% in 2017.
We continue to advocate a balance between men and women at all levels of governance.
Our policy of equal opportunities for the years 2018-2020 also addresses issues related to age and disability.
For more information on the citizenship and gender of the executives, see the table below.

In 2017, we continued to develop our training offer, including increasing the number of courses in the field of e-learning and integrated learning (Blended Learning).
We continued our successful series of presentations organised by internal or external experts on changes in the audit and other issues related to the work of our auditors.
We also organised a series of trainings and events, during which experts from other supreme control bodies presented knowledge and best practices in the field of economic control and accounting control.
A good example of this is the Annual Training Day (Training Days), which we organized in November 2017 in cooperation with the University of Luxembourg and in which more than 300 employees participated.
We work closely with the European Commission, the European Institute for Public Administration (EIPA) and the European School of Administration (EUA) to offer our employees a wide range of training courses, including specific training in the field of audit and training in the field of personal skills development, as well as language courses related to work.
In addition, we have helped our employees to acquire or maintain professional qualifications and professional qualifications in areas related to the role and work of the Court.
In particular, we continued to work with the University of Lorraine (Nancy, France), which offers postgraduate studies in the framework of the Master Management of Public Organisations (Master Management of Public Organisations), postgraduate studies in the framework of the Master Management of Public Organisations (Nancy, France), postgraduate studies in the framework of the Master Management of Public Organisations (Master Management of Public Organisations) and postgraduate studies in the framework of the Master Management of Public Organisations (Nancy, France).
We also signed a cooperation agreement with the European Institute of Higher Education in Florence, Italy.
In 2017, we established a partnership with the University of Pisa (Italy) and the Accounting Association (ACCA) to organise a summer course in financial control and public responsibility.
Last year we rewarded the best contribution awarded by the Court for 2016 for the research work in the field of public sector audit.
37 We continued our Performance Recognition Awards (Performance Recognition Awards) (Performance Recognition Awards).
The translation by the Directorate for Translation, Language Services and Publications of the Court has translated and translated over 211 000 pages.
We continued our efforts to improve translations and reduce the costs associated with them.
For example, all our translation teams are currently using a common work platform to increase productivity.
We are trying to increasingly involve our translators in our basic activities and create more synergies with our auditors.
In particular, in 2017, translators increasingly supported auditors in drawing up special reports and annual reports.
In addition, they provided linguistic support to our inspectors during 38 inspection visits.
Information Technologies Our IT Directorate plays a key role in our control processes by optimising information flow through modern and secure technologies.
In the field of document management, we have made further progress and have fully digitised the processes of production, reception and publication.
We have introduced a simplified tool to facilitate remote access to mobile devices.
In addition, we have updated the system (the installation of Windows 10 and SharePoint 2013).
In order to make even better use of interinstitutional synergies, we have introduced new systems for managing audits, missions and training, which are currently being used by other EU institutions.
Support for control activities 38 Buildings The Court currently has three buildings (including K1w, K2w and K3w) and leases office buildings for its data recovery centre in Luxembourg.
K1 The K1 building opened in 1988 has offices for up to 310 staff and conference rooms.
In the bullets there are parking lots, technical equipment, warehouses, library and main archive, while the entire top floor is used for technical installations.
Building K1 was modernised in 2008 in order to adapt it to national health, safety and environmental requirements.
Where possible, the technology in the K1 building has been adapted to achieve compatibility with the K2 and K3 buildings.
In this way, three buildings form one integrated technical unit.
K2 K2 building was opened in 2003.
The bullets include parking lots, technical equipment, warehouses and a fitness centre.
The entire top floor is used for technical installations.
Other missiles are used in offices for up to 241 staff in which there are conference rooms, conference room with translation cabins, video conference room, café and kitchen base.
The Court commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of establishing areas of work related to the operation and the modernisation of the technical installations K2.
The study concluded that the structure of the work areas could be improved and that certain technical installations should be modernised.
A detailed analysis of this project will be carried out in 2018 and work will begin in 2019.
As the Council and the European Parliament approved in March 2014, the Court will use the remaining funds in the framework of the K3 construction project completed a few years ago in order to finance this modernisation.

The project for safety at work In 2017, the project for the improvement of the safety of the Court and its staff was continued as planned.
The new security control centre, external accreditation centre and access control centre for employees and visitors will be launched in 2018.
Environmental management As an institution of the European Union, we consider it our duty to respect the principle of sound environmental management in all activities, and we are constantly trying to reduce the Court's environmental impact.
In 2017, we received a certificate of the environmental management and audit system.
Currently, we successfully operate an EMAS-compliant environmental management system and fully meet the certification requirements set out in ISO 14001:2015.
Our goal is to systematically reduce CO2 emissions.
In 2017, in the third year in a row, we analysed greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. our CO2 footprint).
The results of this study are available on our website (eca.europa.eu).
Liability 40 of the Court Financial information The Court is financed by the general budget of the European Union and its budget falls within the scope of administrative expenditure.
In 2017, the Court's budget was around 141 million euro.
This represents less than 0,1% of the total EU expenditure or around 1.5% of the total EU administrative expenditure.
The budget share for 2017 was 98%.

Court's liability 42 Risk management During the year, in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Regulation, we have checked the risk assessments prepared for each Directorate.
The results of these checks shall be taken into account in the annual declaration of the authorising officer by delegation in the annual activity report and shall be taken into account in the risk assessments of the following year.
If necessary, we have prepared action plans for ex ante and ex post controls.
In September 2017, following these inspections, we strengthened internal controls and financial procedures regarding travel and management costs of service vehicles.
Internal audit and external audit Internal audit department shall advise the Court on issues relating to risk management.
The Commission shall deliver opinions on the quality of internal management and control systems and shall report to the Internal Audit Committee of three members of the Court and to the external expert.
The Committee shall regularly monitor the progress made in the various tasks identified in the annual work programme of the Internal Audit Unit and shall ensure its independence.
In 2017, the services examined the implementation of the Court's 2013-2017 strategy, the operational structure of the Directorate-General for Services, as well as the management of licences and software products.
The Commission has also examined the implementation by the Court of the risk management policy and monitored the implementation of its recommendations to ensure that action plans are being shaped.
The internal auditor considers that the existing procedures for the management, risk management and internal control in 2017 provide in general sufficient assurance that the Court's objectives will be achieved.
Every year we report to Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal audit.
External audit Our financial statements are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same principles of transparency and accountability to the authorities it has carried out.
The auditor's report on the Court's annual accounts for the financial year 2016 was published on 31 October 2017.
The discharge, like the other EU institutions, is subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2017, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2015.
This means that our annual accounts were finally approved for 2015.
As every year, we have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our responsibility for audit and management, we have taken appropriate action, and we have informed the European Parliament of our follow-up.
The Court issued 43 opinions on the Court's annual accounts on the Court's annual accounts on the Court's annual accounts on the annual accounts of the Court of Auditors on 31 December 2016 and on the Court of Auditors' financial situation and financial situation, financial flows and changes in net assets in the year ending on that date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).

The European Court of Auditors 4 Court of Auditors The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the external auditor of the European Union.
It was established in 1977 and is one of the seven EU institutions.
The Court is based in Luxembourg and employs around 900 employees from all EU countries, which consist of auditors and employees in horizontal and administrative services.
The College of the Court shall be composed of one member of each EU Member State.
The Court's tasks are to verify that the EU ensures that its financial rules are properly applied, that its policies and programmes are in line with the objectives and that they ensure that financial resources are used optimally.
Through its audit activities, the Court contributes to improving the EU's financial management and to improving accountability and transparency.
The Court makes its observations and recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, national governments and national parliaments and the general public.
Preface of the President 5 Dear Reader, Dear Reader!
We are now focusing more on assessing the results of the EU's actions, on the clearer message of our statements to the Court's addressees, and on increasing the value of our work for our stakeholders.
In this activity report we present a review of our work in 2018, in which we have published the highest number of special reports, analyses and opinions so far.
In addition, you can find information about our employees, management and our finances.
Our reports ensure an impartial evaluation of the Union's policies and programmes and the quality of EU financial management in the European Union and beyond.
We are checking whether EU expenditure is in line with the rules and whether EU policies and programmes ensure the optimal use of resources.
We will be happy to work with the newly elected European Parliament and the new European Commission to further improve the EU's financial management and ensure that the EU achieves its results.
In this report, we express our determination to continue to adapt the organisation of the Court to "prepare us for the future" and to continue to prepare for the development of control in the public sector.
2018 at a glance 44 record number of publications submitted by EU legislators 43 European Parliament 44 Global Audit Leadership Forum Council organized In about 45 international activities, 834 employees from all Member States participated in opinions: 10, mainly on the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 Impact of our work: Limited opinion on payments 6 in publications: 35 Special reports 9 Analyzed publications record number of publications Most of our recommendations implemented High level of media coverage: +17 000 Article 4 new members of the Court 5. Members' terms are perceived by the addressees that our work is useful and effective in social media 11 million times.
Our 2018 strategy is the first year of our current strategy, which covers the period up to and including 2020.
Our strategic objectives for this three-year period are to increase the added value of the statement of assurance for the current EU financial management, to focus more on the aspects of the effectiveness of EU action, to increase transparency among our addressees.
We also agreed that our entire organisation would focus even more on our products.
To achieve our strategy, we agreed on an action plan on these objectives to continue to be a leader in the development of the public sector.
All these measures were in progress at the end of 2018.
At the same time, we have already commissioned an independent peer review procedure to implement our strategy. Technical evaluation is due to be completed at the end of 2019. For more information, see the section on the Court's liability.
Progress towards achieving our strategic objectives 7
In the spotlight Among our products, the communication activities in sending clear statements to our addressees Communication is crucial to achieve our strategic goal of sending clear statements to our addressees, including to the political bodies of the EU and the Member States responsible for the control and management of Union policies and programmes, to the other highest control bodies, to businesses and industrial organisations, to researchers and, in particular, to the general public, to our key stakeholders.
In 2018, we saw how much the media are interested in our work.
In particular, our special reports have received great media interest and have increasingly been discussed in national and EU media channels.For more information, see the section on media presence.
In 2018, we published 12 audit forecasts (formerly called "basic documents") which are intended to serve as a source of information for those who are interested in specific policy areas or programmes for which controls are carried out.
The information provided therein shall be based on preparatory work prior to the commencement of the ongoing examination task.
The audit projections contributed to the stable and sustainable results of the Court's publication throughout the year: 2018 was the first year in which there was not a single month without the publication of the European Court of Auditors.
We will continue to publish this type of communication products in 2019. 8
Journal While our findings and recommendations on improving the EU's financial management are presented in our audit reports, in the Court's journal we pay particular attention to our working methods and our staff, who report in various areas.
Now every number is devoted to a different number of topics.
In 2018, the Court's report raised a number of issues such as EU assistance, Parliament's funding and control, and the EU's financial and economic governance, as well as our special reports, the work programme, international cooperation and our work for the future, aimed at "arming the Court for the future."

Audits More focus on results We carry out different types of controls in different areas of the EU budget: on Performance Audits in this area take into account the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EU policies and programmes, focusing on specific issues of governance or budget.
When selecting and organising these audit tasks, the Court shall take into account the risks related to cost-effectiveness or compliance, the level of revenue or expenditure, as well as the political and public interest; the audits and audits of compliance, as well as the reliability of the annual accounts, the legality and regularity of the basic financial operations, in particular in relation to the statement of assurance of expenditure, and the assessment of whether the systems in each budgetary area are in compliance with the rules.
Our random random procedure guarantees the same probability of checking for each euro issued.
Our audits focus on issues that reflect important issues for the EU, such as the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources, economic growth and social inclusion, the challenges of migration and global development, the internal market and the banking union, as well as ensuring the accountability and cost-effectiveness of the European Union.
On the basis of the evidence gathered during our audit work, our reports draw clear conclusions on the extent to which EU policy objectives have been achieved, as well as the state of budgetary and financial management of the Union.
Our research is in line with the international rules of public sector control.
The examination work consists of the following stages: 10

Planning of work Audit priorities are based on key EU issues Our work programme is adopted annually by the members of the Court.
In January 2018, President Lehne presented the 2018 work programme of the Conference of Commission Chairs of the European Parliament and asked all Parliament committees to propose potential topics for monitoring the 2019 work programme in the framework of the annual stakeholder consultation.
12 In October 2018, we published the first work programme prepared in line with the new strategy. In this 2019 work programme we presented our audit priorities and 36 analytical reports and products to be published this year.
These tasks included at least 29 out of 69 requests submitted by Parliament (42%) (2017: 32%).
In our assessments, we will continue to address key issues such as the sustainable use of natural resources, economic growth and social inclusion, migration, security and global development, the internal market and the accountability and cost-effectiveness of the EU to determine whether the EU is achieving what it has promised.
On-the-spot checks 3 761 days of audit work within and outside the EU Most of our examination work is carried out on the premises of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
At the same time, our auditors carry out numerous visits to the European Commission to the main body controlled by the Court, including the other EU institutions, agencies and bodies and EU delegations, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States and international organisations to which EU funds are coming in.
In addition, we carry out on-the-spot checks on beneficiaries of EU funds both within and outside the European Union.
With these checks, we can understand the audit trail and obtain direct audit evidence from the bodies involved in the management of the Union's policies and programmes, as well as the collection or payment of EU funds, as well as from the relevant beneficiaries13.
The frequency and intensity of our control activities in the individual Member States and beneficiary countries depends on the type of controls we have carried out.
In 2018, our auditors spent 3,761 days (2017: 3,670 days) on on-the-spot checks in the Member States and outside the EU.
In the EU, our on-the-spot checks are often carried out in conjunction with the highest control authorities in the Member States visited.
In addition, our auditors spent 2,723 days (2017: 2,300 days) in the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as in decentralised agencies and agencies across the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations, OECD and audit firms.
In order to obtain and approve control evidence, we are increasingly using video conferencing and other information technologies, such as secure data exchange and documents 14.

Combating fraud from the EU budget Nine alleged frauds In the fight against fraud from the EU budget, we work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
OLAF shall then decide on a possible investigation and shall cooperate with the authorities of the Member States if necessary.
Although our controls are not specifically designed to detect fraud, we sometimes encounter cases where we suspect irregularities or fraud.
In 2018, we handed over nine such cases to OLAF (2017: 13 cases) where fraud was suspected.
Further information on the nature of the suspected fraud provided to OLAF and the related recovery of funds, as recommended by OLAF, is provided in our annual reports on the EU general budget 16.
Publications New Record: the highest number of publications in 2018 Our audit reports, analyses and opinions are an important part of the EU's liability chain.
They help the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to monitor and verify that the EU achieves its political objectives and that the bodies responsible for EU financial management, in particular in the framework of the annual discharge procedure, are responsible.
This is primarily about the European Commission, but also about the other EU institutions and bodies.
National, regional and local authorities in the Member States also play an important role in the areas of shared management, in which most of the EU budget is spent, including in the areas of agriculture and cohesion.

Special reports Evaluation of the results of EU action in our Special Reports In line with the 2018-2020 strategy, we are increasingly focusing on assessing the results of EU action in order to ensure the optimal use of EU funds by EU citizens.
In 2018, we published 35 special reports (2017: 28 special reports) on the various areas of EU spending in which we discussed the challenges facing the EU, such as air pollution, the high-speed rail network, the refugee instrument in Turkey, banking supervision and funding of non-governmental organisations (NROs).
In the Special Reports, we examine whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved effectively and economically, and whether added value has been created within EU funds, i.e. whether more has been achieved than just through action at national level.
In addition, we make recommendations on financial savings, better working methods, prevention of waste or more cost-effective achievement of the policy objectives.
Here we will discuss two of our 2018 special reports: a special report on high-speed railways in the EU and a special report on the refugee instrument in Turkey.
In accordance with the EU Financial Regulation, we are trying to prepare our special reports within 13 months 20.

Special report on the European high-speed rail network: not reality, but the ineffective high-speed rail carpet brings many benefits to passengers.
It is a convenient, safe, flexible and ecological means of transport.
By improving the links between the EU regions, they become more competitive and contribute to European integration by bringing people closer together.
In this way we analyzed various connections, driving times and prices for business and private travellers.
We also examined whether co-financed investments in high-speed lines were cost-effective, effective, well-thought-out and planned.
The Court found that the European high-speed rail network is only an inefficient, inefficient combination of national lines that are not interlinked.
There is no realistic long-term plan to connect different parts of the existing EU network; fast connections that cross national borders do not belong to the priorities of the individual Member States and the European Commission does not have the power to force the Member States to do so.
In these circumstances, EU co-financing for high-speed railways brings little added value.
However, there is also good news: the number of high-speed passengers in Europe is increasing steadily, and in 1990 the number increased from around 15 billion passengers to more than 124 billion in 2016.
Both institutions welcomed the report and agreed with our proposals.
We also presented it to numerous national authorities and national supervisory authorities, researchers, industry stakeholders and media.
The EU-wide media, in particular EU-oriented media and financial media, have fully addressed this report, in particular in Spain and Germany.

Special Report Special Report The Instrument for Refugees in Turkey: although helpful, the optimal use of the funds can only be achieved through improvement, Turkey, in which almost 4 million people are coming, has adopted as many refugees as no other country in the world.
About 3.5 million of these refugees are Syrians, most of whom live outside refugee camps.
The support provided by the EU and its Member States under the Refugee Instrument in Turkey for a total amount of EUR 6 billion covers humanitarian actions and not humanitarian actions in favour of refugees and host communities.
Under the political agreement, Turkey was obliged to stop irregular migration from Turkey to the EU.
Humanitarian projects have helped to meet the basic needs of refugees, but in some cases the expected optimal use of the funds and the objective of the instrument of effective coordination of this support has not been achieved.
The humanitarian projects audited provided assistance to refugees.
For example, the emergency social security network helped 1.3 million refugees by cash aid.
However, for half of the projects, the expected impacts are still positive, which can be maintained without further financial support, and nine out of ten projects had to be extended.
Early implementation of projects managed by NGOs was mainly hindered by difficult working conditions.
This was the result of the Turkish authorities refusing to grant the data to eligible beneficiaries of two cash aid projects in our sample of a total of EUR 1.1 billion of EUR 1.1 billion.
We presented our report at a joint meeting attended by the Committee on Development, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, and then the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
It was also presented to the Enlargement Group and the acceding countries and the press.
In particular, in Germany, this report has met with great media interest, but also in Denmark, Austria, the Benelux countries and the Mediterranean countries, as well as in the EU-oriented media.

Annual Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2017 Annual Financial Report for the financial year 2017 Annual Financial Report for the financial year 2017, full opinion on revenue control, limited opinion on expenditure control Every year we check the revenue and expenditure from the EU budget and check that the annual accounts are reliable and that the revenue and expenditure transactions comply with the financial rules of the EU and the Member States.
In addition, we assess all the main areas of the EU budget in a specific way, based on the headings of the MFF 2014-2020, based on information on budgetary and financial management and results.
We also analyse why errors have occurred, make recommendations for possible improvements and assess whether and to what extent our previous recommendations have been implemented.
As part of our last annual report on the EU budget for the financial year 2017, our auditors have examined a sample of around 700 payments worth a total of EUR 100 billion to beneficiaries in various areas of EU budget expenditure.
This means that we have analysed about 700 different cases where EU funds have been used to support key infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in EU Member States, or to support non-EU beneficiaries.

The downward trend in the estimated error rate remains in the scope of this broad work, which is the basis for our statement of assurance, which we must present to the European Parliament and the Council, in accordance with our mandate set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The Court delivered an opinion on the reliability of the EU accounts and revenues, as in previous years.
In addition, in the second year in a row, we were able to deliver an opinion on EU expenditure to a limited (and not disappointed) extent.
A significant proportion of the expenditure audited in 2017 did not show a significant error rate.
In addition, the estimated error rate in payments in 2017 was 2,4% after the error rate in 2016 was 3,1 % and 3,8% in 2015.
The launch of the discharge procedure by Parliament The publication of our annual report takes place at the beginning of the discharge procedure by the European Parliament, in which, on the recommendation of the Council, the legislative authority and the EU budgetary authority in the EU, decides whether the management of the EU budget by the Commission and other bodies takes place satisfactorily.
On 4 October, we presented our annual report to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, at the same time as its publication, and then to the plenary assemblies of the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, as well as to the national Parliaments and bodies of the 14 Member States.
Mr Lehne, President of the European Court of Auditors and Mr Lazarou, President of the Court of Auditors, during the presentation of our annual report at the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg in November 2018 28
As regards cohesion expenditure, we have assessed the control and reliability framework for 2014-2020 and the reliability of the information submitted by the Commission in order to demonstrate regularity.
This was the first step towards the possible development of a statement of assurance as a test-based test.
With the revised approach and the transition to a test-based audit, we generally intend to take more account of the different internal controls in the European Commission and in the authorities of the Member States responsible for managing EU expenditure.
It is therefore more clear where shortcomings persist both within the European Commission and in the Member States, which allows us to increase accountability and further improve the EU's financial management.
This approach shall apply only if the relevant conditions laid down in the international audit rules are met. 29
Annual report on the European Development Funds Audit Report on payments under the European Development Fund (EDF) The European Union shall support development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and with overseas countries and territories.
The EDF shall be financed by the Member States of the Union and managed by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank outside the EU budget.
The main data on our audit opinions on the EDF are presented below.
Special Annual Reports Agencies and other bodies The unlimited audit opinion for all EU agencies, with the exception of one EU agency, is based across Europe and employs around 11 000 employees.
The budget of all agencies for 2017, with the exception of the Single Committee for Restructuring and Structured Restructuring, amounted to EUR 3.5 billion, representing around 2.7% of the total EU budget.
The 2017 SRB budget financed by the contributions of credit institutions amounted to EUR 6.6 billion.
European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London, which is moving to Amsterdam New approach: one report on all 41 EU agencies In 2018, we decided to present the results of our audit in EU agencies in a more user-friendly format.
While we continued to present individual statements of assurance for each agency, we published one annual report on all agencies, including a summary document entitled "Consumer information on the audit of EU agencies."
As every year, we also publish our annual reports on European Schools and conditional commitments to the SRB, the Commission and the Council 31.
Following the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, the Council decided to transfer EMA and EBA to Amsterdam and Paris in 2019.
Joint Undertakings Unlimited evaluation of all European Joint Research Undertakings other than the Joint Undertaking is an EU public-private partnership with industry, research groups and Member States, which play an important role in the implementation of certain aspects of EU research policy.
The European Commission is a member of the public sector joint venture and represents the EU.
Private members include various partners in the industrial and research sectors.
One of the main objectives of the Joint Undertaking is to collect contributions from private sector members and research, which is their added value.
33 Main conclusions Overall, our evaluation of the Agency for the year ending 31 December 2017 confirmed the positive results of previous years.
About We issued unreserved opinions on the reliability of the accounts for all agencies; on opinions on the legality and regularity of the revenues of all agencies; on opinions on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts of all agencies; on opinions on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts of all agencies, except for the failed opinion on the European Asylum Support Office, which identified a number of problems.
The main requests for confirmation and confirmation of the accounts of all EU Joint Undertakings for the financial year 2017. on the Seven Joint Undertakings received full audit opinions on their income and payment transactions; the Joint Undertaking on electronic components and systems for the leading role of Europe received a limited opinion on the audit, as the auditors identified problems which, in some cases, affected effective internal control.
Opinions also contribute to improving the EU's financial management by publishing opinions on the Commission's proposals for new or revised legislation.
In the case of acts having a significant financial impact, the Court's opinions are required under EU law.
They are primarily used by the legislative body of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Opinions may also be initiated at the request of other institutions or at the Court's own initiative.
In 2018, we issued ten opinions in various areas of governance in the EU.
Firstly, they concerned mainly the Commission's legislative proposals for the new multiannual financial framework, such as the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and its cooperation with the future European Public Prosecutor's Office (the European Public Prosecutor's Office) and the link between EU funding and compliance with the rule of law and the protection of marginalised persons.
The CAP reform opinion calls for a greener and more coherent CAP that takes more account of accountability When the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a new CAP after 2020, it stressed that environmental and climate objectives would be given priority.
However, in our opinion on CAP reform, we have pointed out that many proposed policy options differ slightly from the current CAP system.
In particular, most of the budget will continue to be direct payments to farmers based on the number of hectares used or used.
We have also noted that this instrument is not the most cost-effective way of supporting adequate income and is therefore not taking many environmental aspects into account.
Furthermore, the Commission's assessment of the CAP's contribution to the EU's climate change objectives seems unrealistic, and the Court therefore recommends greener and more coherent, results-based plans for the next CAP, which should focus more on accountability. 34
In accordance with the procedure that we are applying in our reports, this opinion has been presented to the committees of the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council, environmental and agricultural stakeholders and the press 35.
Analysis-based publications: Landscape analysis, Rapid Case Reviews A comprehensive analysis of publicly available information and own work of the Court of Landscape Landscape Analysis In 2018, we prepared two Landscape analyses.
In the first instance, the Court examined the application of Union law in practice and concluded that the Commission's supervisory activities in the application of Union law by the Member States should be strengthened.
In the second analysis of the Landscape programme, we have dealt with mobility and transport, and we have recognised them as the basis for European integration.
However, we have been concerned about the delays in investment, as the reduction in investment in transport infrastructure slows down the modernisation of the transport network in the EU.
Thematic documents A total of six thematic documents were published in 2018: five on the Commission proposals on the future MFF and one on the integration of migrants in the EU.
The Court's observations on the multiannual financial framework focused in particular on the proposed procedure for setting priorities for EU expenditure, the flexibility of the EU budget, the focus on the results and simplification of governance, as well as on the principles of accountability and control.
We welcomed the Commission's efforts to modernise the EU budget for the period after 2020, but at the same time showed a number of potential threats, identified a number of shortcomings and proposed concrete improvements.
We stressed the need for effective parliamentary control, fair accountability, and that the Court should, in principle, be designated as an external auditor for all bodies set up by the EU.
Rapid Case Reviews As part of the only rapid analysis submitted in 2018 on cohesion, we have discovered that the VAT refund is wrong and is not always the optimal use of EU funds.
We felt that the return of VAT to public authorities should no longer be possible in the case of expenditure co-financed by the EU in the post-2020 period 36.
Conference on Financial Instruments In January 2018, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Lithuania, we organised a joint high-level conference on EU financial instruments in Vilnius.
This event enabled high-level experts from EU institutions and Lithuanian institutions, experts and other public and private stakeholders to exchange views and ideas.
Symposium on public funding for parliaments In March 2018, the Court organised a two-day international symposium on public funding for European Parliaments, the aim of which was to discuss their autonomy and to analyse the budgetary systems of the EU Member States.
Global Audit Leadership Forum Leadership In April 2018, we hosted the 5th Global Audit Leadership Forum, where presidents and representatives of about twenty of the highest control bodies from around the world met.
This process mainly discussed the practice and limitations of performance control in the political context, as well as the challenges and opportunities for the transmission of control reports in the digital age37.
38 The fifth meeting of the Global Audit Forum of the Leadership Forum in April 2018, during which we took part in the European Court of Auditors in May 2018, in which we took part in the European Day events in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg.
At the information stations, our auditors could get information about our role and work and firsthand how the controls were carried out.
We will continue to organise open days at the European Court of Auditors and participate in public events in order to make contact with citizens.
Symposium on Good Public Administration In September 2018, we took part in a symposium on UN sustainability and public governance entitled "Good Public Administration and Benefits for Citizens" on "The Role of Parliamentary Control Bodies" organised by the Austrian Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of INTOSAI and the Austrian Public Prosecutor.
The conference on the application of Union law In September 2018, we organised a conference on the application of Union law, during which the need for accountability, transparency and audit was discussed, and then as part of our analysis on the application of Union law in practice.
This event took place at the Committee of the Regions building in Brussels.
Conference on e-commerce and related taxation In October 2018, we organised a conference on e-commerce and tax challenges in the digital age.
Speakers and panel participants discussed the risks associated with the current VAT model in e-commerce and proposed alternative tax models to use modern technologies such as Blockchain.
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority Conference (EIOPA) In November 2018, we took part in the eighth annual EIOPA conference in Frankfurt.
Over 400 people from the financial services, science, consumer organisations, media, international organisations, EU institutions and national authorities met during the conference.
The Court presented its audit work on supervision and financial stability in the European insurance sector in 2018 on the specific report on EIOPA in 2018.
COP24 In December 2018, we took part in the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice.
We presented our audit work on air quality and its impact on climate change and vice versa and discussed the challenges of desertification and desertification in the EU in 2018 both topics were discussed in the special reports published by us in 2018.
Janusz Wojciechowski, a member of the Court, presented the School Project Day in Katowice in December 2018 in Katowice, the School Project Day organised by the EU institutions by the Court's employees throughout the year.
17 of our employees visited secondary schools in seven Member States and informed students about the EU, the role of our institution and the opportunities to study in the EU and work in EU institutions 40.
Relations with institutional addressees The impact of our work depends on the benefits of our work our institutional addressees We work closely with the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and national parliaments, because the impact of our work depends to a large extent on the benefits of our audit results and recommendations.
The European Parliament The number of reports discussed in parliamentary committees is a record Members of the Court and teams of auditors are regularly invited to submit to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to other committees of the European Parliament and other bodies their findings and recommendations.
In 2018, we presented to Parliament 33 special reports, four opinions and six studies-based publications.
In total, we took part in 74 meetings with the Committee on Budgetary Control (2017: 60) and 38 meetings with 13 other committees and working groups of Parliament and with political groups in Parliament.
A joint annual meeting of the Court's representatives with the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control was held in February 2018.
In April 2018, President Lehne took part in the debate at the plenary session of the European Parliament on the 2016 discharge procedure.
In October 2018, he presented the Court's annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control of Parliament and the Assembly for the financial year 2017.
In addition, 44 presentations were adopted in 2017 for other competent Council preparatory bodies (in 2017: 27).
During the year, we presented 37 special reports, four opinions and three studies-based publications to the Council (2017: 27).
During the Bulgarian Presidency, during January 2018, President Lehne met with the Deputy Minister of Finance in Bulgaria to discuss important arrangements for the 2016 discharge procedure.
In March 2018, President Lehne and Mr Neven Mates, member of the Court responsible for our special report on macroeconomic imbalances, presented the report to the EU Finance Ministers at the ECOFIN Council meeting.

Measuring Results Our new key performance indicators within the 2018-2020 strategy We have been using key performance indicators (KPIs) since 2008 to inform the management of the progress of our objectives, to support the decision-making process and to inform the addressees of our achievements.
We have not only adopted our strategy for the years 2018-2020, but have also adapted our KPI for this period.
Therefore, 2018 is the first year in which we can report on these indicators.
These five KPIs provide a comprehensive overview of the organisation of our work in the field of dissemination, impact and perception. about KPI 1 implementation of our recommendations (implementation of the recommendations of the Court) about KPI 2 in the field of organisation of our work (in the field of our work) feedback on our work (in relation to the reception of interested parties to the work of the Court) about KPI 3 in the field of our perceptions in the European Parliament, the Council and the national parliaments (in so far as the Court is in the European Parliament, the Council and national parliaments) about KPI 4 in the field of special respondents (and similar products) published (number of special reports (and similar products) about KPI 5 in the field of press in the Court's presence) 50
51 Number of special reports and similar products in 2018 We monitor the number and timeliness of reports published throughout the year.
It gives a clue to the accuracy of our planning.
Out of the 47 reports planned for 2018, 44 special reports were published: 35 special reports, six thematic documents, two Landscape analyses and a quick analysis.
In addition to the selected controls provided for in our work programme, we have issued ten opinions.
Special reports and similar products 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 44 30 2017 2018 Our speeches in the European Parliament, in the Council of the EU and in national Parliaments Most of our audit reports are presented to the competent committee of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
In addition, the majority of the members of the Court present our annual reports to the national Parliament of the Member State concerned.
In 2018, the Court spoke 133 times to the European Parliament (2017: 91), 65 times to the Council (2017: 47) and 50 times to the national parliaments (2017: 19).
This is a significant increase compared to 2017.
The Court's statement in 2018: European Parliament, Council and national Parliaments 52 European Parliament 91 Council of the EU 47 133 65 50 National Parliaments 19 2017 2018 The number of online articles and articles in social media almost three times Since 2018 we have been in close contact with media and non-institutional actors and we are much more active in social media.
76 press releases were published in 23 EU languages (2017: 57) and 20 press lists in Brussels (2017: 16), including press lists for the annual report, including press lists for individual sectors and for individual Member States.
We have also received journalists from Brussels and Member States and have offered several meetings with stakeholders from the sector, NGOs and the filling sector for selected reports.
53 Visits of journalists from Member States in Luxembourg in November 2018 We follow the media in our work and our institution, which may vary considerably depending on the subject and complexity of the report.
At the same time, we must remember that external factors can have a major impact on media interest in our publications.
For example, if the publication date coincides with an important event or policy development, the public interest in this matter may increase significantly.
The total number of media reports, including social media, has almost tripled: in 2017 there were around 15,500 articles and online articles in social media, and in 2018 their number has increased to over 44 000.
In 2018, almost 18 times more frequently than in 2017, in social media, which were published by the Court's official accounts in connection with our publications.
Special reports on reporting in the media are our excellent product in the field of communication and reporting in the media, which is why special reports have become our model product. Twelve of the Court's fifteen most successful publications in 2018 are special reports.
This year there were over 11 000 online articles on our special reports, which means that this number has more than doubled compared to 2017.
In 2013, the total number of articles on the Internet was 1500... in the year in which we started to follow the media.
In comparison to 2017, an increase of 60% in the average number of media reports in the special report was noted at the same time.
This means that our presence in the media has increased not only because of more reports but also because of our increased interest in our publications.

Effects and perception of our work Our reports are effective and effective We are assessing the impact and perception of our work on the basis of the assessments carried out by the addressees. Another criterion of the evaluation is further action on the basis of our recommendations on improving the EU's financial management.
At the beginning of 2018, we started to call on stakeholders (the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, EU agencies, permanent representations of Member States, public authorities of Member States, national supervisory authorities, non-governmental organisations, science, media, etc.) to provide feedback on the adequacy and likely impact of our reports.
The feedback shall relate to selected special reports and analyses and to the Court's annual reports and shall be collected by anonymous electronic surveys from all who have previously received a copy of those reports.
This study will also allow stakeholders to provide qualitative feedback on reports and provide general proposals on the Court's work.
In total 87% of respondents confirmed the usefulness of our reports for their work and 78% confirmed their effectiveness.

Monitoring our recommendations Most of our recommendations have been implemented since 2018 instead of the European Commission's management declaration we use as the basis for this indicator of action taken by our controllers.
In 2018, we examined the recommendations made in our special reports published in 2014 and in our annual report of the same year.
This analysis shows that 74% of the recommendations made by us in our 2014 Annual Report and 94% of the recommendations made in our 2014 Special Reports have been fully, largely or partially implemented.

Support for control activities Vocational training Vocational training: In this way we equip our employees and the Court for the future In line with the recommendations issued by the International Accounting Federation (IFAC), we try to provide each auditor with an average of 40 hours (five days) of professional training per year.
In 2018, we again exceeded this goal, reaching 6.9 days of training for one controller.
We continued to expand the scope of the training that we offer to employees both in the area of control and beyond, and we supported controllers in obtaining different certificates.
We continued our successful series of presentations organised by internal or external experts on the development of audit or other issues related to the work of our auditors.
We continued the Performance Recognition Awards programme, which allows employees who do not hold management positions to participate in specialized external trainings.

Internal audit and external audit Internal audit body shall advise the Court on risk management issues.
It provides independent and objective guarantees and advice to increase and improve the added value of the Court's activities.
In addition, they shall report to the Internal Audit Committee, consisting of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee shall regularly monitor the progress made in the implementation of the various tasks set out in the annual work programme of the internal audit body and shall ensure its independence.
In 2018, she carried out a review of the Court's cyber security systems and the construction work related to its protection.
These services have also examined the implementation by the Court of the risk management policy and the annual declarations by the authorising officer by delegation.
The Commission has also monitored the implementation of its previous recommendations to ensure that the agreed action plans are being shaped.
In 2018, the audits carried out by the services did not reveal any shortcomings which, due to their nature or scope, could seriously undermine the overall credibility of the internal control systems which were introduced by the authorising officer by delegation to ensure the legality and regularity of the Court's financial operations.
Every year we report to the European Parliament and the Council on the results of the internal audit.
External audit Our financial statements are audited by an independent auditor.
This is an important aspect of the Court's approach to applying the same principles of transparency and accountability as those of the authorities it has carried out.
The auditor's report on the Court's annual accounts for the financial year 2017 was published on 17 May 2018 on 17 May 2018. 70
The Court's audit report of 2017 71 The Court's financial statements: "After our assessment, the annual financial report shall provide a true and fair view of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors (the "Hofem') as at 31 December 2017 and the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in net assets for the year ending that date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).
Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).'
Regarding the use of resources and the Court's audit procedure: "In the framework of our actions described in this report, we have not found ourselves in a situation in which we would have to state that, in all relevant matters and in the light of the above evaluation criteria, the resources allocated to the Court have not been used for the intended purposes and that the audit procedures established do not ensure that the financial transactions have been carried out in accordance with the rules and regulations in force."
The discharge, like the other EU institutions, is subject to the discharge procedure.
In April 2018, the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2016.
As every year, we have carefully analysed the problems raised during the discharge procedure with regard to our responsibility for audit and management, we have taken the appropriate steps, and we have discussed in detail our follow-up to the European Parliament.
On 26 March 2019 the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge for the financial year 2017.
This means that our annual accounts were finally approved for 2017.
The peer reviews shall be subject to an independent and transparent assessment of the competence of the OPEC concerned by other OPECs.
Each interested party involved in the peer review shall continue to respect the independence of the other parties involved in the peer review in the course of the implementation.
In 2018, we asked ORB Estonia (chairman of the ORB), Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States of America to assess whether the Court is in a position to achieve its strategic objectives in the mid-term of 2018-2020 and whether the measures taken so far to implement the strategy will have the desired effect.
The peer review report is expected to be published at the beginning of 2019.
At the same time, together with the ORB of Poland and the United Kingdom, we started preparations for mutual verification of the ORB of Lithuania.
The main objective of this evaluation will be to assess whether the control approach adopted by the ORB in Lithuania is in line with international standards.
In addition, during the year, we commissioned an external and independent evaluation of the Court's ethical framework.
This peer review is carried out by the Court of Auditors of Croatia and Poland.
The audit report is expected to be made available in 2019 72
The statement by the authorising officer by delegation below the signed Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors hereby declares that the information contained in this report is correct and accurate and confirms with reasonable assurance that the appropriations made available for the activities described in this report have been used for the intended purposes and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management for which the established control procedures provide reasonable assurance of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and of the proper handling of allegations of fraud or suspected fraud of the costs and benefits of the control.

European Court of Auditors 5 Who we are about the European Union's external auditor; what was created in 1975 under the Treaty of Brussels; what we are about to do in October 1977; what we are about the Maastricht Treaty of 1993 is the EU institution; what we are about the EU's headquarters in Luxembourg; what is one member from each EU Member State, appointed by the Council after consulting the European Parliament; what is about 900 workers from all EU Member States.
Our role in ensuring that the EU ensures sound financial management, correctly applies its financial rules and achieves its objectives through its policies and programmes, and ensures that financial resources are used optimally.We warn against risks, ensure security of control, point to weaknesses and successes and give guidance to policy makers and EU legislators. to present our comments and recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council, the governments and national parliaments and the general public.
2019 was the year of many changes for the Union: the elections to the European Parliament took place and the new European Commission joined it.
The strategic priorities have been re-defined and important package measures have been launched, such as the European Green Agreement and the European Digital Future (early 2020).
At the end of the year it became clear that we would now be a Union of 27 Member States.
At the same time, the EU is at an important financial crossroads.
We are in the process of negotiating the next multiannual financial framework, the results of which will be crucial for the financial capacity of the Union over the next seven years.
All EU institutions must now build on their efforts to further improve EU financial management and ensure that the EU delivers results.
As an external auditor, we offer an impartial assessment of the Union's policies and programmes and the quality of the EU's financial management within and outside the Union.
We are checking whether EU expenditure is in line with the rules whether EU policies and programmes ensure the optimal use of resources.
This activity report provides an overview of our work in 2019 in which we have published a wide range of latest special reports, analyses and opinions.
You will also find information about our employees, management and finance.
We hope that this information will be useful.
We are publishing this year's activity report at a time when public health in the EU and in the Member States is facing an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our institution responded quickly to this situation in accordance with the Luxembourg Government's health and safety instructions.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their good work and their willingness to adapt flexibly to the current situation.
We must now act together and make every effort to continue to act as an external EU controller in these difficult times.

8 Our actions Strategy To continue public financial control, we rely on multi-annual strategies to take long-term decisions on our control work and to take initiatives on organisational changes to continuously improve.
At the end of 2019 we completed the second year of the current strategy for the years 2018-2020.
During this three-year period, we have defined the following strategic objectives: increasing the added value of the Statement of Assurance; increasing the focus on the aspects of the effectiveness of EU action; providing clear information for our addressees.
To achieve our strategy, we have agreed on an action plan that includes these objectives.
Over the last two years, we have made good progress towards achieving our strategic objectives.
A number of initiatives and projects have been launched for all of the areas identified, which sometimes go even beyond the scope of the Action Plan, in particular the pilot phase of the test-based audit approach in order to produce a statement of assurance, which has led to useful results; a significant increase in the number of audits and analytical products, as well as a wider range of issues, covering both EU expenditure and regulatory action; better contacts with the European Parliament, as well as greater visibility in traditional and social media.
During the year, a group of the four highest audit bodies (Estonia, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United States) carried out a peer review of our strategy.
The report of our colleagues was published in March 2020, just in time to support our next strategy, starting in 2021.
Good progress on the implementation of the strategy 9
Monitoring the efficiency and regularity of EU operations Performance control, accounting audits and compliance audits Our performance audits take into account the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EU policies and programmes.
It focuses on issues relevant to the EU, such as sustainable and environmentally sustainable use of natural resources, economic growth and social inclusion, migration and global development challenges, the internal market and the banking union, and ensuring the accountability and cost-effectiveness of the European Union.
These controls aim at helping the EU achieve its policy objectives better.
Our accounting checks and compliance checks lead to the assurance of the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
In addition, we can carry out selected conformity checks to examine or assess the Union's budgetary and financial management, whether the management and control systems established for the collection and use of EU funds comply with EU and national rules in force.
Our controls are in line with international public sector controls. 10
Work Programme Strategic perspectives In 2019 we continued to integrate the strategic perspective into our audit work to better address the major future challenges for the EU through a future-oriented approach.
To this end, we have set up an advisory committee on strategies and perspectives.
One of the Committee's ongoing tasks, consisting of five members, is to monitor the development of the post-2020 strategy.
The audit priorities for EU future issues Our work programme was published in October 2019 in which we present our audit priorities for the coming years and 41 reports and analyses to be published for 2020.
Our audits planned for 2020 and beyond will continue to provide EU citizens and policy makers with independent reports on issues relevant to the future of the EU.
We draw up a work programme for our exams in an independent way, but not in complete isolation from our surroundings.
It is therefore extremely important that we cooperate with our institutional stakeholders, especially the European Parliament.
As usual, at the beginning of 2019, all parliamentary committees asked to propose possible audit topics of our work programme. 11
On-site work Most of our examination work takes place in our rooms in Luxembourg.
Our auditors also carry out numerous visits to the European Commission to our main body verified at the same time as other EU institutions and EU agencies and bodies, national, regional and local authorities in the Member States, EU delegations in third countries and international organisations in receipt of EU funds.
In addition, we carry out on-the-spot checks in the EU and beyond with the beneficiaries of EU funds.
With these controls, we can understand the audit trail and obtain direct audit evidence from the bodies involved in the management of Union policies and programmes and in the collection or payment of EU funds and from the beneficiaries of such funds.
In line with the objective set out in the EU Financial Regulation, we are trying to complete the audits we have chosen within 13 months 12.
3 605 days of on-site verification work within and outside the EU Our examination teams usually consist of two to three examiners, and the duration of the verification visit may be several days, but may also be several weeks.
In the EU, our on-the-spot checks are generally coordinated with the highest audit authorities of the Member States concerned.
13 The frequency and intensity of our control activities in the individual Member States and beneficiary countries depends on the type of controls we have carried out.
In 2019 our auditors spent 3 605 days (2018: 3 671 days) on on-the-spot checks in the Member States and outside the EU.
In addition, our auditors spent 2504 days (2018: 2 723 days) in the EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg, as well as in decentralised agencies and agencies across the EU, international organisations such as the United Nations, OECD and audit firms.
In order to interact with our research units, we are increasingly using video conferencing and other information technologies, such as secure data and documents exchange. 14
Audit reports, analyses and opinions Our audit reports, analyses and opinions are an important link in the EU's accountability chain.
They assist the European Parliament and the Council in monitoring and verifying the achievement of the EU's policy objectives and in clearing the bodies responsible for EU financial management in particular in the framework of the annual discharge procedure.
Special reports and analysis products In line with our strategy for 2018-2020 in recent years, we have focused more on assessing the results of EU action.
In 2019 we published 36 special reports and analyses, which address many of the challenges facing the Union in various areas of EU spending, such as food security, renewable energy, e-commerce, border controls, budgetary management and the ethical framework in selected EU institutions, in order to mention only some of them 15.
16 In the special reports, we examine whether the objectives of selected EU policies and programmes have been achieved, whether the results have been achieved effectively and economically and whether the EU's actions bring added value, i.e. whether more has been achieved than the actions taken at national level.
In addition, we make recommendations on financial savings, better working methods, prevention of waste, or more effective achievement of the policy objectives.
Our analyses are often aimed at providing descriptions and analytical analyses from a cross-cutting perspective and on the basis of previous studies or other publicly available information.
They can also serve as a presentation of our analysis of areas or issues that have not yet been investigated or present facts on specific issues or problems.
Unlike exams, they do not deal with assessment issues, nor do they guarantee credibility.
17 Sustainable exploitation of natural resources Analysis 01/2019: EU response to the diesel scandal In 2015, differences were detected between the exhaust values of the test bench and the exhaust values of the road.
Studies have shown that so-called "cut-off devices" have been used that have resulted in lower emissions during official tests than during normal driving.
The type-approval authorities of certain Member States have responded to the exhaust scandal through the re-test of diesel engines.
These studies have shown that almost all light diesel vehicles of Euro 5 and Euro 6 have significantly exceeded the NOx limit values of road vehicles, in some cases by more than 10 times.
We have considered measures taken by both the EU and the Member States in response to the diesel scandal.
We also took into account the changes introduced after September 2015 in the exhaust emission measurement system.
We have noted that many legal changes in the EU type-approval and vehicle emission testing system have been adopted in an accelerated manner.
The Commission is currently empowered to verify the work of the national type-approval authorities and to carry out vehicle tests and to withdraw or suspend type-approval.
Interested third parties may now carry out emission tests.
The Commission has also opened infringement proceedings against certain Member States.
We have also noted that in several Member States there has been an increased readiness to reduce traffic in order to improve air quality, and in several European cities low-carbon zones have been created in which motor traffic is limited or prohibited.
We have presented the results of our work in the form of an analysis, because in the near future the legislative changes introduced will have no tangible impact.
Our analysis does not make recommendations.
18 Investment for Cohesion, Growth and Integration Special Report No 08/2019: Wind and solar energy for electricity generation: the achievement of the EU's objectives requires significant efforts in electricity generation from non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, non-renewable waste and nuclear fuels in conventional reactors, or renewable energy sources such as water, wind and solar energy, biomass, etc.
Renewable energy sources also serve the production of heat and cooling and fuel production for the transport sector.
Currently, 79% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions come from the use of fossil fuels for energy production.
Increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity production will contribute to the EU's greenhouse gas reduction target.
Member States shall determine how they make best use of their energy resources and how they organise their energy supplies.
The EU can support Member States' efforts through additional funds to invest in renewable energy projects.
We have assessed the progress made by the EU and the Member States in achieving the renewable energy target in order to achieve the EU's overall target of 20% by 2020 and 32% by 2030.
In Germany, Greece, Spain and Poland, we checked whether the support for wind and photovoltaic electricity generation was effective.
We have noted that there has been significant progress since 2005 in the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, but this trend has been slowed since 2014.
The share of renewable energy in electricity production in the EU increased from around 15% in 2015 to around 31% in 2017 and doubled.
Wind and solar energy are technologies that have contributed most to this growth.
However, achieving the objectives will be a major challenge for around half of the Member States.
We recommended that the Commission encourage Member States to promote further development by organising auctions for additional renewable energy capacities, promoting greater participation by citizens, simplifying administrative procedures and removing shortcomings in the networks.
In addition, we recommended that the Commission review the legal requirements for the Member States in order to improve the timeliness of statistical data.
19 External policy, security and justice Special Report No 24/2019: Asylum, relocation and return of migrants: time to step up efforts to eliminate disparities between objectives and results In 2015, the European Union experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, followed by an increase in the number of asylum applications.
In recent years, the number of immigrants has returned to pre-crisis levels.
We interviewed the staff of the European Commission, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (hereinafter Frontex).
Monitoring visits were carried out by national authorities, international organisations and non-governmental organisations implementing EU-funded projects, as well as 20 EU support actions in Greece and Italy.
Both Member States are particularly affected by these migration flows.
We assessed whether the objectives of EU-funded support had been achieved and the asylum and return procedures had been achieved effectively and quickly.
We also checked whether the objectives and objectives of the temporary emergency relocation system had been achieved.
We noticed that hotspots significantly improved the rates of registration and fingerprinting.
Nevertheless, many migrants continue to move to other EU Member States and apply for asylum without storing fingerprints in the Eurodac database.
In addition, asylum procedures continue to continue for a long time and a narrow throat in both Member States.
A large proportion of applicants were transferred to Italy (80% in Greece and 89% in Italy).
However, since February 2018, the Commission has not monitored the relocation process in host countries.
As in other EU countries, return rates from Greece and Italy are low.
We recommended that the next Commission take appropriate action to improve the management of emergency aid.
In addition, the Commission should take advantage of past experience in the development of future voluntary relocation mechanisms.
Finally, EASO's support for asylum procedures should be increased and Frontex's support for return operations should be adapted.
20 Market regulation and a competitive economy Special Report No 10/2019: EU-wide stress tests for banks: the need for as much information as possible on banks but greater coordination and risk concentration The aim of the EU-wide stress test for banks is to assess the possible impact that a joint shock can have on the financial situation and profitability of large European banks.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) shall be responsible for initiating and coordinating EU-wide stress tests on banks.
Stress tests have been carried out in the EU since 2011, all of which have been carried out on the basis of a bottom-up approach, with banks reporting the results of a shock scenario based on a methodology approved by EBA.
We assessed the implementation of the EU-wide stress test in the banking sector in the framework of the mandate granted to EBA.
We found that at the beginning of the procedure EBA did not specify either the risks or the weight they considered relevant to the stress test procedure.
The ESRB, which has developed a stress scenario, has, in turn, received significant contributions from the ECB and national central banks and public authorities.
As a result, EBA had no control over the relevant stages of the procedure.
In the United States, the supervisory authorities are based on a top-down approach, which gives them much more control over the performance of the banks.
On the other hand, EBA's role in the EU is limited to the launch of stress tests, the provision of methodology and coordination of stress tests to a broad extent.
The EBA stress test assessed the vulnerability of the system and banks to the economic downturn and not to the severe financial shocks affecting the system.
Although EBA has sought wide coverage, some risk-bearing banks have been excluded from the stress test.
The bottom-up approach of EBA has led to a limited credibility and comparability of the results of the banks.
We recommended that EBA strengthen control of the stress test and develop a top-down approach to complement the current bottom-up approach.
Furthermore, in order to achieve the objective of assessing resilience to adverse market developments, future stress tests should take due account of the risks of the EU financial system, ensure a minimum level of stress and provide clear information on the resilience of banks.
Finally, the choice of banks for stress tests should be made not only by size but also by risk.
21 EU funding and management Special Report No 14/2019: "Your opinion counts!"
The public consultation carried out by the Commission includes citizens, but the lack of information activities "better lawmaking" aims at ensuring an open and transparent policy decision-making process based on the best facts available and carried out by citizens and other stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and representative organisations, which are fully involved.
The Commission shall consult citizens and representative organisations in all areas of Union action.
The Better Regulation Guidelines define consultation of stakeholders, including citizens as "interested stakeholders."

The Commission has an average of over 100 public consultations per year.
We assessed whether the public consultation carried out by the Commission effectively contributed to reaching out to citizens and stakeholders and to making use of their contributions.
We have examined the structure of the Commission's framework, how the Commission has prepared and carried out the selection of the public consultation and how it has provided information on the consultation activities and how it has benefited from the consultation.
Between 2016 and 2018, we tested the sample of 26 public consultations carried out by the Commission by the five Directorates-General and carried out a public opinion poll to determine to what extent the public consultation participants were actually satisfied.
We have noted that the Commission's public consultation framework has a high standard.
Moreover, the overall public consultation attempt with the Commission showed a positive balance sheet and its perception by the participants was generally satisfactory.
The shortcomings were detected in information activities and information activities, for example, the whole range of communication channels was not always used, there were no clear criteria to justify why the questionnaire was not available in all the official languages of the EU and some questionnaires were long and complex.
We recommended that public consultation advertising be more targeted and targeted in order to increase visibility and to allow more people to participate in the consultation.
We also encouraged the Commission to report better on the follow-up to public consultation.
Finally, there is potential for improving citizens' participation in initiating legislative proposals under the European Citizens' Initiative.
Audit forecast Audit projections provide information on current audit tasks (in terms of economic audit).
They shall be based on preparatory work carried out prior to the start of the checks and shall serve as a source of information for those who are interested in specific policy areas and/or programmes which are subject to ongoing checks.
In 2019 we published 18 exam forecasts (2018: 12).
Annual reports and special annual reports The annual reports mainly contain the results of our statement of assurance of the budget of the European Union and the European Development Fund (EDF).
The special annual reports shall include the results of the annual audit of the annual accounts of the agencies, decentralised agencies and EU Joint Undertakings and European Schools.
In addition, we publish a report on conditional obligations arising from the implementation of the Single Committee on Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring 22.
Annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2018 Each year we review EU revenue and expenditure to verify that the annual accounts are reliable and that the revenue and expenditure transactions underlying them comply with the relevant EU and Member State legislation.
In addition, we present detailed evaluations on all the main areas of the EU budget, based on the (sub) headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020.
We are also looking at why and where errors have been made, we are making recommendations for improving and assessing whether and to what extent our previous recommendations have been implemented.
Finally, we provide information on budgetary and financial management and information on results.
This extensive work is the basis for our statement of assurance, which we must present to the European Parliament and the Council, in accordance with our mandate set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
EU general budget: opinion on the reliability of accounts and revenue: Limited opinion on expenditure In 2018, EU expenditure amounted to EUR 156.7 billion, representing 2.2% of the EU Member State's total expenditure and 1% of the EU's gross national income.
Our auditors examined a sample of 728 payments to beneficiaries in all spending areas in the EU budget, based on a population surveyed of around EUR 120 billion.
This means that we have analysed various cases where EU funds have been used to support key infrastructure projects, SMEs, research institutions, farmers and students in EU Member States or to support beneficiaries outside the EU.
For the 2018 financial year, we have issued an unreserved opinion on the reliability of the EU accounts and revenues.
In addition, in the third year in a row, we were able to present a limited opinion on EU expenditure 23.
About half of the expenditure audited does not show a significant error rate, as in previous years, it was found that the errors in EU expenditure were not exhaustive and that the payments were legal and regular, with the exception of high risk expenditure (mainly expenditure related to reimbursement, based on complex rules).
24 Overall, the Commission and the Member States maintained the error rate of 2.6% compared to the progress of the two previous years (financial year 2017: 2,4%; financial year 2016: 3,1 %).
We find this an encouraging sign.
What does that mean?
A mistake or incorrect payment is the amount of funds that could not be paid out of the EU budget because they have not been used in accordance with EU or national rules and are therefore not in line with the objectives set by the Council and Parliament or are in conflict with specific national rules in the Member States.
We evaluate the error rate by statistical methods, based on measurable (i.e. measurable measurable) errors that we have identified by checking the sample of transactions in the entire population of expenditure.
The most erroneous issue of the MFF: Economic, social and territorial cohesion In the financial year 2018, the area of "economic, social and territorial cohesion" was the most erroneous part of the MFF, followed by "Natural Resources" and "Competitiveness for Growth and Jobs" 25.
Annual report on the European Development Fund: Opinion on the reliability of accounts and revenue: Opinion on revenue; Limited Opinion on expenditure 26 European Development Fund (EDF) are the main instruments of EU development cooperation assistance.
The EFF aims to combat poverty and promote sustainable development and the integration of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the overseas countries and territories into the world economy.
The EFF shall be financed by the Member States of the Union and managed by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) outside the Union budget.
As in previous years, in respect of the financial year 2018, we issued an opinion without reservation on the reliability of EDF accounts and revenue, as well as on a limited opinion on EDF expenditure.
Special annual reports on EU agencies and joint enterprises EU agencies are separate entities with legal personality, set up to perform specific technical and scientific tasks and administrative tasks, thus contributing to the formulation and implementation of the policies of the EU institutions.
There are 43 agencies in total.
Joint enterprises are EU public-private partnerships with industry, research groups and Member States, which play an important role in the implementation of certain aspects of EU research policy.
The European Commission is a member of the public sector joint venture and represents the EU.
In total, there are eight joint ventures.
27 Note: The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020.
Unlimited audit opinion for all agencies except one; unlimited audit opinion for all joint enterprises Total for all agencies (except SRB) for the financial year 2018 total amount of EUR 4.2 billion, 20% more than in 2017 (EUR 3.5 billion), or around 2.9% of the total EU budget for 2018 (2017: 2.7%).
Overall, our audit of the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 2018 confirmed the positive results presented in previous years.
We have issued unlimited opinions on the reliability of the accounts, revenues and payments underlying the Agency's accounts, with the exception of EASO, with a limited opinion on payments.
We have also issued unlimited opinions to all joint enterprises on the reliability of the accounts, revenue and expenditure.
The launch of the discharge procedure by Parliament The publication of our annual reports is at the beginning of the discharge procedure, during which the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Council, decides whether the Commission and other bodies have managed the EU budget satisfactorily.
In October 2019 we presented our annual reports on the general budget of the EU and the EDF of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, followed by the plenary session of the European Parliament, the Council (ECOFIN) and the national parliaments and bodies of the 21 Member States.
28 Other annual reports: conditional commitments and European Schools We are obliged to report annually on all conditional commitments arising from the Single Committee on Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring.
In our report of 2018 we have come to the conclusion that the committee has improved the presentation of its financial statements, but better reporting of contingent obligations at national level is necessary.
We will also publish an annual report on the annual accounts of European schools.
Our 2018 review of the financial statements showed a significant error rate for one of the 13 European schools.
By means of digital digital control, it is about harnessing the potential of technology to provide more and better information in the accountability process.
Digital changes are also important for our test work and our organization.
We have set up a Steering Committee on Digitisation, composed of five members, to manage the changeover to the euro in the coming years.
As the first major audit initiative in 2019, we launched a pilot test to automate the audit of executive agencies' accounts.
As part of this pilot test, we will also benefit from traditional digital and traditional tools 29.
Opinions Opinions: a contribution to better lawmaking One way to strengthen the Commission's approach to better lawmaking is to publish an opinion on the Commission's proposals for new or revised legislation.
In the case of legislative proposals having a significant financial impact, the Court's opinions are required, in accordance with EU law.
In addition, other institutions may ask us to give an opinion on specific issues.
Our opinions will be forwarded to the European Parliament and the Council.
In 2019 we published three opinions: on the proposal for a European Union Office for Intellectual Property, the proposal for a Financial Regulation of the Single Committee for Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Resolution and the proposal for a Financial Regulation of the Community Plant Variety Office.
Our comments on the new Multiannual Financial Framework at the beginning of 2019 also published a summary of the ECA's comments on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.
This summary focuses on the proposed procedure for setting EU spending priorities, the flexibility of the EU budget, the focus on results and the simplification of governance, as well as on accountability and audit principles.
This analysis was mainly based on several opinions on the Commission proposals that we issued in 2018, but also on our latest thematic documents and other reports on EU funding.
We have achieved a relatively balanced number of publications throughout the year, reaching a climax in October, when we published our annual reports.
31 32 Combating fraud to the detriment of the EU's financial interests The Administrative Agreement signed with OLAF The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is at the heart of the fight against fraud to the detriment of the EU's financial interests.
We have adopted detailed guidelines for the management of the risk of fraud for our auditors.
We are giving OLAF any suspicion of fraud or any other illegal activity to the detriment of the EU's financial interests which arise during our audit work or which are reported to us.
These cases are then dealt with by OLAF, which shall decide on a possible investigation and, if necessary, cooperate with the authorities of the Member States.
In 2019 we also signed an administrative agreement setting out the operational rules for our cooperation with OLAF, including the coordination of training, workshops and the exchange of staff.
10 cases of alleged fraud were addressed to OLAF We are the external auditors of the EU.
Our attempts are not specifically designed to detect fraud.
However, our auditors regularly identify a number of cases where they suspect that they are engaged in fraudulent activities.
In 2019 we submitted 10 suspected cases of fraud to OLAF (2018: nine cases), including nine cases we encountered during our audits, as well as two cases that have affected third party attention.
Further information on the nature of the suspected fraud and on its recovery, as recommended by OLAF, is provided in our annual report on the EU general budget.
In 2019 we also published two special reports, which are closely related to the fight against fraud in EU expenditure: Special Report No 01/2019 on combating fraud in EU expenditure: action should be taken and Special Report No 06/2019 on combating fraud in EU expenditure: Managing authorities must step up action on detection, response and coordination.
33 Finally, we have devoted a special edition of the ECA newspaper to combat fraud and corruption and to protect the EU's financial interests.
Focusing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals at the heart of our audit work In recent years, in which we have focused on environmental and climate issues, sustainability issues have become extremely important.
In 2019 our sustainable development work was complemented by an analysis of the sustainable development report.
This analysis included an overview of how the EU institutions publish sustainable development information and how they contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development objectives of the United Nations.
We also organised a conference at the EuRH Forum on reporting on sustainable development in order to raise awareness and gather important stakeholders.
In July, we attended the OrkB presidents and stakeholders meeting on "OrkB on something moving: an assessment of the implementation of the SDGs" at the UN High Level political forum on the 2030 Agenda.
Finally, we published a special edition of the ECA journal on the SDG.
Audit Group: analysis: Sustainable development report: summary of EU institutions, bodies and agencies.
Institutional relations We work closely with the European Parliament (EP), the Council and the national parliaments in the Member States, as the impact of our work depends to a large extent on the benefits of our results and recommendations.
Our audit reports will be presented to the relevant European Parliament committees and Council working parties.
In addition, we present our annual reports, as well as our special reports and analyses to national Parliaments.
In 2019, the presentations of our reports to these institutional addressees increased even further, mainly due to the significant increase in presentations in national parliaments.
At the same time, as a result of the parliamentary break from mid-April to September 2019, fewer presentations to the EP 34 took place.
The meeting with the newly elected Presidents of the EU institutions in 2019 was the year of change with many EU institutions: after their election, our President met with the President of the European Parliament, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council.
35 President EuRH Lehne with President David Sassoli, President of the European Commission Ursula with Leyen and President of the Council Charles Michel.
The European Parliament Our members and control teams shall be regularly invited by the committees and bodies of the European Parliament to be invited by the Committee on Budgetary Control of this European Parliament.
In 2019 the elections to the European Parliament in May 2019 gave rise to special conditions as a result of which Parliamentary committees held meetings in mid-April and subsequently resumed in September.
We have presented 14 committees with 31 special reports and 10 analyses (2018: 39 reports and 14 committees).
After the elections, we launched an awareness-raising campaign to inform Members of the European Parliament of our activities as an EU external controller.
We also organised a number of workshops for EP staff.
Finally, in October 2019 we created an information portal, which will enable not only members of the EP, but also the general public to have easier access to our reports. 36
The Council of the European Union In 2019 our audit teams presented 22 Council working groups and two committees of 26 special reports (2018: 40 reports and 27 working groups).
We also presented two analyses: one for the Committee on Budgets at the informal Council meeting in Romania and the other for the Working Group on the 2030 Agenda.
We also participated in an exchange of views with the Financial Services Commission on the agreement with the European Central Bank and the Budget Committee on our draft budget for 2020 and in December 2019 we presented our work programme for 2020.
In October 2019, the President of the Eurogroup visited us to discuss the current state and future reforms of the Economic and Monetary Union and our potential contribution to financial and economic governance in the EU.

Member State governments and national parliaments More speeches in national parliaments Our Members regularly visit national parliaments and governments.
In 2019 we presented 90 presentations in 21 Member States (2018: 50 presentations in 14 Member States).
This is the highest number so far. 37
The European Commission Exchange of views with our authorities at the highest level For years it has been the most widely used practice for our members to organise an annual meeting with their counterparts in the Commission.
These meetings provide an opportunity to summarise and consider ways to further improve our cooperation.
The European Central Bank continued this tradition in June 2019 when President Jean-Claude Juncker invited our members to exchange views with the College of Commissioners in Brussels.
In October 2019 we signed an agreement with the European Central Bank which sets out practical rules for the exchange of information on the supervisory activities of the European Central Bank for our auditors.
Cooperation with the highest audit authorities (ORKB) Contact Committee of the annual EU-ORKB meeting in Poland in 2019. Cooperation with EU-ORKB takes place primarily within the EU-ORKB Contact Committee of EU-ORKB Presidents.
The EU-ORKB network allows us to support the activities of independent external financial control in the EU and in the Member States.
In June 2019 we took part in the annual meeting organized by ORKB Polska, which was also chaired by the president.
The discussions focused on the challenges and opportunities of the Digital Europe for the EU-ORKB.

The Public Health Examination Compendium in the EU In December 2019, we published a second examination compendium on behalf of the Contact Committee, in which the results of public health examinations conducted throughout the European Union were presented.
The Compendium provides basic information on public health, its legal bases, its main objectives and related competences at Member State and EU level, and on the main challenges facing the EU and its Member States.
It is based on the current findings of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors of the 23 EU Member States.
In 2019 we started preparatory work on the third audit compendium to be published in 2020 and which will address the issue of cybersecurity 40.

Performance Measurements We use key performance indicators (KPIs) to inform our management about progress in our strategic goals, to support decision-making and to provide our institutional addressees with information about our achievements.
These KPIs provide a comprehensive picture of how we organize our work in terms of dissemination, impact and perception.
In 2019, according to the plan, we publish 36 reports We monitor the number and timeliness of reports published throughout the year.
In 2019 we published 36 reports: 25 special reports and 11 analyses.
This corresponds to the number of publications provided for in the work programme.
The number of special reports and analyses published 47 In addition, we have issued six annual reports, three opinions, 18 audit analyses and four other publications.
In total, we have prepared 67 publications during the year.
Media presence A constant increase in reporting in social media We follow media transmission in our work and in our institution, which may vary considerably depending on the subject and complexity of the report.
At the same time, external factors can have a major impact on media interest in our publications.
This may be the case, for example, where the date of publication of the report coincides with an important event or policy development, which may significantly increase the public interest in the case in question.
In 2019 over 50 000 free articles and online articles were recorded in social media.
49 In 2019 we discovered a significant increase in the contribution to social media, which is also due to the more active use of these communication channels during the year.
We strengthened our contacts with the press In 2019 we strengthened our contacts with the press and the media.
We have done so by issuing 61 press releases in 23 EU languages (2018: 76), as well as numerous short press releases and tips in certain languages; 25 press releases (2018: 20), including press releases for the sector and countries related to the annual report.
These press meetings usually take place in Brussels.
We have also received journalists from Brussels and Member States who have organised on-the-spot visits and have organised several meetings on selected reports for industry stakeholders, NGOs and stakeholders.

The impact and perception of our work 88% of stakeholders believe that our audit reports are useful We assess the likely impact and usefulness of our audit work on the basis of feedback from our stakeholders from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the EU agencies, the permanent representations of the Member States, the public authorities of the Member States and the European Economic and Social Committee, non-governmental organisations, science, the media and other parties.
Since 2018, we have been asking our stakeholders for an opinion on the selection of special reports and analyses and on the annual report through anonymous electronic surveys.
These studies will enable interested parties to comment on the quality of the reports and to make general proposals on the Court's work.
A total of 88% of respondents confirmed the relevance of our reports to their work in 2019 and 81% confirmed their effectiveness.
52 Monitoring our recommendations Almost all of our recommendations are implemented We determine the state of play of our recommendations on the basis of the actions taken by our controllers.
In 2019 we analysed the recommendations presented in our special reports published in 2015 and in the annual report of the same year.
This analysis shows that 96% of the recommendations made by us in our 2015 Annual Report and 94% of the recommendations in our Special Reports published in 2015 have been fully, largely or partially implemented 53.
Our employees at the end of 2019 had 853 permanent and temporary posts (2018: 853 posts), including 534 posts in examination chambers, including 118 posts in the study of members.

Equal opportunities The Court ensures equal opportunities for its employees at all levels of the organisation.
Overall, we have a balanced participation of women and men among our employees.
In 2019 about one third of our directors and directors are women.
57 Support for control activities Vocational training record number of training activities In 2019 we continued to diversify and expand the offer of training for our employees.

Information technology, work environment and innovation The transition to cloud-based services The transition to cloud-based services is an important milestone that provides an easy-to-use system for various end-user applications (IT, personnel, office, security, etc.).
The new IT Security Action Plan has achieved a number of objectives, such as a more effective and regular removal of software barriers, preventing unauthorised access to cloud services, control of information security management and improvement of security oversight capabilities.
Finally, an ambitious technical programme was implemented in 2019 to provide facilities and systems to enable all workers to operate more flexibly, e.g. office, teleconferences and mobile work.
New open access policy In 2019 we also adopted a new open access policy.
The re-use of documents and the process of sharing our data will be determined in cooperation with the Publications Office 59.
ECALAB ECALAB, our interdisciplinary team of innovation laboratories, continued research into technologies such as text mining, artificial intelligence and process mining.
In 2019 ECALAB also started to support a number of control tasks.
The Audit Technology and Innovation Network In November 2019 at the Big and Open Data conference held at our premises in Luxembourg, we also established the EU-ORKB Audit Technology and Innovation Network (TINA).
Big and open date conference, November 2019, Luxembourg.
In order to support the development of the European infrastructure for blocking services by the European Commission and the Member States on the basis of our 'declaration', another EU-ORKB network for blocking technologies in the control area 60 has been set up.
The Farm Building currently has three buildings ("K1, "K2" and "K3"), which constitute one integrated technical unit.
K1 K1 building opened in 1988 includes office rooms for up to 310 staff and conference rooms.
In the bullets there are parking lots, technical equipment, warehouses, library and main archive, while the entire top floor is used for technical installations.

In accordance with the March 2014 Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Court will use the remaining budgetary resources from the construction project K3 completed a few years ago to finance this modernisation 61.
In the bullets there are parking lots, technical equipment, warehouses, warehouses, warehouses, waste storage facilities, printers, kitchens and archives.
In addition, in this building there are offices for 503 employees, conference rooms and IT room.
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is rated as "very good" 62 on the basis of the world's leading "Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method" (BREEAM).
Further increasing our security measures In 2019 we took a number of measures to increase the security of our buildings in Luxembourg.
Among them was the establishment of a team of armed security personnel.
We have an agreement with the Luxembourg police, which allows us to use national training centres.
Furthermore, we have agreed with the European External Action Service that we will support our auditors in their visits to high-risk countries.

Environmental governance As an EU institution, we have an obligation to respect the principle of sound environmental management in all activities.
We continue to systematically reduce our CO2 emissions and regularly analyse greenhouse gas emissions caused by our actions.
In 2018, total greenhouse gas emissions amounted to 10 178 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), representing a 3% reduction compared to 2017.
We are proud of our EMAS certification for environmental management and audit: we successfully run an EMAS-compliant environmental management system and fully meet the certification requirements of ISO 14001:2015.
In the last quarter of 2019, an external EMAS audit was carried out, which led to the renewal of EMAS certification for the period 2020-2022.
New initiatives such as the "Plastic ESRB" initiative will be implemented as planned.
In 2019, in cooperation with the Luxembourg Ministry of Agriculture, we also created four hives in our gardens.
Bees are supervised by volunteers.
We assume that this will have a positive impact on the sustainability of pollinators in our surroundings 64.
The Court's liability The Court's financial information is financed by the general budget of the European Union and its budget falls under the heading of administrative expenditure.
In 2019 our budget was around 147 million euro, of which 98% was used during the year.
This represents less than 0,1% of the total EU expenditure or around 1.5% of the total EU administrative expenditure.

Internal audit and external audit Internal audit body shall advise the Court on issues relating to risk management.
It provides independent and objective guarantees and advice to increase and improve the added value of the Court's activities.
In addition, they shall report to the Internal Audit Committee, consisting of three members of the Court and one external expert.
The Committee shall regularly monitor progress in the implementation of the various tasks set out in the annual work programme of the internal audit body and shall ensure its independence.
In 2019, the Internal Audit Service carried out three selected tasks: "the risks and challenges of the Audit Quality Control Committee', "the travel costs of high-level members and officials, costs for the representation of members and the use of the Court's fleet' and "the Court's vocational training'.
In addition, our risk management strategy and three annual declarations of sub-delegated authorising officers have been examined.
In addition, the Internal Audit Department monitored the implementation of its previous recommendations, ensuring that the agreed action plans were implemented, and advised on issues related to the Court's new internal control framework.
Our internal auditor has not demonstrated any shortcomings which, due to their nature or scope, could seriously undermine the overall credibility of internal control systems; the control systems were introduced by the authorising officer by delegation to ensure the legality and regularity of the Court's financial operations in 2019.
External audit Our financial statements are audited by an independent external auditor.
This study is very important because it shows that we apply the same principles of transparency and accountability to ourselves as to the bodies we study.
The auditor's report on the Court's accounts for the financial year 2018 was published on 4 April 2019. 67
The Court's independent auditor's opinion on the Court's accounts for the financial year 2018 68: "After our assessment, the annual accounts shall present a true and fair view of the financial and financial situation of the European Court of Auditors on 31 December 2018 and the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in net assets for the year ending on that date, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).
OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1) as amended, hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Regulation', and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 148/2012 of 29 October 2012 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1) as amended, hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Regulation'.
(OJ L 362, 31.12.2012, p. 1) on the rules for the application of the Financial Regulation and its subsequent amendments.';
Regarding the use of the resources and the Court's audit procedure: "In the framework of our actions described in this report, we have not been in a situation where it could be concluded that, in all the relevant matters and taking into account the above-mentioned evaluation criteria, the appropriations allocated to the Court have not been used for the purposes and, in the framework of the audit procedures laid down, that the financial transactions have been carried out in accordance with the rules and regulations in force."
The discharge for the financial year 2017 Like the other EU institutions, the Court is subject to the discharge procedure.
In March 2019 the European Parliament granted our Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of our budget for the financial year 2017.
As every year, during the discharge procedure, we have carefully analysed all the problems we have with our responsibility for audit and management, we have taken the appropriate steps, and we have carefully reported our follow-up to the European Parliament.
Mutual evaluation of our ethical framework Finally, in 2019 our ethical framework was subjected to an external evaluation by ORB of Poland and Croatia.
This report was finalised in January 2020 69
The statement by the authorising officer by delegation in accordance with Article 74 (9) of the Financial Regulation The statement by the authorising officer by delegation below the signed Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors hereby declares that, as authorising officer by delegation, the information contained in this report, as well as the additional internal information in order to fulfil my duties, including financial and management information, including the results of the checks, is correct and accurate, and that, with sufficient certainty, the appropriations made available for the activities described in this report, have been used for the purposes provided for in this report and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, shall be proportionate to the costs and benefits of the checks.

PL 2013 Brief information on the EU review Presentation of the annual reports of the European Court of Auditors for the financial year 2013
Preface by the President 02 Each year in November, the European Court of Auditors shall present the results of its annual audits of the EU financial management in the previous financial year.
On the basis of the audit evidence obtained, the Court guarantees the reliability of the use of EU funds and stresses the extent to which the risk that EU funds have not been fully used has been the greatest.
The reports also contain recommendations on possible improvements in EU financial management.
In this way, the Court supports the European Parliament and the Council in the review of EU expenditure and contributes to the effective performance of the calculation duties towards EU citizens.
This Shorter Shorter Shorter Shorter Shorter Shorter Shorter EU Verification presented and explained the most important findings in our annual report on the implementation of the EU budget in 2013 or through the European Development Fund.
As in previous years, reports show to what extent the bodies responsible for the financial management of the EU and at national level have fully demonstrated the management of the financial resources, ensured the application of EU financial rules and complied with the basic principles of savings, efficiency and efficiency.
2013 was the last year of the seven-year programming period and we publish our progress reports for this financial year during a transitional period of major importance for the EU and its finances.
As our reports show, the new European Parliament and the new Commission have faced the long-standing and new challenges of financial management and accountability in the current 2014-2020 programming period.
Continued emphasis on EU and national finances requires careful management and control of EU funds and better forecasting of long-term financing needs.
In particular, we stress in our reports that the Commission and the authorities of the Member States in their EU budget should make greater efforts to ensure that EU funds are used to achieve results that could otherwise not be achieved in an equally effective or effective way.
At the same time, the Court's audit results show that further action can and should be taken to ensure that EU action is in line with the rules.
The Court will be pleased to take the opportunity to help the new European Parliament and the Commission to address these and other problems related to financial management and calculation obligations at EU level.
To this end, on the basis of our experience with control, we have also prepared two land control analyses, which have identified the main challenges facing the EU in terms of computing, auditing and financial management.
Mr Vítor Manuel da Silva CALDEIRA President of the European Court of Auditors

Overall results 04 Main conclusions Summary of the 2013 Statement of Assurance The European Court of Auditors (ECA, Court) gives an opinion on the reliability of the European Union accounts for 2013.
General revenue for 2013 is legal and regular.
The 2013 budget commitments are generally legal and regular.
Payments for 2013 are largely affected by errors.
The Court therefore gives its opinion on the lack of legality and regularity.
The text of the Statement of Assurance is set out in Chapter 1 of the Annual Report for the financial year 2013. The Court estimates the error rate of 4.7 % in 2013 compared to the error rate for 2012 (4.8 %) and at a constant level above the materiality threshold at a level of 2 %. ο Overall, the audited supervisory and control systems in 2013 ensured that the level of regularity of payments compared to the error rates in 2012 (4,8%) and that the error rate in the two areas of regional policy, transport and energy at a level of 6,9% and in rural development, the environment, fisheries and health at a level of 6,7%.
The total error rate in shared management, including in agriculture: market support, direct payments and employment and social affairs, was estimated at 5.2%. ο The remedial actions and recovery by the authorities in the Member States and the Commission had a positive impact on the estimated error rate.
General results 05 Appropriate use of EU funds EU funds for 2013. Each year the Court reviews EU revenue and expenditure and participates in the assessment of the reliability of the annual accounts and in the assessment of expenditure and revenue in accordance with rules and rules.
In 2013, spending from the EU budget amounted to EUR 148.5 billion or around EUR 290 per citizen.
These expenditures account for around 1% of the EU's gross national income and account for around 2% of the total public expenditure of the EU Member States.
The EU budget is adopted annually by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of the seven-year financial framework.
It is first of all the Commission's responsibility to ensure that the budget is spent properly.
In the case of around 80% of expenditure, in particular in the field of agriculture and cohesion, the Commission shares this with the EU Member States.
Where's the money coming from?
The EU budget is financed from different sources.
The largest share is payments made by Member States on the basis of their gross national income (EUR 110,0 billion).
Other sources include payments made by Member States on the basis of VAT (EUR 14.5 billion) and agricultural duties and duties (EUR 15.4 billion).
The annual EU budget is spent in a number of policy areas (see Figure 1).
Payments are intended to support different activities, such as research projects, unemployment training or agricultural production.
Total results 06 Expenditure 2013 6,9% Administrative and related expenditure 8,9% Research and other internal policies 9.4% Employment and social affairs 9.9% Rural development, environment, fisheries and health 4.2 % External relations, external assistance and enlargement 2013 EUR 148.5 billion 30,4 % Regional policy, transport and energy 30,3% Agriculture: Market support and direct payments Audit results 2013 The key element of the Court's audit work is the audit of random sample transactions from all parts of the EU budget in order to obtain statistical estimates of the extent to which irregularities in revenue and the various expenditure areas.
The 2013 results are summarised in Figure 2.
For more information on the Court's approach to the audit and assessment of the most likely error rate, see page 35.

Overall results 07 In 2013, the Court concluded that revenue was not significantly affected by errors.
For the general budget of expenditure, the estimated error rate is 4,7%, leading to a wrong opinion on the regularity of expenditure (see page 36 for an explanation of the concept of "solvency").
For more information on the specific expenditure areas, see pages 18-34 and pages 18-34 and the corresponding chapters of the annual report for the financial year 2013.

This figure is close to the 2012 error rate (4,8%) and is constantly above the materiality threshold of 2% (see Figure 4). Estimated error rate for the EU budget overall (2007-2013) EU expenditure 10% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% 6,9% 5,8% 4,8% 4,8% 3,3% 3,7% 3,9 % 2007 2008 Upper error limit 2009 2010 2010 2012 2013 % Estimated error rate Lower error limit Note: The Court uses standard statistical methods to estimate the most likely error rate.
The Court is 95 percent sure that the error rate for the population is within the range from the lower error limit to the upper error limit.
For further details, see Annex 1.1 and Annex 1.3 to Chapter 1 of the annual report.
Overall results 09 Errors, waste and abuse The Court's assessment of the error rate is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste.
This is a harmful part of the funds that could not be paid because they were not used in accordance with the rules in force.
Typical errors include payments for ineligible expenditure or purchases for which procurement rules have not been correctly applied.
Fraud is a deliberate fraud aimed at obtaining benefits.
The Court shall refer the cases under review and suspected fraud to OLAF (the Anti-Fraud Office of the European Union), which shall be responsible for carrying out any further investigations in cooperation with the authorities in the Member States.
A comparison of the error rates estimated for the different expenditure areas is shown in Figure 5.
Greater amounts in the field of research and other internal policies and in the field of administrative and related expenditure have been compensated by lower amounts in the field of rural development, the environment, fisheries and health and external relations, external assistance and enlargement.
As in 2012, two areas of expenditure in the area of regional policy, transport and energy, as well as rural development, the environment, fisheries and health were the most defective.
These two areas, together with the other two areas of shared management (agricultural: market support and direct payments and employment and social affairs), show an estimated 5,2 % error rate.
For all other operational expenditure (mainly managed directly by the Commission), the estimated error rate was 3.7 %.
Moreover, the Court noted an estimated error rate of 1,0% in administrative expenditure.
Overall results 10 Comparison of estimated error rates in the different areas of EU spending for 2012 and 2013 8% 6% 4% 2% 0 6.8 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 2012 7.9% 3.8 % 3,6% 3.2 % 3.1 % 3.6% 3.6% 3.6% 3.6% 3.6% 0% 0.8% regional policy, transport and energy Agriculture: market support and direct payments Employment and social development of rural areas, environment, fisheries and health Research and other internal policies External relations, external assistance and the extension of administrative expenditure and associated expenditure on graph 5
General results 11 Breakdown of the estimated overall error rate by expenditure area and by type of error Regional policy, transport and energy Agriculture: market support and direct payments Rural development, environment, fisheries and health Social and other internal policies External policy, external assistance and enlargement Administrative expenditure and related expenditure 4.7% Errors in agricultural areas Serious infringements of public procurement rules Unqualified projects, actions or beneficiaries Inclusion of ineligible costs in 1.8 % of expenditure Estimated error rate in the EU budget Total % Share of the overall error rate (in percentage points) 2.1% 1.1% 0.7% Other error types 0.3% 0.1% 0.1% % error rate in total 0.6% 1,0% 1,1% Share of the estimated total error rate by type of error broken down by expenditure category 6
Overall results 12 The Court analyses the contribution of the different types of errors and the different expenditure areas to the estimated overall error rate (see Figure 6).
Expenditure which did not meet the necessary conditions for the implementation of projects financed by the EU accounted for the largest part of the estimated total error rate (including ineligible costs in the cost statement: 39% or 1.8 percentage points of the estimated total error rate).
Secondly, projects for which either the financed action or the beneficiary should not have received support in accordance with the applicable rules (non-qualifying projects/actions or beneficiaries: 22% or 1.1 percentage points of the estimated total error rate).
As the largest expenditure area, which is still the largest estimated error rate, the area of regional policy, transport and energy is by far the largest source of the estimated overall error rate (44% or 2.1 pro-points of the estimated overall error rate).
Agriculture: Market support and direct payments, where the level of expenditure was almost the same, contribute approximately half as much to the estimated overall error rate.
Recovery measures have a positive impact on the level of error in the Member States and the Commission by applying corrective measures to protect the EU budget in the case of ineffective control systems or irregular expenditure.
If such corrective action had not been taken with regard to payments in 2013, which the Court had audited, the estimated total error rate in 2013 would have been 6,3% instead of 4,7%.
However, the estimated error rate could be further reduced by better application of existing control systems and corrective actions.
The Court found that, in the case of a significant proportion of the errors in shared management, the authorities in the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct errors before applying for a refund to the Commission.
For example, this would reduce the estimated level of error in regional policy, transport and energy from 6.9% to 3.9%, in rural development, the environment, fisheries and health from 6.7% to 2.0%, and in employment and social affairs from 3.1% to 1.9%.
New challenges related to the provision of reliable financial information There is no clear distinction between the main types of correction and the information provided to a large extent outside the accounting system in the reports of the above corrective corrections.
This hinders a more in-depth analysis and reduces the accuracy of the accounting data and the related financial statements.
Further changes are the increasing use of financial instruments supporting investment in potentially viable projects in the form of loans, guarantees, equity and other risk mechanisms.
Due to the complexity of financial instruments, the assessment and recording of financial instruments require particular care in accordance with the international public sector accounting principles.
Overall results 13 Continuous increase in amounts to be financed from future budgets The main features of EU budgetary and financial management in 2013 include: ο a significant increase in the amount of payments that the Commission could make in the amending budgets: 9.6% of the original budget; ο a steady increase in the commitments that in the future will amount to payments (by 2.6%) despite the large amount of payments; ο a long period (on average over two years) between the date of the initial budgetary commitment and the date of acceptance of the statement of expenditure by the Commission; ο only 37% of the appropriations for the financial instruments were paid to the final beneficiaries at the end of 2012; ο refunds, interest and dividends of EUR 259 million that were collected since 2008 - were not included as revenue.
What are commitments and payments?
The EU budget consists of two elements: commitments (amounts to be paid in the current year or in the coming years) and payments (amounts to be paid in the current year).
Payments may only be made in respect of important budgetary commitments.
The annual ceilings for commitment and payment appropriations shall be set out in the multiannual financial framework agreed by the Council and Parliament.
The nature of EU spending programmes, in particular the long period between commitment and payment, creates increasing pressure on future payment budgets.
This is due to the much higher payment budget in 2013 and this trend will continue in the same way in future budgets.
General results 14 How does the Court consider that budgetary and financial management can increase the accuracy of data by collecting information under traditional accounting systems; ο shall record and evaluate all financial instruments and financial instruments in accordance with internationally recognised accounting rules in the public sector, in particular through reliable procedures for the determination and recording of impairments; ο shall provide information on the cash that is maintained until the final beneficiaries are paid; ο shall draw up and publish forecasts of the long-term cash flows that are updated annually, which would make it easier for stakeholders to identify future payment needs and to identify budgetary priorities. ο For more information on this subject?
Full information on the main findings of the audit can be found in Chapter 1 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
The overall results of EU 15 funds and their results should be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management (savings, efficiency and efficiency).
In this context, input data (financial, personal, material, organisational or regulatory), results (to be achieved under the programme), results (to be achieved by the programme, initial changes to the programme among direct or direct beneficiaries) and impacts (long-term social changes, at least partly linked to EU action) are needed to achieve good results.
The Court assesses these aspects in its economic audits.
The effectiveness of the use of EU funds in the 2007-2013 programming period, which focuses on absorption (use it or fate it in the event of non-use) and on compliance and not on good results, is not given sufficient attention.
For example, when selecting projects for EU funding, there was a need to use the EU funds available; there was a need to comply with the rules, but only in the third place, but only to a certain extent to achieve results and results.
This focus on results is crucial in the way a large part of the EU budget is built.
According to the Commission, the focus for the 2014-2020 programming period is more on mitigation, with the performance reserve being the main stimulus.
With these reserves, the Commission will retain 6 percent of the resources allocated to individual Member States until they are considered satisfactory.
However, in practice, the input and output indicators will remain broadly in line with the release of measures.
The performance indicators will only be applied by the Commission in certain areas.
The more efficient functioning of performance-related reserves will depend on how effectively the Commission will negotiate the relevant intermediate objectives and objectives at the beginning of the programming period and on whether the Member States will obtain accurate, reliable and up-to-date data to determine whether these objectives have been achieved.
The reporting framework is not appropriate for the desired culture of results The implementation reports are divided into several general reports at the level of the general budget.
These reports do not provide information on progress towards the Europe 2020 objectives and do not provide a complete picture of the results of the EU added value.
However, the fourth evaluation report is a step in the right direction, as it seeks to combine the main financial programmes with the available information on the results that are relevant to the Europe 2020 strategy.
At the level of each Directorate-General of the Commission, the performance targets in policy areas of their competence shall be set out in the management plans and then presented in the annual activity reports.
The Court's analysis of the management plans and the annual reports on the activities of the Commission's DG has shown that the assurance of reliability is limited to the aspects of the regularity and internal control and that it does not take account of the performance aspects.
Moreover, the objectives are too general to be used for management purposes, and the selected indicators are not always suitable for the purposes of measuring the results.
Overall results 16 The added value of EU spending is not always demonstrated In 19 special reports adopted by the Court in 2013, in the framework of performance control, a wide range of issues were discussed and the EU intervention was assessed in accordance with the principles of sound financial management (savings, efficiency and efficiency).
The Court examined the conclusions of its special reports adopted in 2013 in order to prepare new programmes and projects for the 2014-2020 programming period and concluded that the EU added value could not always be guaranteed. ο In many cases, i.e. the beneficiaries carried out activities without EU support.
Example: The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides compensation to workers affected by collective redundancies.
The Court found that a third of the support would be used for actions that would still be paid by the Member States (Special Report No 7/2013 on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which, in the context of the reintegration of redundant workers, would bring EU added value? on the reintegration of redundant workers).
For example, the Commission's risk-sharing funding mechanism has not shown enough that EU funding under the risk-sharing financing instrument (the financing instrument aimed at facilitating access to debt financing in the field of research) leads to more investment than in the event that the beneficiaries would not invest public funds in it (Special Report No 2/2013 did not ensure the Commission's effective implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research? not enough).
Overall results 17 Most of the Court's recommendations have been implemented Follow-up of the Court's recommendations as a result of the audit of budgetary implementation are a key element of the cycle of responsibility and can contribute to the effective implementation by the Commission of the recommendations contained in the reports.
The Court examined how the Commission's recommendations in the eight special reports adopted in 2007-2010 were fully or largely implemented by the Commission and concluded that 79% of the recommendations were adopted by the Commission.
The Court recommends the Commission: ο Commission should improve the reporting framework for the next revision of the Financial Regulation. ο Commission should ensure that the evaluation report contains a summary report that gathers all available information on the progress made towards the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. ο Commission should continue to develop its performance and reporting management system so that it can assume responsibility for sound financial management and the contribution of the EU budget to achieving the policy objectives.
Full information on the Court's evaluation of the results can be found in Chapter 10 of the EU budget and Chapter 10 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
All special reports are available on the Court's website: http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/AuditReports Opinions.aspx.
The contributions calculated on the basis of the gross national income (GNI) of the Member States or on the basis of VAT collected from the Member States represented respectively 74% and 10% of income in 2013.
Import duties and the sugar production levy collected by the Member States' authorities on behalf of the EU accounted for 10% of EU revenue and the remaining 6% of other revenue.
Explanations on the assessment of EU revenue The EU revenue based on GNI and VAT shall be calculated on the basis of macroeconomic statistics and estimates provided by the Member States.
The Court's audit of the regularity of the underlying transactions concerns the processing of the data by the Commission, but does not concern the preliminary collection of the data by the authorities of the Member States.
Consequently, the Court's request concerns the impact of any errors of the Commission on the total amount of revenue.
As regards duties, the Court examines how the Commission is acting in the manner in which the Member States provide information on the entitlements established.
These data are not sufficiently harmonised among Member States.
The reservation is an instrument allowing for the possibility of correction for the element concerned in the GNI data transmitted by the Member State.
There is a general reservation for Greek GNI data for 2008 and 2009 as these data are still based on preliminary estimates.
This aspect is part of the problem of Greece's national accounts.
For more information on revenue and expenditure areas 19 The customs authorities of the Member States shall carry out checks to verify that importers comply with customs and import rules.
The Court found that the quality of the checks was very diverse in the Member States visited.
This may lead to a decision by importers to notify goods in a Member State other than that in which they are established in order to reduce the likelihood of controls and to impede the collection of the fees due.
One example of such activities is the case of the importer who landed Chinese textiles in Hamburg (Germany), who introduced them to Rotterdam, where they were declared for free circulation, and then exported them to Poland for final sale.
Our recommendations The Court recommends the Commission: ο The Commission should seek to harmonise the methods for the calculation of business data which is not being observed. ο The Commission should draw up a detailed action plan containing clear steps of action and closely monitor its implementation in order to address the problems of the preparation of Greece's national accounts. ο The Commission should establish minimum standards of controls to be carried out by the customs authorities of the Member States in order to allow for a better focus on high-risk importers.
Full information on the Court's audit of EU revenue can be found in Chapter 2 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
20 This expenditure area includes the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF), one of the two main instruments of the EU's common agricultural policy.
The aim of this policy is to increase the productivity of agriculture, to ensure an adequate standard of living for the agricultural population, to stabilise markets, to ensure supplies and to ensure supplies at reasonable prices for consumers.
Expenditure shall be managed shared with the Member States.
Yes Estimated error rate: 3.6 % (2012): 3.8 %) Audit systems examined: conditionally effective Most of the expenditure in this area is calculated on the basis of agricultural land.
Many quantified errors are the result of inaccuracies in the applications of the beneficiaries, and most of the time they are too large in the area data (see example).
Example: A clear application for aid for land not eligible In Germany, Ireland, Greece, France, Poland and Romania*, some areas for which payments were made were areas in which areas were not eligible which were, in fact, wholly or partly covered by areas which were not eligible for aid (trees or bushes).
For these ineligible areas, Union aid could not be paid.
In Greece, this error occurred because this land has been classified as eligible grassland and has been properly included in the agricultural parcel identification system. * Guidance indicating the Member States in the examples: the sampling method applied by the Court is not examined in each Member State each year, in each Member State and/or in the region receiving the aid.
Examples of errors are designed to illustrate the most common types of errors.
They do not give rise to conclusions on the Member States, beneficiary countries and/or regions concerned.
For all direct aid schemes under the EAGF, beneficiaries of EU aid are legally obliged to comply with the existing obligations (cross compliance principle) concerning the protection of the environment, human, animal and plant health and animal welfare, as well as the protection of land in good agricultural and environmental condition.
Where farmers fail to comply with those obligations, their aid shall be reduced.
During the audit, the Court found infringements in 25% of the cases of infringements of those obligations.
In the event of a significant number of errors, the authorities of the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before submitting a request for reimbursement to the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors prior to the Commission's notification of expenditure, the estimated error rate in this respect would have been 2,5%.
More information on revenue and expenditure areas 21 The Court's examination of integrated management and control systems (IACS) in four Member States (Germany, Ireland, France and Italy) has identified shortcomings in the management and quality control procedures for databases in the three Member States (Ireland, France and Italy), ο shortcomings in the quality of on-the-spot checks in the two Member States (Germany and Italy), ο shortcomings in the procedures for the recovery of amounts unduly paid in the two Member States (Ireland and Italy).
Despite the weaknesses identified during the audit, the CCS contributes significantly to the prevention of errors in the expenditure covered by the scheme.
In the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or later, producer groups in the fruit and vegetables sector may receive EU aid.
In order to be considered a producer group, certain conditions concerning the number and relative size of the members must be fulfilled.
The Court found that nine of the 40 sampled producer groups in Poland did not meet these conditions.
In its 2013 Annual Activity Report, the Commission stated that it reserved 25% of all expenditure related to the activity in Poland.
Our recommendations The Court recommends: ο The Commission and the Member States should take the necessary steps to ensure that the potential of the HACCP system is fully exploited, for example in order to ensure that the eligibility and size of agricultural parcels are properly assessed and recorded. ο The Commission should monitor corrective action in the light of shortcomings in EU aid to producer groups in Poland.
Full information on the Court's audit of EU expenditure on market support and direct payments in the field of agriculture can be found in Chapter 3 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
22 This expenditure area covers the policy areas "Rural development of rural areas village, "climate and environmental policy," "maritime," "fishery," "health," "consumer," "health," "health and consumer protection," "environment," "environment," "environment," "environment" and "environment," "environment" and "environment," "health and consumer protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment" and "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection" and "environment protection," "environment protection" and "environment protection," "health and consumer protection," "environment protection," "environment," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection," "environment protection" and "environment protection" and "environment protection."
88% of payments in this area come from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Expenditure shall be managed shared with the Member States.
The EAFRD co-finances rural development expenditure under the relevant Member States' programmes.
Expenditure includes area measures (e.g. agri-environment payments and compensatory payments to farmers in areas with natural handicaps) and non-area measures (e.g. modernisation of agricultural holdings and service infrastructure for the economy and the rural population).
Thus Estimated error rate: 6.7 % (2012): 7.9 %) Control systems that were analysed: conditionally effective Most errors were due to non-compliance with eligibility conditions, in particular the following conditions: agri-environmental commitments (see example), specific requirements for investment projects and public procurement rules.
Example: Non-compliance with agri-environmental commitments The farmer in Sardinia in Italy received compensation for not using environmentally harmful plant protection products for artichoke cultivation.
During the on-the-spot check, the Court found that the beneficiary had applied such plant protection products 12 times during the period considered.
Therefore, the payment of the aid could not be considered compatible with the internal market.
Similar cases of non-compliance with agri-environmental commitments were also detected in the Piemonte region (Italy) and Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.
For more information on revenue and expenditure areas 23 In the event of a significant number of errors, Member State authorities had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before submitting a request for reimbursement to the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors before reporting to the Commission, the estimated error rate in this respect would have been 2.0%.
The Court's analysis of rural development control systems showed that: ο shortcomings in the control of eligibility conditions, e.g. failure to recover VAT amounts or risk of double funding (in seven of the eight Member States surveyed: Germany, Spain, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovenia; in Poland, except); ο insufficient assessment of the reliability of costs (in all four Member States surveyed: in Italy, Latvia, Poland and Romania); ο shortcomings in the formulation and implementation of cross-compliance controls (in all four Member States surveyed: in the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy and Malta); ο insufficient assessment of the reliability of costs (in all Member States surveyed: in all four Member States: in Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy and Malta); ο insufficient assessment of the reliability of costs (in all Member States: in Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy and Malta); ο shortcomings in the control of cross-compliance in all four Member States: in Italy, Italy, Italy and Malta); ο shortcomings in the assessment of compliance with the principle of environmental and social standards to be eligible for aid; ο shortcomings in all Member States: Italy, Italy and Italy.
For example, insufficient controls on public procurement rules by a Member State in Latvia have been granted by the paying agency to the EAFRD in the amount of EUR 2 million to finance the information system that was outsourced on the basis of the public procurement rules.
The Court found that a number of serious errors were found in the procurement of the IT system and in subsequent procurements.
For example, the paying agency used a negotiated procedure instead of an open or restricted procedure, in accordance with the law.
Due to non-compliance with the required procedures, expenditure is not eligible for EU funding.
Our recommendations The Court recommends in the field of rural development the following recommendations: ο Member States should improve the implementation of existing administrative controls by using all relevant information available to the paying agencies.
In this way, most errors could be detected and corrected. ο Member States should ensure that action plans aimed at countering the high estimated error rate in rural development, take into account all regions and take into account all investment activities in particular and take into account the Commission's and Court's audit findings.

More information on revenue and expenditure on regional policy, transport and energy EUR 45.5 billion As part of our audit, 24 this audit focused on regional policy (including 96% of payments in this area of expenditure), financed mainly from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF).
Regional policy aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by reducing regional disparities.
Expenditure on regional policy actions shall be subject to joint management by the Commission and the Member States under which projects under approved expenditure programmes are co-financed.
The remaining 4 % of expenditure audited covers transport and energy policy areas.
Transport and energy policy aims to provide European citizens and businesses with safe, sustainable and competitive transport and energy systems and services.
These expenditure shall be managed directly by the Commission.
Thus estimated error rate: 6,9% (2012: 6,8%) The control systems that have been audited: Depending on the circumstances, the Court found serious errors in the award of public contracts, which account for 39% of the error rate estimated by the Court.
The total value of 122 tender procedures audited is estimated at EUR 4.2 billion.
Example: Unjustified contracts for additional works at a passenger terminal at an airport in Germany were awarded to the original contractor by free hand.
These additional work was necessary because of the obscene preparation, planning and implementation of the project, and not because of unpredictable circumstances.
In such cases, the contract could not be awarded free of charge and, therefore, it would be necessary to publish the contract for additional works.
Similar cases in which projects in Belgium, the Czech Republic, other places in Germany and Spain, Italy and Sweden were not justified have been identified.
More information on revenue and expenditure areas 25 The Court's auditors also check whether EU state aid rules are being complied with.
Illegal State aid confers an undue advantage on the beneficiaries and therefore affects the internal market.
The State aid errors represented 17% of the estimated error rate in this area (see example).
For example, State aid for a cost-effective project for a small or medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) in Slovenia was granted for research and development in the automotive industry.
However, SMEs were wholly owned by large enterprises and were fully carrying out their research solely on their behalf.
As large companies are subject to stricter public funding rules, the company was not entitled to full funding.
Similar cases have been reported in Bulgaria and Hungary.
In the event of a significant number of errors, Member States' authorities had sufficient information to detect and correct errors before submitting a request to the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors before reporting to the Commission, the estimated error rate in this area would have been 3,9%.
The Court's auditors also found that in 2013 the amounts of payments to the final beneficiaries continued to be increased in the financial instruments.
These funds support enterprises or urban development projects through capital investments, loans or guarantees.
Funds will be provided with funds when their legal structure is established and will then be used to support projects.
A total of some EUR 12.6 billion of financial instruments were created in 25 Member States.
Our recommendations The Court recommends the Commission: ο The Commission should require the Member States, in their administrative declarations, to clearly confirm the effectiveness of the primary checks carried out by the managing authority and the certifying authority. ο The Commission should, in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Regulation, carry out a detailed assessment of the problem of primary checks carried out by the authorities in the Member States during the 2007-2013 programming period. ο The Commission should examine the causes of irregularities in EU State aid rules. ο The Commission should limit persistent delays in the payment of EU funds through financial instruments.
Full information on the audit of EU expenditure in the field of regional policy, transport and energy by the Court can be found in Chapter 5 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
More information on income and expenditure Employment and social affairs EUR 16.2 billion As part of our audit 26, the audit concerned expenditure on employment and social expenditure, which is part of the EU's cohesion policy.
The main objectives of expenditure in this area are to combat unemployment, to develop human resources and to promote labour market integration.
Employment and social policy is primarily implemented through the European Social Fund (ESF): 98% of payments made in 2013 in this area of expenditure.
The ESF supports investment in human capital in the form of training and other employment activities.
At a private school in Portugal, the full remuneration of the school principal was related to the EU project, although it was related to other tasks.
Moreover, the ceiling for co-financing salaries has not been taken into account.
The Court reached similar findings in the case of projects carried out in Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.
In the event of a significant number of errors, the authorities of the Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct the error before submitting a request to the Commission.
If this information had been used to correct errors before reporting to the Commission, the estimated error rate in this respect would have been 1.8%.
More information on revenue and expenditure areas 27 In response to the Court's recommendation and in order to reduce the likelihood of errors and administrative burdens on project promoters, the use of lump sums and lump sums was extended in 2009 instead of reimbursement of actual costs.
During the audit carried out in 2013, the Court did not detect any errors of quantification in the application of lump sums and lump sums.
This means that projects whose costs are reported using such payment options are less defective.
Our recommendations The Court recommends the Commission: ο The Commission should ask the Member States to strengthen the control of public procurement rules, non-project costs or projects of value not exceeding the EU added value. ο The Commission should ensure that Member States address the problem that staff costs in EU projects are higher than for projects financed by national funds. ο The Commission should ensure that Member States take into account all the simplification possibilities provided for in the European Structural and Investment Funds Regulations for 2014-2020.
For full information on the audit of EU expenditure in the field of employment and social affairs carried out by the Court, see Chapter 6 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
28 This expenditure area covers expenditure on external relations, development and humanitarian aid and actions for candidate and candidate countries.
Development projects are scattered in over 150 countries around the world and their size and experience vary in size and experience.
Support for projects financed by EU funds shall be subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in specific financial agreements and to compliance with other rules, such as tendering procedures and public procurement procedures.
Expenditure shall be managed directly by the Commission Directorate-General by the Commission's central services in Brussels or the EU Delegations in beneficiary countries in beneficiary countries or jointly with international organisations.
Thus Estimated error rate: 2.6 % (2012): 3.3%) Audit systems examined: conditionally effective Most errors concerned ineligible expenditure incurred at the level of final beneficiaries, such as expenditure incurred outside the eligibility period, the inclusion of ineligible expenditure in project expenditure (e.g. VAT, unjustified staff costs and general costs) and undocumented expenditure.
The Commission approved pre-accession expenditure of a total of EUR 150 million, although it was not confirmed by evidence that these expenditures had been incurred and qualified.
The amounts validated were based on the estimates of the mission's own and not on the costs incurred, paid and accepted on which the relevant evidence was based.
After the Court has detected this systematic error, the Commission has corrected these operations in the accounts.
Example: Unrealised expenditure The Commission has signed an agreement on EUR 9.5 million with the UN Development Programme for Social Development in Moldova.
In 2013, the Commission adopted cost recovery agreements worth EUR 1,8 million for which the cost underlying has not yet been incurred.
More information on revenue and expenditure areas 29 The Commission's Directorate-General for EuropeAid manages the majority of EU expenditure on external actions under the budget.
EuropeAid systems analysed are assessed as partially effective.
EuropeAid adopted an action plan in May 2013 to address major shortcomings.
Our recommendations The Court recommends the Commission: ο The Commission should ensure that employee instructions reflect that the final management of expenditure should be based solely on actual expenditure and not on its own estimates.
The Commission has already agreed to make appropriate changes to its final clearance of expenditure procedure.
Full information on the audit of EU expenditure in the field of external relations, external assistance and enlargement by the Court can be found in Chapter 7 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
30 The main component of this expenditure area is research and innovation projects, which accounted for EUR 7.7 billion of payments in 2013.
Other internal policies include expenditure on a number of policy objectives, including education and culture, security, migration and action to address the effects of the financial crisis.
Most expenditure is directly managed by the Commission.
Yes Estimated error rate: 4.6 % (2012): 3.9 %) Audit systems examined: Effective In most payments in this expenditure area, the Commission reimburses the costs incurred by grant beneficiaries in project cost statements.
Errors arise when securators report ineligible costs which the control systems do not detect before reimbursement by the Commission.
35% of the estimated error rate is due to incorrect or ineligible staff costs.
To this end, consideration should be given, inter alia, to the estimated staff costs, not to the actual staff costs, as well as to the working time which was not allocated to the project.
In addition to non-compliance with expenditure rules, reimbursement of ineligible costs is also difficult to achieve effectively the policy objectives and therefore reduces the added value of EU funds (see example).
Example: Ineligible expenditure reduces the EU's added value provides support to ensure effective and effective controls at the EU's external borders.
The Court examined a project in Spain which consisted in purchasing four helicopters, which in 75% were intended to be used for surveillance and control of external borders.
However, the Court found that this objective represented only 25% of the working time of the helicopter.
Therefore, the EU should have paid only 25%, not 75% of the helicopter's actual cost.
More information on revenue and expenditure areas 31 Under the audit expenditure control system, the Commission monitors progress reports and statements of expenditure on funded projects before making payments.
The Court found that the Commission does not always apply the procedure in a uniform way, which could affect the effectiveness of the programmes and increase the administrative burden on beneficiaries.
Our recommendations The Court recommends the Commission: The Commission should provide the beneficiaries and the authorities of the Member States with timely, consistent and clear guidance on eligibility and control rules for new research programmes for 2014-2020 and other internal policies. The Commission should further focus its control activities on risks by focusing control activities on high risk beneficiaries (e.g. for less experienced entities, with regard to EU funding). The Commission should focus its control activities on less risk beneficiaries to a greater extent.

More information on revenue and expenditure areas 32 Administrative and related expenditure EUR 10.6 billion As part of our audit, administrative and related expenditure covers expenditure of EU institutions and other bodies.
This includes the Commission, Parliament, the European External Action Service (EEAS), the European Council and the Council of the European Union, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor.
Staff expenditure (staff, allowances and pensions) accounts for 60% of expenditure and the remainder of expenditure on buildings, equipment, energy, communication and information technology.
The results of the Court's audits in the agencies and other decentralised agencies of the European Union will be discussed in the special annual reports, including the summary reports.
Not Estimated error rate: 1,0% (2012): 0,0%) Tested control systems: Effective examination of most control systems revealed no serious deficiencies.
However, the Court notes that payments for salaries and allowances made by the Commission and the EEAS are repeated, as are weaknesses in the procurement procedures of the EU Delegations (under the EEAS).
Our recommendations The Court recommends: The Commission and the EEAS should take further steps to ensure that the parts of the personal files affecting the payment of salaries and allowances are up-to-date. The EEAS should support and direct EU delegations in the procurement procedures.
For full information on the audit of administrative expenditure and related expenditure by the Court, see Chapter 9 of the annual report on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2013.
More information on revenue and expenditure under the European Development Fund (EDF) €2.6 billion Under the European Development Fund (EDF) 33 Under the EDF, the European Union provides funds for development cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and with overseas countries and regions (OCTs).
In addition, the objective is to promote sustainable development and the integration of ACP and OCT countries into the world economy.
The EDFs are financed by Member States which are covered by a separate Financial Regulation and managed by the European Commission outside the general budget of the EU.
The environment in which external assistance financed by the EFF is implemented is at large at risk, in particular in view of the fact that the actions are largely geographically dispersed and that the partner countries do not have sufficient institutional and administrative capacity.
Our findings Reliability of the EDF accounts: the EDF's 2013 annual accounts contain significant errors in the assets and financial condition of the EDF, the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in net assets as a whole.
Not audited control systems: is there a significant risk of errors in relation to effective EDF commitments?
Thus estimated error rate: 3,4% (2012: 3,0%) Failure to comply with the procurement rules resulted in around half of the estimated error rate (see example).
Another important source of error is the lack of evidence to support expenditure.
For example, the Court examined the call for tenders for IT equipment for the business information centre, financed under the scheme for micro and small enterprises, for the beneficiary's failure to comply with the rules for the award of contracts by the beneficiary.
The study showed that the contract was not awarded to the lowest bidder, although the lowest price was the award criterion.
This error was not detected by the controller who carried out the programme's accounting check in accordance with the relevant framework agreement with the Commission.
For more information on revenue and expenditure areas of the 34th EDF, budgetary support shall also be granted where payments are made directly to the budget of the developing country, provided that specific conditions are met.
The Court found errors in the transactions related to budget support for which compliance with the conditions was wrongly assessed and the exchange rate was wrong in the case of the exchange of payments to the local currency.
The European Commission's Directorate-GeneralAid manages not only the majority of the EU budget's external assistance expenditure but also almost all expenditure from the European Development Fund (EDF).
EuropeAid systems are assessed as partially effective.
However, in May 2013, EuropeAid adopted an action plan to address the main shortcomings identified.

ADB001375DE04-12PP-CH058-12APCFIN-RAS-2011_ACER-TR.DOC 19.9.2012
Responsibility of the controller 6. Responsibility of the certificate of assurance of the Agency's accounts and of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions
7.Reports on control and control and control and international audit and professional behaviour requirements for IFAC and international standards for the highest control bodies INTOSAI.
In accordance with these standards, the Court is required to plan and carry out audits in such a way as to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the Agency's annual accounts are free from material false presentations and the underlying transactions are legal and regular.
8.The audit report shall include the execution of the audit activities in order to obtain the audit evidence in relation to the values and other information contained in the financial statements and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The selection of audit activities shall depend on the recognition of the auditor, including risk assessments, in respect of material, planned or unintended, erroneous presentations in the course of closure and material, planned or unintended infringements of European Union law in respect of the underlying transactions.
When assessing those risks, the controller shall take into account the internal control system which is competent to draw up and present the financial statements and the 5 supervisory and control systems established to ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, in order to plan the control activities appropriate to the circumstances in question.
The audit shall include an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting rules applied and the adequacy of the established accounting estimates and an assessment of the overall presentation of the accounts.
9.Hofista shall ensure that the evidence obtained is sufficient and adequate to serve as the basis for the following opinions.
The Court's opinion on the reliability of the accounts10 Following the Court's assessment, the Agency's accounts11 shall, in all material respects, present the Agency's financial and financial situation as at 31 December 2011 and the results of its operations and cash flows in the financial year ending on that date, in accordance with the financial rules and accounting rules adopted by the Commission's accounting officer12.

In addition, the payment rate was low compared to 41% of the commitments under Title II and Title III.
The high level of unused appropriations and transfers made and the low level of payments indicate shortcomings in the planning and implementation of the budget and the non-compliance with the principle of annuality.
Other comments 14. Transparency of recruitment procedures needs to be improved.
For example, no maximum number of candidates to be included in the reserve list or no information on the appeal is given in the recruitment notices.
7 written and oral examinations and their weight shall not be prepared before examination of applications.
15.In 2011, the Agency paid EUR 10 839 for daily allowances to seconded experts who were nationals of the country in which the Agency is established.
This payment infringes the provisions adopted by the Management Board of the Agency concerning the secondment of national experts under which only temporary staff who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are employed are entitled to daily subsistence allowances.

ACER - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ACER - Agence de coopération des régulateurs de l'énergie AGENCIES' RESPONSE 13. In the first year of ACER's activity, ACER had to employ a large part of its employees, which involved problems and caused the job vacancies to be filled with delay, which was clearly reflected in the utilisation rates of the Agency's budget.
They also affected the expected public procurement needs and led to the focus of the procurement procedures at the end of the year, which required significant transfers to meet the legal and budgetary commitments made.
As most of the posts were filled at the beginning of 2012, ACER is now in a much better position to carry out its tasks and to carry out its budget.
14. ACER takes note of the reasons for the Court's observations and has already taken corrective action.
15. ACER takes note of the powers of provisional determination and has already suspended the payment of daily allowances to Slovenian seconded national experts.

6 The general accounting rules adopted by the Commission in all material respects are appropriate.
10. The following observations do not undermine the Court's view on the audit.
COMMENTS ON BUDGET MANAGEMENT 11.The Agency has transferred EUR 1.9 million or 56% of the total budget allocated to Title II (the Agency's buildings and related costs) and is mainly related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
This is an operational activity, a multiannual activity, which should be completed under Title III of the budget.
12. In addition, the Agency has transferred EUR 3.1 million or 91% of the total appropriations allocated under Title III, including the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
The extremely high transfer rate in Title III results mainly from an increase of EUR 3 million in the amending budget approved on 31 October 2013.
OTHER COMMENTS 13.At the end of the year, the Agency had EUR 5.5 million of cash, of which approximately EUR 3 million of late ADB001936DE04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014 7 Amending Budget (see paragraph 12).
However, the average cash during the year was significantly higher than for operational needs.
The conduct of previous years of conduct of the 14th Annex I provides an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years; this report was adopted by the House IV chaired by Milan Martin CVIKL, a member of the Court of Auditors, at a meeting in Luxembourg on 8 July 2014.
For the Court of Auditors Vítor Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President ADB001936DE04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014
1 COMMENTS FROM THE Previous YEARS OF ANNEX I Annual remark of the Court Status of corrective actions (completed/completed/present/e.g.) 2011 High levels of unused appropriations and transfers made and low levels of payments indicate weaknesses in the planning and implementation of the budget and are in breach of the principle of annuality.
The transparency of recruitment procedures has to be improved in 2011.
In addition, questions concerning written and oral examinations and their weight were not developed before the examination of the applications.
The closure in 2012 in order to cover higher fees for education, the Agency shall grant a special allowance in addition to the education allowance provided for in the Staff Regulations1 to workers whose children attend primary or secondary education.
In 2012, the special allowances amounted to around EUR 23 000.
They are not covered by the Statute and are therefore incompatible with the rules.
Completed ADB001936DE04-14PP-CH068-14APCFIN-RAS-2013_ACER-TR.DOC 8.7.2014
1 2 year Court's observation The state of the corrective actions (completed/completed/completed) 2012 carried over the budgetary commitments of EUR 1,7 million in Title II (the Agency's buildings and associated costs) of its budget (equivalent to 81% of the total appropriations in Title II) to the following financial year.
These transfers are mainly linked to the ongoing implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
Since implementing measures form part of the Agency's operational activities, they should be entered in the budget in Title III.
It was completed in 2012. In 2012, the Agency made 20 budget transfers of around EUR 1 million, of which 43 budget lines.
At the end of 2012, the Agency had EUR 4.2 million of cash at the end of the year, including a budget surplus of EUR 1.6 million in 2011, resulting from an excessive recovery in 2011, which the Commission recovered in January 2013.
In 2012, the recruitment procedures audited showed shortcomings affecting the transparency and equal treatment of candidates: questions concerning oral and written examinations were not identified prior to the examination of applications.
The conditions for taking written and oral examinations and inclusion in the list of candidates were not sufficiently precise and insufficient measures were taken to ensure the anonymity of candidates participating in the written examinations.
Article 3 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations provides for a double basic allowance of EUR 252,81, i.e. EUR 505,62.

ACER - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - AGENCIES' REPLY 11. The Court found that these irregularities had already been corrected by the Agency for the subsequent commitment appropriations for the implementation of REMIT that were entered in the operational budget lines in Title III.
12. As the inspectors have already acknowledged, the high transmission rate was due to delays in the implementation of REMIT.
This delay was due to the approval of the transfer of the necessary additional funds from DG ENER only in October 2013 and to the receipt of funds by the Agency at the beginning of November 2013.
However, the Agency has successfully completed all planned procurement procedures by December 2013 for the implementation of REMIT, and expenditure will be incurred in 2014.
13. The end-of-year balance on the basis of the budgetary adjustment covered EUR 3 million received at the end of the year; the remaining amount was intended to cover all legal commitments, in particular in respect of REMIT, to which commitments were imposed at the end of 2013.
The cash forecasting tool introduced in 2014 will allow better money management in the future. ACER - DE

These measures were essentially linked to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation (€1.1 million), a multi-year operational experience in the integration and transparency of the wholesale energy market.
In addition, the Agency has transferred EUR 0,79 million and 35% respectively (EUR 0,98 million and 41% in 2014 respectively) of the appropriations for Title II (administrative expenditure) for the following financial year.
The Annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken on the basis of the Court's observations of the previous years.
This report was adopted by House IV under the direction of Mr Baudilio TOMIlio MUGURUZ, a member of the Court of Auditors, at a meeting in Luxembourg on 13 September 2016.

C 449/20 Official Journal of the European Union 1.12.2016 DE Court's comment The Agency of the Agency shall be EUR 157 million or 62 % of the appropriations allocated under Title III (operational expenditure) for the following financial year (2013: EUR 3,1 million or 91 %).
These measures were essentially related to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation, the complex multiannual operational regulation for which the Implementing Regulation was adopted only on 17 December 2014 (1).
In addition, the Agency transferred EUR 0.98 million and 41% (EUR 1.9 million and 56%) respectively for Title II (administrative expenditure) for the following financial year.
In October 2013, the Agency received an additional EUR 3 million in the amending budget for the implementation of the REMIT Regulation for 2014.
However, the provisions of the transposition Regulation shall apply only from October 2015.
Part of the appropriations was used in 2014 to prepare for the implementation of the REMIT Regulation.
At the end of 2014, the Agency made two pre-financing payments over EUR 1.56 million..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Although this allows the Agency to finance its potential REMIT activities, this approach is contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness.

Given the continuing uncertainty about the annual allocation of appropriations to the Agency, the principle of honesty is difficult to reconcile with the inevitable multi-annual nature of the REMIT project.

16. The following observations do not undermine the Court's view.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 17. In its May 2016 evaluation report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) highlighted the urgent need to clarify the roles and responsibilities and to analyse the workload of the contracting entity in order to increase the efficiency of processes and procedures.
The IAS also concluded that the planning and monitoring of public procurement should be significantly improved.
The Agency and IAS have agreed on a corrective action plan.
The Agency has allocated EUR 4.9 million and 86% of the appropriations entered in Title III (operational expenditure) for the following financial year (EUR 1.4 million and EUR 59% respectively in 2015).
As in previous years, in connection with the implementation of the REMIT Regulation on the integration and transparency of the wholesale energy market ((7), in 2016, these measures amounted to EUR 4.7 million (EUR 1.1 million in 2015).
In Title II (Administration expenditure) in Title II (Administration) respectively, the Agency transferred EUR 1 million and 38% of the appropriations (EUR 0,8 million and 35% respectively) to the following financial year.
19. The increase in financial resources is worrying and is contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness.
The efficiency factor is directly linked to the conclusion or signature of procurement and procurement procedures at the end of the year, leading to the transfer of supplies and/or payments to the following year.
In 2016, 98 of 299 Vertragen were signed in November and December (EUR 5 976 122,47, i.e. 40% of the total value of Vertragge closed in 2016).
The Agency may decide to introduce separate budgetary measures to better reflect the multifaceted nature of contracts, contracts, supplies and payments, and the inevitable discrepancies between contracts, supplies and payments.

6.12.2017 Official Journal of the European Union C 417/29 EN Court's observations Gem.§ The agreement between the Agency and the Government of Slovenia is intended to establish a European school in Slovenia, but this is still not the case within four years of the conclusion of the agreement.
The Agency has transferred EUR 1.36 million and 59% of the appropriations allocated to Title III (operational expenditure) respectively to the following financial year (EUR 1.57 million and 62% respectively in 2014).
These measures were essentially linked to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation (€1.1 million), the complexity of the multiannual operational effectiveness with regard to the integration and transparency of the wholesale energy market.
In addition, the Agency has transferred EUR 0,79 million and 35% respectively (EUR 0,98 million and 41% in 2014 respectively) of the appropriations for Title II (administrative expenditure) for the following financial year.
Year 2014 ANNEX Follow-up to previous years' comments (completed/completed/completed/completed)
DE C 417/30 Official Journal of the European Union 6.12.2017 of the AGENCY's replies 18. The Agency has successfully implemented the measures in accordance with the IAS.
Of the six recommendations, two very important and three important recommendations have already been adopted.
The Agency plans to withdraw the last recommendation by October 2017.
19. The Agency notes that, due to the multi-annual investments related to the REMIT Regulation, the funds to be transferred are high and are difficult to reconcile with the principle of budgetary fairness.
The high revenue results from the schedule of the annual contractual cycle established in 2013, when the Agency received additional budget appropriations from the REMIT project at the end of the year.
However, it should be noted that the commitment was implemented at 100% for the financial year 2016 under the F chapter for REMIT expenditure.
The Agency will examine the implementation of the separate budgetary measures for Title III.
20. The Agency considers that the introduction of separate measures in Title III better reflects the sensitivity of some of its capabilities, in particular in the REMIT area, provided that the funds made available to the Agency are stable and predictable.

2. The Court examined the accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year ending 31 December 1995.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 (OJ L 18 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76)
15), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Management Board.
In accordance with Articles 65, 61 and 68 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93, he is also responsible for drawing up and submitting financial statements in accordance with financial rules.
The Court of Auditors shall be required to audit these accounts in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
4. At its meeting on 29 October 1993, the European Council decided to transfer the seat of Cedefop from Berlin to Thessaloniki.
In order to facilitate this removal, certain changes have been made to the conditions of employment of the staff, which, in part, did not comply with the regulations in force.
The exact circumstances are described in point 46 of the 66.
In addition, a number of other cases were identified where payments were not fully in line with the regulations in force.
(5) On the basis of the audit carried out, the Court can with reasonable certainty conclude that the accounts for point 10 11 12 are reliable for the financial year ending 31 December 1995, in so far as they correctly reflect the revenue and expenditure of 1995 and the financial situation at the end of the year.
In addition to the important exception to the expenditure referred to in the preceding paragraph, the underlying transactions were, in general, legal and regular.
CONTROL COMMENTS General context 6 The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 {l) as a European Community satellite body and aims to promote vocational education and training at Community level.
Cedefop started work in Berlin in 1976 and moved to Thessaloniki in 1995.
7. As defined in that Regulation, the Centre should assist the Commission in promoting and promoting vocational and continuing education and training, at Community level, in contributing to the common vocational education and training policy, and in particular in promoting the exchange of information and experience."
In the field of vocational education and training, the Centre shall be responsible in particular for preparing documentation, contributing to the further development and coordination of research, providing appropriate documentation and information, supporting and supporting initiatives to achieve a coordinated solution (in particular in relation to the approximation of levels of education and mutual recognition of certificates) and providing a meeting place with interested parties." 8. The Centre shall be managed by a management board of 48 members (in 1995 costs of ECU 334 000 were incurred); Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75, which was published on 13 February 1975, OJ L 334, 13.7.1975;
The Management Board shall elect a Chairperson and three Vice-Chairs from among its members for a period of one year.
At the time of the audit (May 1996), the President of the Council was the CEO of DG XXII for Education, Training and Youth.
The Director of the Centre shall be appointed by the Commission on the basis of a list of candidates submitted by the Governing Board.
9. In accordance with the basic Regulation, the Director shall be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Centre, while the Management Board shall have overall responsibility.
The Management Board shall adopt decisions, adopt a work programme and an annual report, draw up the revenue and annual accounts of expenditure for the previous year and an estimate of revenue and expenditure for the coming year.
10. In accordance with the basic Regulation, the Commission's role as representatives of DG XXI I is not only to represent the members of the Commission in the Governing Board, but also to adopt the work programme, to assess the report on the review and statement of revenue and expenditure, and to report the estimates of revenue and expenditure to the Council and the European Parliament.
In accordance with Article 23 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93* of 30 June 1993, any commitments and payments made by the Centre before payment must be: (a) the corresponding costs and benefits... (b) the efficient use of human resources and human resources; (c) quality products corresponding to the needs of Cedefop customers; (d) a clear and coherent role in the European Community's vocational education and training policy.
Financial data 14. For the financial year 1995 the Centre had funds of ECU 16.50 million.
These commitments led to a payment of ECU 10,11 million and a transfer of funds to the 1996 budget year of ECU 4,67 million, the remaining amount being cancelled of ECU 1,72 million.
ECU 2.16 million were paid out of the appropriations carried over from the previous year and ECU 0.29 million were cancelled.
Annex 1 to this report shall include an analysis of the use of appropriations from the financial year and of appropriations carried over from the financial year 1994.
Annex 2 sets out the accounts for the financial year 1995 and the balance sheet of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 1995.
Comments on the implementation of the budget Separation of actions 15. Following the move to Thessaloniki, the Zenjum has not yet established appropriate procedures for the allocation of the duties of authorising officer, accounting officer and authorising officer.
For example, for example, an accounting officer took control of an advance administrator.
Payment agency 16. The share of payments made without the consent of the financial controller remains high (60% in 1995 without remuneration).
The strong use of the pre-financing scheme is not in line with the spirit of the financial rules.
A more acceptable practice would be to eliminate small current expenditure and expenditure through the paying agency, where the risk of irregularities is relatively low.
Transfers under the budget 17. Transfers under the various budget lines in 1995 amounted to ECU 922 000, i.e. 5.6% of the original budget compared to 10.9% in 1994.
During the last two months of 1995, a transfer of 33% was made in 1994 in the last two months.
18. The Centre did not carry out any crossings between different titles in 1995.
The observations submitted by the Court last year (2) were therefore taken into account.
19. The large quota transfer practice that took place in previous years [3] continued to increase in 1995;
In 1995 only 61% of the funds finally available were paid out compared to 73% in 1994.
The share of commitments carried over to 1996 was 28% (compared to 23% in 1994).
The proportion of funds lost was 10% compared to 5% in 1994.
Table 1 shows the breakdown of appropriations carried over from the original 1995 budget and their subsequent use by title.
20. Transfers in the area of operational expenditure amounted to 53% of the original appropriations compared to 40% in 1994.
Since 8 percent of the operating expenditure was lost, this means that in 1995 the Centre paid only 39 percent of its operating budget for 1995.
At the end of the first quarter of 1996 only 34% of the appropriations carried over from 1995 under Title 3 were paid.
21. The significant number of transfers in the budget and cancelled appropriations and the large number of transfers in the budget for the financial year in question indicate that the work programme has not been implemented in accordance with the plan and that the principles of budgetary management have been infringed.
This fact and the lack of human resources (see paragraph 42...45) will have a serious impact on the implementation of the budget in 1996.
Whereas the subsidy for the general budget of the Communities for the financial year 1995 was paid by the Commission in several instalments; whereas the first tranche of ECU 2 300 000 was paid on 6 February 1995, followed by successive instalments of ECU 2 400 000 on 20 April 1995, of ECU 2 500 000 on 28 June 1995, of ECU 2 800 000 on 5 October 1995, of ECU 5 875 000 on 22 November 1995 and of ECU 525 000 on 1 December 1995;
As in previous years (4), this payment schedule is not compatible (2) The Court's Annual Report for the financial year 1994.
(3) The Court's annual reports for the financial years 1992, 1993, together with Article 26 of the Centre's financial rules, which provide for payments to be made during the first half of each quarter and to be adapted to the actual needs.
Expenditure 23. After the decision to transfer the Centre to Thessaloniki, a new Deputy Director was appointed in 1994 who was living and working in Thessaloniki at the time.
The worker moved to Berlin and received development aid of twice the basic salary. Less than a year later, after moving to Thessaloniki, the same worker received development aid of twice the basic salary.
Since the transfer of the centre took place quickly, the stay of the operator in Berlin was short (11 months) and part of the period was spent in Thessaloniki and received full daily allowances (including weekends) and the Court considered that these decisions were not in line with the principle of sound financial management and were not in line with the principle of sound financial management and were contrary to the principle of Cedefop.
24. The agreement of another Deputy Director, which moved from Berlin to Madrid in July 1995, was signed by the Governing Board with effect from 3 January 1995.
As a result, the worker received a payment of ECU 71 030.
The Court considers that the decision of the Management Board was not in line with the principles of economic governance.
25. In accordance with Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 of 30 June 1993, the contract may be awarded by hand, provided that the amount of the contract does not exceed ECU 12 000.
I n n n at least 12 cases have been allocated in amounts exceeding ECU 12 000 without complying with the tendering procedure referred to in Article 45 of that Regulation.
26. Almost 40% of the budget commitments under the budget line for the financial year 1995 (ECU 300,000) in the last two months of 1995 have been implemented in the framework of pilot studies and projects.
The amount of ECU 150 572 was allocated to the remuneration of the expert who started working at Cedefop on 1 February 1.996 and to another expert whose contract was signed on 22 December 1995.
These measures have been used too long to prevent the loss of funds.
27. The rental of Cedefop's temporary premises for January 1996 (ECU 22 750) has already been included in the 1995 revenue and expenditure account.
Since these expenditures relate to the 1996 financial year, they should also be entered in 1996 and 1994.
The Court urges the Centre to draw up the current list as soon as possible, as required by Article 52 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 of 1 June 1976, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 of 30 June 1993.
29. The balance sheet shall show, in respect of outstanding claims of the previous financial year, an amount of ECU 3 134 in respect of the invoice issued in 1991.
The Court's observations [5] were not taken into account, although the Centre's response provided adequate assurances.
The Court recommends that the Centre write off this amount unless there is reason to believe that this amount will be recovered •.
30. At the end of the year the Centre had financial resources of ECU 5.9 million.
The Centre is therefore responsible for managing large financial resources, although it has little expertise in this field.
The Court reiterates its observation last year [6] in which it concludes that this situation should be avoided by aligning the Centre with the actual financial needs of the Commission with that of the quarterly financial collection; the Commission should at the same time ensure that the Centre receives a realistic liquidity perspective before making payments;
Transfer of the Centre to Thessaloniki General comments ^B 31. At the European Council meeting of 29 October 1993, the decision was taken to transfer the seat of Cedefop from Berlin to Thessaloniki in Greece (7).
32. The actual transfer to Thessaloniki took place in August 1995 and in September 1995 the Centre started to operate in Greece.
The Court calculated that the 1995 financial account included around ECU 3 300 000 for removal expenses.
33. Since 1 September 1995, the centre has been located in the Thessaloniki Institute of Agriculture and Industry.
From 1 September 1999 at the latest, the Greek State shall provide the Centre with a permanent accommodation building.
The Centre has signed four agreements- (i) the Court's annual report for the financial year 1994.
(6) The Court's Annual Report for the financial year 1994.
(7) Council Decision 93/C 323/01 of 29 October 1993, OJ C 323, 30.11.1993, p. 1, concerning the rental of temporary premises and the construction of a permanent accommodation building.
The basic agreement between Cedefop and the Greek State was signed in Thessaloniki on 22 June 1995.
The remaining three agreements, including the agreement between the Greek State and the organisation responsible for the whole construction, form part of the basic agreement.
For temporary accommodation 34. For the temporary building of the Centre one must pay an annual rent of ECU 273 000, payable directly to the owner.
35. In accordance with Article 1 of the Agreement between the Greek State and the Centre, the Greek State shall, from 1 September 1995, make the building and all its installations available to Cedefop.
The Greek authorities are responsible for electrical and electronic cable connections and for telephone calls.
36. At the time of the transfer of the Centre's building, it expressed no reservations in writing.
However, during the first four months in Thessaloniki (September - December 1995), the centre had to invest ECU 120 000 in order to develop the building using temporary premises.
Among other things, electronic and electrical cable connections and telephone connections had to be moved.
37. These investments were fully covered by the Centre and were presented in the 1995 accounts.
The agreements do not provide a clear indication of who is to take over these investments.
Final accommodation 38. The Greek State shall be obliged to make the Centre available to final accommodation by 1 September 1999.'
Cedefop will pay the Greek State the total amount of ECU 6 879 750 for the construction of the building in four equal tranches of ECU 1 719 937.
For the first three tranches, the payment dates were set at 1 September 1995, 1 September 1996 and 1 September 1997.
The last tranche shall be paid at the time of the final transfer of the building.
39. The Centre has not ensured that these payments are linked to the real progress of construction works.
The Centre has already paid over two years before the transfer of the building the amount of ECU 5 159 811.
40. The Court recommends that the Centre ensure that interest is used for the first tranche for the benefit of V orbein.
The Centre should ensure that the Centre is responsible for the overall performance of the work carried out by Cedefop;
Staff: General comments 42. The 1995 Employment Plan provides for 79 posts, including 24À,11LA,15B,26Cund3D.At the time check point (May 1996) 37 people actually worked for Cedefop (14 A, 7 B, 14 C and 2 D), 11 people were taken over by other EU institutions, 14 people left the Centre before moving to Thessaloniki and 17 people were taken over to Berlin.
In 1995 and 1996, many new workers were already employed and this will continue in 1996.
43. 17 people staying in Berlin may work in public and private institutions or in other EU institutions or in other EU institutions, depending on the age of the service in Cedefop and depending on the age of the service (each year of service corresponds to the monthly salary and the minimum service period is 6 months).
At the end of that period, interested parties may move to Thessaloniki or find another solution.
This situation leads, inter alia, to the fact that Cedefop cannot fill 17 posts (May 1996) because they are blocked in the budget and cannot be filled, because the persons concerned may later start to go to Thessaloniki.
44. It is unclear what will happen to those of this group of 17 people who do not want to move to Thessaloniki after a fixed period of stay in Berlin.
Article 20 of the Staff Regulations provides that the official must, at his place of employment or at such a distance from that place, from his place of residence or place of employment, in order to ensure that he is not disabled in the performance of his duties."
In any case, three cases have been brought before the Court of Justice of the EU of workers who were not ready to move to Thessaloniki.
45. This situation, in which 17 important budget posts are blocked by workers who are currently not working for Cedefop, had a significant impact on the work of the Centre in 1995 and will have an impact on the years 1996 and 1997.
Staff: Amendment of the status of 46. I n Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 of 10 February 1975 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995 provides that: The staff of the Centre shall be subject to the rules and rules applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities.
The Centre shall exercise the powers conferred on the appointing authority in respect of its staff.
The Management Board of the Centre shall, after consulting the Commission, adopt the relevant implementing rules.';
Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 also repeals Council Regulation (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) No 1859/76 of 29 June 1976 laying down the conditions of employment of the staff of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training.
This amendment was necessary to ensure the consistency of the management of the staff of decentralised institutions (...) at Community level" (8).
While the Centre's staff have been appointed officials, the staff of other decentralised institutions are temporary staff.
47. The Court examined the changes in the conditions of employment and other arrangements between the Management Board and staff in order to detect a number of irregularities and in the Court's view the most serious irregularities are described in paragraphs 49 and 66.
48. The Administrative Board has not provided such findings to the financial controller for the purpose of issuing an opinion.
However, all the obligations under these contracts have been settled under the advance payment procedure and have been subsequently approved by the financial controller.
The appointment of staff as temporary staff of 49th of March 1995 (Article 2 (b) of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities) in the same grade and age group as the temporary staff in the first stage of the year 1995 was appointed (Article 2 (b) of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities) in the same grade and in the same age group as the temporary staff. In the second stage, these staff were recruited as EU staff from 1 April 1995 on the basis of an internal selection procedure, which was subsequently classified on the basis of documents.
The breach of the Staff Regulations following the appointment on 1 March 1995 of former contract staff of Cedefop on 1 March 1995 following the appointment of contract staff of Cedefop as temporary staff of any of the contract staff of Cedefop should not be considered as a higher level of employment than level 3 (or level 4 in grade A 1 (8) Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 establishing Cedefop, fourth recital.
H y h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
51. However, 33 of 59 temporary staff were classified as staff of a higher level than level 3.
On 1 March 1995, the Centre published 15 interlinked calls for proposals and calls for participation in internal competitions.
In accordance with the Staff Regulations, the aim of the selection procedure is to organise a competition between a large number of candidates to fill the vacancy of the most qualified candidate (Article 27 (1) of the Staff Regulations).
Therefore, by definition, selection by definition entails a competitive situation and a risk of non-recognition (10).
As a result, nomination decisions should be considered unlawful (n) following a selection procedure involving abuse of discretion (n).
56. The Commission's legal services reached the same conclusion as was confirmed by the memo dated 4 January 1995, (c) (12).
57. Since the selection procedures had a different purpose than those laid down in the Staff Regulations, the selection procedures carried out by Cedefop were discretionary and should therefore be considered unlawful.
In accordance with Article 31 of the Staff Regulations, Cedefop's staff should be appointed as officials from 1 April 1995 as follows:... officials of category A or special language service (LA): in grade (i.e. A 7 or LA 7) (Article 31 (1));... officials of other categories (Article 31 (1));... officials of grade (A) in grade (A 7 or LA 7) (Article 3 or C 5, D 3 or D 4) (Article 31, paragraph 2); in grade which corresponds to grade (i.e. Β 1, Β 3 or Β 5; C 1, C 5, D 3 or D 4) (Article 31, paragraph 2);... up to half of the appointment may be appointed as staff members in the grade of the nearest grade;
59. Contrary to the provisions of the Staff Regulations, 32 of 43 staff of a grade higher than that of a group.
(10) Judgment of 29 September 1976 in Case 105/75 GI UFFRI DA v RAT, ECR S. 1395. (n) Judgment in Case GI UFFRI DA, see above.
(12) By definition, the selection procedure involves a risk of non-compliance and there are clear legal grounds for maintaining this margin of risk.
(13) Of the 17 staff employed in category A 13 were appointed to a higher grade than A 7 (the rules provide for a limitation to six appointments); of the 18 staff employed at a higher grade than in the receiving group (the rules provide for six nominations); of the three staff in category D were appointed at a higher grade than in the receiving group (the rules do not provide for such a possibility); ^ 54. During the selection of Cedefop in 15 cases, a completely different objective was pursued.
failure to comply with the obligations relating to the probationary period 60. Prior to the appointment of a staff member as a life official, the staff member must successfully have a probationary period (Article 34 of the Staff Regulations); therefore, the probationary period must be subject to an objective ex post evaluation of the staff member;
61. Contrary to the provisions of the Staff Regulations, officials have been informed in advance of their final appointment. The probationary period has been clearly defined as the necessary legal formality," which, in fact, should not be considered as a conditional test (paragraph 4.1 of the Framework Agreement); a letter of 7 February 1995 addressed to officials for a trial, the second paragraph and the first paragraph of point (f) of the Annex: The probationary period is a legal formality which must be considered a probationary formality by each official); · the unauthorised secondment of officials for a trial period of 62. According to Article 38 of the Staff Regulations, only officials for life may be seconded to other institutions, i.e. officials who have successfully completed the probation period.
65. This means that a system has been established in which up to 50% of the remuneration of workers in the currency to which the higher adjustment rate applies (i.e. the adjustment rate applicable to Germany of 111.4 %) has been transferred to Thessaloniki (in the case of Greece the adjustment rate is 80.2 %).
The Commission has committed itself to introduce specific rules on mobility to the Centre.
These provisions are contrary to the principle of equal treatment of all officials.
Whereas Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 251/95 of 6 February 1995 makes it clear that the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants apply to the staff of the Centre;
This means that all the provisions of this Article shall apply to the staff of the Centre, including Article 29 (1) (c), to the acquisition of officials by other institutions.
Therefore, there is no justification for special treatment for mobility; a summary on mobility in case 67. The Court's audit has shown that the Centre's work programme has not been implemented in line with the plan due to significant staff shortages.
As a result, significant transfers were made and measures were cancelled.
The audit also showed that effective administrative and accounting procedures have not yet been put in place.
68. Two alternate directors received a salary corresponding to the basic salary for four months; these payments and a payment of ECU 71 030 to one of the alternate directors were not in line with the principles of sound financial management and with the interests of the Centre.
69. During the Court's audit, there were 79 approved posts, but only 37 people actually worked at the Centre.
17 staff were appointed to EU officials although they were not going to move to Thessaloniki or were transferred to another Community institution.
Conclusion 71.It is understandable that the move to Thessaloniki has made efforts to maintain staff in the EU institutions and to reduce the complex problems of moving to Thessaloniki.
However, the problem is that the regulatory framework, "in which the move was carried out, was not in line with the proper treatment of high-age workers and did not allow the smooth transfer of Cedefop without giving up its activities.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 21 November 1996.

The Management Board will proceed in accordance with the breakdown of the Court of Auditors' observations and conclusions.
3. The Administrative Board has reasonable expectations that all decentralised institutions and bodies will be treated in a similar manner and based on the same technical standards and practices that ensure equal treatment.
4. The Management Board considers that there is no reference to the basic facts that could be summarised as follows: the decision of the European Council of 29 October 1993 was taken without prior assessment of the effects of the transfer.
At his first meeting with the staff, he expressed his firm willingness to move with effect from 1 September 1995, with a schedule that CEDEFOP had implemented despite the problems of moving the centre....................................................................-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 18 November 1994, the members of the Commission adopted the President and Vice-Chairs of the Management Board of CEDEFOP.
The President asked the Commission to develop accompanying measures, especially for those workers who were unable to leave Berlin.
In the light of the regulations in force, the Commissioners considered that they were willing to examine the specific problems of some workers in a positive and pragmatic spirit.
At its meeting of 8 and 9 December 1994, the Administrative Council was unable to take a decision on the date of the transfer, as it seems unacceptable that workers who could not move to Thessaloniki could move to Thessaloniki without simply releasing the modern social plan.
At the same meeting, the Board of Directors instructed the Director to prepare an administrative decision (to be taken at an extraordinary meeting on 27 January 1995) aimed at transferring the Centre in a socially compatible manner on 1 September. " in the second half of 1994 the Council began an analysis of the Commission's proposal to amend Article 13 of the Regulation applicable to CEDEFOP, which provided that the Centre's staff would be subject to the rules and rules applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities.
The Director accepted this amendment as the basis for the Framework Agreement on accompanying measures for the transfer of CEDEFOP to Thessaloniki.
A framework agreement with staff was signed on 23 January 1995.
The preparations were carried out in close cooperation with the European Commission, which has proved to be very helpful throughout the transition period (1994 in 1996).
H y h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
Under the framework agreement, workers who could not leave Berlin decided to make available to other EU institutions or public/private organisations and to obtain remuneration from the Centre for a period of at least six months, with a monthly remuneration being paid for each period of work started.
The principle of payment of monthly salaries for each year of service is largely in line with social plans and usual practices in Germany and neighbouring countries in 1995 for 17 employees (age over 55 years of age over 10 years of service and over 50 years of age over 15 years of service).
These measures were not part of the Framework Agreement and were not finally proposed by the Commission by the Council of Ministers Decision of 17 November 1995 on the dismissal of officials following the accession of the new Member States only of officials of the European Parliament.
In its opinions on point 46 to 66, the Administrative Board will provide more detailed answers.
In general, it should be stressed that political issues should be taken seriously and ex post criticism avoided.
The transfer of a complete Community body within a restrictive framework of a large number of regulations and due to a large number of social and individual problems is in fact unique in the history of the Community.
5. The Governing Board shall return in response to the exception referred to in the last sentence.
8. The costs of the meetings of the Management Board in 1995 are due to the need to hold two additional meetings (January and June) in connection with the transfer.
In addition, as a result of the official start of business in Greece, in December 1995, a meeting was held which led to an increase in costs.
Only two meetings are planned in 1996.
13. The Management Board regrets that the Court has not responded to the decision of the European Parliament to postpone discharge in respect of the implementation of the 1994 budget.
This is serious because, in the light of the Court of Auditors' report for 1994 and the Council's recommendation on discharge, the discharge for 1994 should be considered and considered to be in line with ordinary rules and practices; in view of the fact that the evaluation of the financial year 1995 by the European Parliament, without the Court of Auditors' report for 1995, on which the Management Board could comment, should lead to the confusion of very different situations; the Centre was transferred to Greece in 1995.
The transfer was smooth and in acceptable conditions.
This transfer requires a transitional period which can only be completed in 1997 due to distortions to which workers have been exposed.
15. In this respect, significant improvements should be noted.
At the beginning of Thessaloniki, the workers helped each other to do their job.
16. As already mentioned last year, the increased use of the pre-financing scheme was increased at the request of the financial controller, which supported the cost-benefit indicator which caused high and delayed payments under the previous scheme.
As a result, the financial controller had to act more frequently.
The use of the paying agencies procedure for all expenditure that may require temporary budgetary commitments has reduced administrative costs and prevented delays.
The situation is even more difficult due to the conditions of payment in Greece (most payments are made in cash or in cheque).
The accounts on which bank connections are exchanged are rare and the contractors themselves collect their debts.
The geographical distance from the financial controller and the lack of reliability of the postal delivery should also be taken into account.
Furthermore, due to the delivery costs of DHL for the consignment (3 000 BFR per consignment) can only be made once a week.
The amendment to the decision establishing the pre-financing procedure will soon be submitted to the Management Board to better take account of the wishes of the Court of Auditors.
17. Transfers over the last two months have resulted from the need to make optimal use of the budget (from which ECU 2000 was postponed and released only before the Centre was transferred to Thessaloniki) and from the decision of the Administrative Board (7./8.12.1995) to recruit national experts seconded in accordance with the Commission's recommendations (also in order to speed up the Centre's work).
19. The Management Board was aware that in 1995 and 1996 it would be years of transition and renewal.
Some capacity losses are inevitable in the case of this international transfer, which, in the opinion of the Management Board, has been carried out in an acceptable and efficient manner.
The Centre is still facing problems arising from the transition period.
20. As the transfer of the centre took place with a very limited number of employees, the work of the administration and all other services slowed down.
For this reason, an application for non-automatic transfer of funds was submitted and approved.
The Administrative Board shall state that the Commission shall make all possible efforts to comply with Article 26 of the Financial Regulations concerning the Centre and the payment of grants according to actual needs during the first two weeks of the quarter.
There was an improvement in 1995 compared to 1994.
Long internal procedures (in which the issuing authority, the financial controller and the accounting officer participate) and the length of the transfer procedure by the bank do not, however, fully avoid the delay of the period (on average 12 days in 1995).
However, almost three payments would be made in 1995 in accordance with Article 26, as they were made at the centre within four days of the end of the first two weeks of the quarter.
If for all payments (from 9 to 22 days) the processing period would correspond to the average 12-day period, all payments would be made in accordance with Article 26 of the Financial Regulation.
The first payment was not in line with the rules, but the payment must be preceded by a budgetary commitment which takes some time.
23. The Deputy Director moved from Thessaloniki to Berlin due to a lack of certainty as to the actual date of the transfer of the centre.
At the time of appointment (1 October 1994) the date of removal had not yet been decided (which could have been postponed).
He hoped that his stay would be short, but his final period was still unknown.
For normal family reasons, he moved to Berlin under status conditions.
daily travel allowances have been granted in accordance with the same procedure as for other staff;
As regards the second development aid, the Deputy Director reimbursed the amount of the Centre after the audit, although he had the full right to receive the aid.
24. At its meeting in June 1995, the Administrative Board announced its agreement on 31 December 1995 and instructed the Director to implement this Decision and to implement the payments in accordance with the Staff Regulations.
The Management Board was pleased that the Deputy Director was ready to participate in the implementation of the work programme in 1995 and to assist the Centre in re-starting its activities in Thessaloniki.
The compensation (payment of one third of the basic salary from the date on which the obligation to provide the service expired until the date of termination of the contract) was in line with its contract and Article 47 of the BBSB.
25. In view of the difficulties of the initial phase and the large number of new contracts, the Centre was not able in any case to carry out normal tendering procedures.
For long-term contracts, tendering procedures are currently under way or are planned for 1996.
In addition, in order to ensure sustainable financial management in the course of the year, the Management Board would prefer to adopt a work programme in order to allow the services to have the time needed for calls for tenders and commitments, as well as for the relevant contracts to be concluded in the first months of the financial year.
26. 40% of the commitments to the pilot studies and projects budget line (ECU 300,000) have been implemented in the last months of the year, resulting from the late budget allocation of 1995 by the budgetary authority and from the transfer of the Centre to Thessaloniki.
The Centre had to operate logically and consistently, leaving it no other choice, since it had to meet its financial commitments under Titles I and II first, and only after leaving its budget commitments under Title III could it meet its financial commitments.
The Administrative Board at its December 1995 meeting granted the possibility of the secondment of national experts and could only be financed by deferred appropriations.
The Director had to act quickly and in a short time to prevent the disappearance of the funds that were available in the very late future.
The invitation of an expert (Austrian) (officially approved by the government) took place at the beginning of 1995.
27. The reason why the January 1996 rent was recorded in the 1995 accounts was purely practical.
According to the contract, the rent must be paid in advance in two instalments on 1 January and 1 July.
Since the first payment was made only in October 1995 and it would therefore be difficult to pay it again immediately on 1 January 1996, the first payment was made within a period of five months, including January 1996.
28. The update of the list is ongoing.
29. This will be fulfilled.
30. The Centre shall ensure that it provides realistic information to the Commission on the cash flow.
the last payment in the year should be the largest as it must also be intended to cover the first months of the following year in which larger payments are usually made;
31. See notes to point 4.32. The Centre's administration shall assess the costs of the transfer and the development of the situation in order to obtain a complete picture of the costs and benefits of the transfer to Greece.
13. 3.97 AND DE 1 ^ Official Journal of the European Communities C 81/15 36.-37.
As the Centre was expected to return to work as soon as it moved, additional investments and changes to V were needed.
As stated, the agreements do not contain a clear statement, because the centre requires more electrical connections and computer cables than it currently does.
Other investments concerned additional security and communication requirements such as "Europe by Satellite" for the direct reception of consignments through the institutions.
However, the Centre included questions concerning the temporary building on the agenda of the Steering Committee, which deals with the new and, if necessary, the temporary building.
The Administrative Board is aware that the content of the agreement on the new building has brought great responsibility to the Greek Government, which is now fulfilling this agreement.
Two issues raise particular concerns: ensuring a high quality building at a reasonable price; ensuring a timely completion of the building (until 1 September 1998) as far as possible.
The fact that significant payments have been made in advance (half of the building has already been paid, although the construction work has not yet started) can also have positive effects, as construction work (after selecting the construction plan and the construction company in October/November 1996) can quickly develop due to the immediate availability of the necessary funds.
Overall, the Management Board fully understood the Court's concerns, also shared by Members of the European Parliament, Mr Kellet-Bowmann and Mr Tappin, who visited the Centre on 1 and 2 May and 14 and 15 May respectively.
The Management Board is prepared to take action on this matter in accordance with the Commission's recommendations.
42. The situation of staff was very complicated due to the various accompanying measures, but all the people on the CEDEFOP payroll who were not made available to other organisations or who were posted to Berlin were working on CEDEFOP and its work programme.
43. The Administrative Board has decided on accompanying measures for the transfer (Framework Agreement) in order to take appropriate measures as soon as possible" (see statements in the Council Protocol).
The evaluation of actions must therefore take into account their political context.
The Centre is located in Thessaloniki and the Management Board and the Director decide on the organisation of the work.
Undoubtedly, certain positions are blocked as long as the accompanying measures are effective.
However, at the end of 1996 almost all activities will expire and then CEDEFOP will be able to operate fully on the basis of medium-term priorities (to be adopted in November 1996 on the basis of the Administrative Statute) and the 1997 Work Programme, which will also be based on these priorities.
CEDEFOP will therefore revitalize and revitalize the approach from 1997 onwards.
44. People who cannot leave Berlin for social or personal reasons, when the fixed period of stay in Berlin ends, have three alternatives.
Consequently, the Court of First Instance issued three provisions rejecting requests for interim proceedings.
They must move, resign from the Centre's service or find solutions in accordance with the Staff Regulations.
45. The effects in 1996 are obviously serious, but will be minimal after the first months of 1997.
The transfer had its consequences and costs.
However, if we compare them with similar transfers at national level, for example from Paris to Marseille (where only 21 out of 120 workers moved from the centre), CEDEFOP, with a view to the international transfer to a distance of almost 2000 km, did not have any undue negative effects on CEDEFOP.
Careful cost estimates show that cost neutrality will be achieved in 2000 and that work will be even more cost-effective (mainly due to lower labour costs in Greece). 46-66.
(b) it is not acceptable for the Administrative Board to accept that the legal framework in which the transfer of workers was carried out was not in line with the proper treatment of workers with high working experience and did not allow for the smooth transfer of CEDEFOP." (c) Following the decision of the Governing Board of 27 January 1995, the Council of 6 February 1995 (Regulation (EC) No 251/95) amended Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 in order to ensure that the staff of the Centre is subject to the rules and rules applicable to officials and other servants of the European Communities."
Despite the absence of transitional provisions, such as the adoption of Council Regulation (EEC, Eura: torn, ECSC) No 269/68 (see Article 102 of the status of officials of the European Communities).
Since, in the absence of transitional measures, the Administrative Board had no choice but to act under its own responsibility in order to protect the rights and interests of CEDE-FOP employees. e) It should not be forgotten that Regulation (EC) No 251/95, under which CEDEFOP was transferred from Berlin to Thessaloniki, had not taken place in connection with the sudden change of place of work referred to in the employment contracts. Berlin had been the only seat of CEDEFOP for 20 years and had not existed at any time since 10 February 1975.
(f) The Administrative Board was therefore required to: ensure a high level of safety for workers (the designation of officials for life), to ensure the protection of their categories, grades and grades, and to provide workers who would like to help to find work elsewhere. (g) The Administrative Board would also like to point out that the positions approved by the CEDEFOP budgetary authority were permanent positions.
In accordance with Articles 2 and 8 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the EC, these posts may be filled only by officials or temporary staff. h) In addition, Articles 2 and 8 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the EC provide that the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 251/95 and Regulation (EC) No 251/95 and Regulation (EC) No 251/95 concerning staff of the Centre and other servants of the European Communities expressly provide for the employment of officials.
Since the posts of the staff are permanent, the decision on the status of officials and not on the temporary employment contract was appropriate and justified.
The Administrative Board also wishes to comment on the issues raised by the Court: the 46th (last sentence) The Administrative Board had the choice to appoint staff to lifelong officials or to propose two-year agreements to them (see opinion in (g) above).
It was considered unacceptable to require workers to move from Berlin to Thessaloniki on the basis of a two-year contract.
48. Although it is true that the Administrative Board has not formally presented the findings of the financial controller in order to obtain confirmation, the Board of Directors has been informed of the decisions taken.
At the time of signing the agreement, the financial consequences of the agreement have not yet been established due to independent individual decisions taken by the employees.
It offered a framework which was the basis for individual decisions and which were fully approved by the financial controller during a visit to Berlin.
50-51.
In the light of the above, point (e) of the Decision (see note, second indent) was the only possible decision.
According to a clear statement from the Commission (see the last sentence of the Declaration on the Council Protocols in the Annex), the conditions of employment of CEDEFOP staff should not be affected."
The Commission's Legal Service's observations, cited only partially in point 56, leave sufficient room for such a decision to be taken.
The Administrative Board recalls that, in accordance with Article 29 of the Staff Regulations, the appointing authority is entitled to carry out internal selection procedures in order to fill vacant posts in the institution (point (lb).
The selection procedures have been carried out in full compliance with Annex III to the Staff Regulations.
55. The Management Board was designed and obliged to provide as many CEDEFOP staff as possible who agreed to move to Thessaloniki.
Whereas it should not be forgotten that Regulation (EC) No 251/95 amended the provisions applicable to staff as from 1 March 1995 and that the move to Thessaloniki took place in August of the same year;
The Administrative Board was based on the following considerations: on the basis of the two-year Thessaloniki Agreement (notes in point (g) and point 46 above) there was no time for a general selection procedure before moving to Thessaloniki and in this case it would not be realistic to expect workers to move without safe employment.

A request from employees to move after a low grade or grade assignment would make their situation worse.
The Commission's Legal Service note referred to in point 56 (d) provides sufficient arguments to justify the position taken by the Centre. 60 to 61.
All workers who applied for a nomination for life-long officials have completed the probationary period referred to in Article 34 of the status.
62. In accordance with note (f), the third indent above, the Administrative Board has considered it its duty to assist the worker in an acceptable manner.
The Commission's Legal Service has also taken this position.
65. The provisions governing the way in which the transfers of funds of part of the remuneration are made allow the part of the remuneration to be increased from 35 to 50% on a case-by-case basis where there are reasonable grounds as referred to in Article 4 of the Regulation.
The framework agreement allowed, in individual cases and for certain obligations provided for in the Staff Regulations, which were received before 29 October 1993 (the date on which the European Council decided to transfer the Centre), the transfer of a higher percentage (> 35%' in the Staff Regulations but < 50%).
The application of these provisions is entirely different for CEDEFOP and only applies to a limited number of people with high obligations in Berlin.
66. The Management Board thankes the Commission for the assistance it has provided in many cases in the search for alternative jobs for workers unable to move to Thessaloniki and for any assistance it has provided almost daily during the move.
68. See the Management Board's comments on paragraphs 23 and 24.69.-70.
See in particular the general comments in paragraphs 46 to 66.
71. The Management Board regrets that the legislator has not included any transitional provisions in Regulation (EC) No 251/95 in order to address the difficult staff problems arising from the move to Thessaloniki.
In the absence of the appropriate instruments, the Management Board was all the more obliged to make every effort to support the CEDEFOP staff.
The Administrative Board considers that it acted under these circumstances, under circumstances that are truly unprecedented, in a way that can be accepted.
Finally, it was clear that he had to make the same efforts (as the Court considers) because it is his duty, as an employer, to conduct the international process of the liquidation of the complete institution in a socially acceptable manner.
The board, the director and the staff acted in this positive spirit and could take risks, but they did not abuse power, nor acted against the law.

The Court of Auditors shall be required to audit these accounts in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
3. The Court has carried out an audit in accordance with generally accepted control standards insofar as they apply to the Community context; it has therefore carried out an accounting audit and has carried out other control procedures which it considered necessary in this regard.
On 1 December 1995, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2017/247 [3] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 1 December 1995 to 31 December 1995 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 1 December 1995 to 31 December 1995 for the period from 1 December 1995 to 31 December 1995 for the period from 1 December 1995 to 31 December 1995.
Dublin Foundation started its operations in 1976.
The scope of the audit of the 6th Court of Auditors reviewed the annual accounts and the financial management of the Dublin Foundation in 1995 in accordance with the relevant regulations (2).
Financial data 7. For the financial year 1995 the Foundation had funds of ECU 12.5 million.
These commitments led to payments of ECU 9.3 million and transfers of ECU 3 million for the financial year 1996, the remaining amount being cancelled of ECU 0.2 million.
From the appropriations carried over from the previous year, ECU 1.9 million were paid and ECU 0.2 million were cancelled.
Annex 3 to this report shall include an analysis of the use of appropriations from the financial year and appropriations carried over from 1994, broken down by title.
The Court reiterates its earlier observations that the tasks of the authorising officer and the accounting officer are not sufficiently separated.
This is contrary to Article 15 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76, according to which the principle of "Agreement with the authorising officer and the accounting officer" and with the actions of the authorising officer, the financial controller and the accounting officer [...]'.
Paying Agency 9. A significant part of the payment (1995: 5 9 %, without remuneration) remains without the prior consent of the financial controller.
The scope of use of the paying agency is not in line with the financial rules.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 on the establishment of the Foundation (OJ L 26, 26.1.1975, p. 1).
(OJ L 139, 30.5. 1975), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1947/93 of 30 June 1993 (OJ 1993 L 139, 30.5.1993), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1947/93 (OJ 1993 L 139, 30.5.1993).

3.97 current or smaller expenditure, where the risk of irregularities is relatively low, should be cleared through the paying agency; the Foundation, in agreement with the financial controller, should specify in writing what is to be understood as current and smaller expenditure;
In 1995 the Foundation continued to transfer the appropriations for the title (see paragraph 16).
This is contrary to Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of ECU 1494 000 (11.9% of the budget) whereas in 1994 they were still ECU 75600 (6,5%).
16. As a result of transfers of ECU 500,000 under Title 1 (personal) to Title 3 (operational expenditure), the Foundation may have transferred commitments to the following financial year which would otherwise have to be cancelled in accordance with Article 6 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76.
As already stated in paragraph 10, the Court considers that such transfers in title are contrary to financial rules.
In accordance with Annex 3 to this Regulation, the total value of the payment transaction shall be 75%, while the value of the transaction shall be 54%, while the value of the transaction shall be 54% for Title 3 of Title 3 of Title 3 of Title 3 of Title 3 of the Financial Regulation.
Table 1 shows the breakdown into allocations from the 1995 budget and then their use in 1996.
The transfers under Title 3 amounted to 45% of the original measures.
Only 20% of transfers were used until the end of March 1996.
Revenue 18. EU assistance to the Foundation in 1995 amounted to ECU 12.5 million.
The amounts actually requested and received amounted to ECU 2,5 million on 26 April 1995, ECU 2 million on 14 June 1995, ECU 4,3 million on 12 October 1995 and ECU 1,3 million on 31 December 1995.
The difference of ECU 2,4 million was equivalent to unnecessary financial resources which were not made available to the Commission in accordance with the Court's recommendation of the previous year.
As in previous years, the financing formula is incompatible with Article 26 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93, which provides for the payment of the grant during the first half of each quarter.
(19) Article 63 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 of 30 June 1993 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of 1 June 1976 requires contracts of a value exceeding ECU 12 000 to be awarded by tender.

20. In two cases, it was found that expenditure had been cleared before the budgetary commitment was made.
In one case, the accounts for November and December 1994 were included in the commitments entered into in 1995, although the framework agreement between the Foundation and the contractor started on 1 January 1995.
21. In a sample of 10 study contracts, five study contracts were received only one month after the date specified in the contract.
22. In the course of the audit, the Court found that the documents had been amended by the corrective fluid, in the following cases: on 17 December 1994, on 17 January 1995 on 17 January 1995, on the date on which the invoice for the financial controller of 45 365 DM (ECU 23 817) was closed, on 17 January 1995, on 17 December 1994, was overwritten by the corrective fluid.
The financial controller confirmed its decision on the basis of this fax and the amendment of the date • led to expenditure being booked for expenditure for the 1994 transfers and not for expenditure of 1995 not for expenditure of 1995 not for expenditure of 1995 not for expenditure of 1995 not for expenditure of 1995 for expenditure of 1995 not for expenditure of 1995 and the amount in the recovery order was overwritten by corrective fluid and manually amended from ECU 1680,16 to ECU 4 741,97.
It is not clear what amount the approval of the financial controller refers to.
27. The control of the payment sample revealed problems in the management of the contracts and inadequate changes in the relevant documents, see paragraphs 19 to 22.

13. 3.97 I DE I Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/25 ANS. 8. The Foundation has introduced a number of measures to separate the tasks of the authorising officer from the tasks of the accounting officer.
The Court of Auditors noted these initiatives in previous reports.
The only problem in practice is the procedure whereby the authorising officer records expenditure in the existing integrated accounting system.
This problem will be resolved once the Foundation has created a new accounting system.
Following the 1995 consultation, the Foundation, together with other EU agencies, participated in a joint procurement procedure for the purchase of the relevant accounting system in 1996.
However, the result was that none of the candidates met the institution's requirements in 100%.
Following detailed contacts with the Commission services, it is expected that in 1997 the Foundation will acquire an adequate accounting system from the Commission after the final completion of the work on an adequate system that meets the Agency's technical and legal requirements.
9. The Foundation contacted the Commission services to address the identified problem.
The Foundation was informed that this issue would be discussed between the Commission and the European Parliament in the framework of the ongoing dialogue on the Agency's Financial Regulation.
10. Following the last Court of Auditors report, the Foundation asked the Commission services to clarify the Foundation's Financial Regulation on these transfers.
The Foundation is currently informed by DG XIX that the transfer has been carried out in accordance with the Foundation's Financial Regulation (see also paragraph 16).
11. All missions at the Foundation have been documented and approved by the authorising officer after ensuring that they comply with the Foundation's work programme or administrative requirements.
The Foundation shall review its procedures for recording and searching the necessary documentation for missions.
The Foundation Regulation requires consultation of the European institutions and the involvement of the social partners in their work.
Although there has been an intensive exchange of information with the EU bodies concerned in Brussels in recent years, there has been no increase in the number of missions to Brussels.
No business trips shall be carried out if other means of communication may be used.
Where possible, telephone, internet, e-mail and other electronic tools are used. In November 1995, a video conference was also launched.
There have also been experiments with conferences on communication.
14. On the basis of the request made by the Irish authorities, lawyers are currently preparing a revised lease agreement.
16. In accordance with the above paragraph, the Commission informed the Foundation that the transfers were fully in line with the Financial Regulation; the Foundation's assistance could be used in the most effective way by decisions taken by the budgetary authorities.
However, the Foundation appreciates the position of the Court of Auditors and of Parliament and seeks to make such transfers only in urgent cases.
These agreements mainly concerned research with 12-month implementation deadlines.
18. The Foundation reminds the Commission services that payments must be made by the 15th quarter of each quarter.
19. The Treaty on European Labour Conditions states that this agreement was concluded under the framework agreement between the European Commission and INRA (Europe) under the open tender procedure for the European Commission's and INRA's (Eurobaromètre) standard.
The contracts awarded free of charge were fully in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 46 of the Foundation's Financial Regulation and with the criteria to be complied with in this respect; in the case of computer supplies, Article 46 (d) was applied.
Only one supplier had the required software, as well as special multitasks, providing local support: the other two contracts refer to research proposals.
The Foundation's Administrative Board at its meeting on 25 March 1994 approved the introduction of new procedures, which should be fully operational in 1995, in respect of contracts based on calls for expressions of interest published in the Official Journal, and tenders.
Both agreements were concluded during a transitional period defined by the Governing Board.
20. The Foundation operates a decentralised procurement system.
Both accounts were part of a series of orders submitted by an operating entity whose total orders exceeded the financial obligations.
Appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent the repetition of these measures.
The introduction of a new accounting system should ensure that the required controls are carried out automatically.
21. Monitoring of the implementation of the study contracts takes place on a monthly basis in the framework of programme management.
22. The contract was submitted for the services concerned on 11 October 1994.
The change in the date on the invoice had no impact on the transfer.
Yet the defendant was prosecuted.
In the future, the required manually adjustments will be signed and dated.
13. 3.97 [Official Journal of the European Communities C 81/27 Report on the annual accounts of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA-London) together with the Agency's replies (97/C 81/03) (1 September 1994 to 31 December 1995) 1.1.
This report shall be submitted to the Management Board of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in accordance with Article 57 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 (a) 1.2.
The Court examined the annual accounts of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 57 (7) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, the budget has been implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director.
Whereas it is also responsible for drawing up and presenting an invoice (2), and must respect the internal financial rules provided for in Article 57 (11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is required to examine that invoice;
This is the Agency's first evaluation report.1.3.
The main observations of the Court's audit are set out in the second part of this report. 1.4. The financial statements for the financial years 1994 and 1995 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are fully guaranteed.
Ç) OJ L Ç, Ç.
In accordance with Article 57 (9) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, an invoice for all the Agency's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 was drawn up on 31 March 1996.
On 9 April 1996, that accounting was transferred to the Court.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In the financial year 1995, the Agency recovered a grant from the Commission (ECU 10.1 million) without issuing appropriate recovery orders.
Accounting for budgetary operations 1.6.
Until August 1995, there was no commitment and payment log for this financial year.
At the end of the year, the Agency established an accounting system.
The Court found that that system would allow for subsequent changes to bookings that would not be noticeable.
In the absence of commitments on a date, the available appropriations were exceeded (infringement of Articles 29, 35 and 36 of the Financial Regulation to the Agency), although the Administrative Director presented an amending budget approved by the Management Board (moved from chapter to chapter).
By August 1995, the Agency cleared all payments via the paying agency.
Such additional use of the paying agency procedure infringes Article 45 of the Agency's Financial Regulation, which provides for this procedure only for certain types of expenditure. 1.8.
Furthermore, the Agency did not start clearing the expenditure until September 1995.
on 31 December 1995, around ECU 937 000 had to be paid on 31 December 1995;
General account 1.9.
In connection with the closure of the paying agency, accounting and budgetary records took place only in September and December 1995.
It violates accounting rules.

The commercial accounting systems available on the market do not take into account the specificities of the Community financial rules.
Therefore, in 1995 the agencies issued a call for tenders in respect of a system corresponding to their needs.
Until the new system is introduced, the Agency will work with the Sheet Spread system.
Although this system may introduce subsequent changes in accounting, they may not be included in budgetary accounting.
However, these changes can be found in the overall financial statements.
All budget operations shall be documented.
In the initial period until the appointment of the home financial controller, the paying agency was necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Agency.
Only in this way could the Member States' decisions on the establishment of the Agency be implemented swiftly;
On 3 July 1995, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2017/247 [2] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2020.
On 12 December 1995, 75% of payments made through the paying agency were settled.
Even if a large amount could only be cleared in 1996, the Agency achieved a satisfactory final result and in difficult circumstances carried out its task.
That report shall be submitted to the Budget Committee of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in accordance with Article 137 of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 (*).
The Court examined the annual accounts of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
Whereas, pursuant to Article 119 (2) (c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 (2), the budget has been implemented under the responsibility of the President of the Office;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 137 of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94, it is also responsible for drawing up and presenting an invoice (3), in accordance with internal control rules; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is required to control that invoice;
This is the report from the Office's first audit. 1.3.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Commission assistance 1.5.
During the 1995 financial year, the Authority made only ECU 6.8 million (68%) ver-i1) (OJ 1995).
OJ L 11, 14.1.1994, p. 33.
(3) In accordance with Article 137 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94, the accounts relating to all the Office's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up on 29 March 1996, signed by the President of the Office and forwarded to the Commission, the Budget Committee and the Court of Auditors.
On 2 April 1996, the accounts were forwarded to the Court.
The tables attached to this report present these financial statements in a summary form.
The Court considered that the Authority should have issued a recovery order for the entire budget (ECU 10,1 million) in order to meet the commitments carried over to the 1996 financial year (ECU 4,6 million).
During the financial year 1995 the Authority established an accounting system.
This is contrary to the internal financial regulation (Articles 4 (1) and 29 (1)).
Transfers and transfers of funds 1.7.
The appropriations carried over to 1996 represent 46% of the budget and relate primarily to computer equipment (Titles II and III of the budget).
In addition, the available appropriations have been transferred from Title I (personal) to Title II (current expenditure) of ECU 2,529 million (25% of the budget).
The list shall be kept only quantitatively but not in terms of value.
It is therefore impossible to adapt to the amounts entered in the Office's balance sheet.
The management system established by the Authority does not ensure adequate division of responsibilities and proper implementation of the rules on income, commitments and payments (authorised authorising officer, financial controller and accounting officer).
The Authority is currently located in the Spanish Government building.
However, there is no contract for the use of this building.
In order to ensure its final establishment in the future, the Authority should clarify the needs for the accommodation of its services.
13. 3.97 AND DE 1 Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/33 This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 26 September 1996.
TABLE 1 TRANSMISSION OF PROVISIONS FOR 31 DECEMBER 1995 "2 17 1 4 2 7 194 3 469 1487 15 3 275 1 879 6127 Accruals for the interim 15 Liabilities in total 1487 6 127 169
No C 81/36 p 5 in the Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3.97 of the Commission's response to the Commission's payment 1.5.
The need for a recovery order was not aware of either the Commission or OHIM.
OHIM took note of this remark from the Court of Auditors and made sure that for the financial year 1996 a recovery order covering the total amount of aid minus the reserve was issued immediately for the financial year 1996.
keeping accounts for budgetary operations 1.6. It is true that the accounting system currently applied by OHIM allows for subsequent changes in accounting;
For the period until the introduction of Sincom2, developed by the Commission, OHIM has adopted organisational provisions to provide additional security guarantees when using the current system.
Until then, OHIM has no choice but to wait for the Commission's accounting system, which should be available before the end of the year, because the development of such a system means a large financial burden which the Authority itself cannot bear.
In 1995, the Authority's budget was adopted with a reserve of ECU 2 million required by Parliament for a general budget of EUR 10.1 MECU.
The reserve was abolished in two stages: in October 1995: ECU 1 million, in November 1995 the balance.
The temporary blocking of measures had of course had an impact on their use, in particular on the measures in Title I (Personal) as it was not certain that the reserves would be effectively abolished.
OHIM could under no circumstances decide on the employment of workers until the payment of the remuneration was ensured by the end of the financial year.
Following the release of the reserves, measures have been taken to use the appropriations allocated on the budget lines, on which budgetary commitments have been made and on which real needs existed.
For this reason, the Authority requested the transfer of the appropriations under Title I to Title II in order, in particular, to create computer equipment^, which was particularly needed in the initial phase of the Authority.
It should be recalled that OHIM started operations on 1 April 1996 and that more than 30,000 applications for trademarks have been received since, while the workload for the entire financial year has been estimated at 15 000 applications.
List 1.8. At the time of the Court's review, OHIM had only received from the Commission the software for the computer management of the stock register, which had just been installed.
Task sharing 1.9.
In reply to the Court of Auditors' reply to the question, it was clarified that the question concerned the order of signatures to be applied in the procedures for commitments and payments.
It is therefore not a mistake with regard to the liability of the authorising officer, the accounting officer and the financial controller.
In fact, the point was that the operation was first signed by the accounting officer and subsequently by the authorising officer. · This approach was beneficial that, at the initial stage of the authorising officer's duties, when there was no authorising officer, it was ensured that the appropriations were available before the operation was signed by the authorising officer; after OHIM now has the authorising officer, the following order of signatures of the various budget documents can be observed: (1) the authorising officer, (2) the authorising officer, (3) the financial controller, (4) the accounting officer.
Fixed assets 1.10.
There is an agreement (see copy in annex) between the Minister of Industry of the Government of Spain
13. 3.97 ~D in OJ C 81/37 and Internal Market Commissioner Vanni d'Archirafi. On the basis of this agreement, the Spanish authorities make the building (temporary building) available to the Authority free of charge and this is the building in which the Office is currently accommodated.
In accordance with that agreement, the Spanish Government will take action to make available to the Authority its final seat.
On 3 July 1996, the Spanish authorities decided on the site and the tender specifications for the construction of the building.
This specification will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 30 July of this year (invitation to submit tenders).
Following these recent developments, the Authority shall take the necessary steps without delay.
This report shall be transmitted to the Governing Board of the European Training Foundation in accordance with Article 11 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 of 7 May 1990 0.
The Court examined the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 11 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90, the budget has been implemented under the responsibility of the Director.
Whereas, in accordance with Article 11 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90, it is also responsible for drawing up and submitting an invoice (2), in accordance with internal financial rules; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is required to examine that invoice;
This is the report from the Foundation's first study.
The Court carried out an audit in accordance with generally accepted control standards insofar as they apply to the Community context.
He carried out an accounting check and applied other control procedures deemed necessary in this context.
The main observations arising from the Court's audit are set out in the second part of this report.
(2) In accordance with Article 11 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90, the accounts relating to all the Foundation's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 were drawn up at 31 March 1996, signed by the Director of the Foundation and forwarded to the Commission, the Governing Council and the Court of Auditors.
The tables attached to this report shall provide this financial information in a summary form.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Accounting for budgetary operations 1.5.
This system and systematic handling through the paying agency may lead to the overrun of the appropriations.
Paying agency 1.6.
The Foundation made all payments through the paying agency in 1995.
This is not in accordance with Article 43 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the Foundation, which provides for such a procedure only for certain types of expenditure.
Moreover, the clearance of these expenditures was delayed as the relevant documents were sent to the financial controller for approval to Brussels.
1.7. ^ The Foundation has granted several of ECU 0.4 million to use the funds available at the end of the financial year.
However, it failed to comply with the rules on public procurement, in particular with regard to competition in terms of prices or results (Articles 45 to 51 of the Financial Regulation for the Foundation).
Financial controller 1.8.
In the current situation, the Foundation's internal control system could be improved by assigning the Foundation's financial controller to the Commission acting on the spot.

No C 81/42 is the Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3.97 FUNCTIONING ANSWERS 1.5.
Accounting of the balance sheet - The Foundation shares the opinion of the Court of Auditors.
In addition, it has played a key role in the implementation of the single system of budgetary and financial management in all departments.
Discussions are currently under way with the responsible Commission services to overcome any concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors by introducing a new budgetary management system that will enter into force on 1 January 1997.
It should be noted that none of the available budgetary resources were exceeded during the period under review.
1.6 Advance management It should be stressed that advances were not used for all purchases of equipment or for participation in real estate, which constituted a significant part of the budget.
In addition, in accordance with Article 43 of the Financial Regulation, the application of general pre-financing payments has now been reduced and all accounting documents of the month in question will be sent to the accounting officer in Brussels within 10 and 20 months of the following month, respectively.
On the one hand, the agreements in question, closely related to the activities and projects covered by the Foundation's work programme, represent a very small part of the Foundation's activities, both in terms of number and budget.
On the other hand, it is true that the involvement of the competition that led to the conclusion of these agreements took place informally.
This procedure was chosen at that time mainly because of the urgency of the case.
In addition, the agreements in question were intended to organise conferences and seminars on behalf and on behalf of the Foundation and under the strict control of the Foundation.
The budget was divided into two parts: a fixed part of the remuneration (less than ECU 12 000) and an operational part, which was previously defined by the Foundation and returned on the basis of supporting documents.
On the basis of these elements, the Foundation considered that the actual application of the agreement would not exceed ECU 12 000.
When it became clear at the beginning of 1996 that the Court of Auditors did not share this opinion, the system was abandoned.
The Accounting Foundation shares the opinion of the Court of Auditors.
This report shall be submitted to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency in accordance with Article 13 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (J1).
The Court examined the annual accounts of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
In accordance with Article 13 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the budget has been implemented under the authority of the Executive Director.
Whereas it is also responsible for drawing up and submitting an invoice (2), in accordance with the internal financial rules provided for in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 0; whereas, in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Court of Auditors is required to examine that invoice;
The Court carried out an audit in accordance with generally accepted control standards insofar as they apply to the Community context.
He carried out accounting checks and applied other control procedures deemed necessary in this context.
The financial statements for the financial years 1994 and 1995 are reliable and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are generally guaranteed.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Aid to the Commission 1.5.
During the 1995 financial year, the Agency introduced only part of the budget-i1) OJ L 120, 11.5.1990, p. 4.
(2) In accordance with Article 13 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the invoice for all the Agency's revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1995 was drawn up on 20 June 1996, signed by the Executive Director of the Agency and forwarded to the Commission, the Management Board and the Court of Auditors.
On 29 June 1996, this report was received by the Court of Auditors.
The tables set out in the Annex to this Report set out the financial statements in the context of the assessment of the assessment of the potential potential for the assessment of the potential for the assessment of the potential of the potential for innovation and innovation in the field of innovation and of the potential for innovation in the field of innovation and innovation in the field of education and innovation in the field of education and innovation in the field of education and innovation in the field of education and innovation in the field of education and in the field of education and in the field of education and education.
The Court considers that for the financial year 1995 the Agency should have issued a recovery order in order to meet the commitments carried over to the financial year 1996 (total of ECU 7 million); overshooting of the appropriations 1.6.
Title I (personal expenditure) and Title II (current expenditure) of the budget show several budget overruns of a total of around ECU 0,4 million.
This amount, which cannot be entered in the 1995 budget, is included on the assets side of the balance sheet in the trust account and must be entered in the budget for the financial year 1996 (infringement of Articles 5, 27, 29c and 43 of the Agency Financial Regulation).
Paying agency 1.7.
Almost all payments to be settled under Titles I and II of the budget have been settled through the paying agency.
The use of this paying agency is incompatible with Article 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation as the administrator of the pre-financing was the accounting officer at the time and managed the funds in certain budget lines.
Moreover, the deadlines for the submission of supporting documents were not respected and the availability of payment appropriations was not checked.
This seems to be the main reason for exceeding the abovementioned amounts.
Moves 1.8.
As at the end of the financial year 1994, at the end of 1995 a very large part of the available funds (ECU 7 million... 57.2% of the total amount) was transferred.
Most transfers concerned Title III (operational expenditure) (ECU 6.4 million) 90.3 % of the appropriations entered in that Title).
A significant proportion of the 1994-95 carry-over of ECU 8,5 million ( ECU 1,8 million) had to be cancelled (21% of the carry-over).
No C 81/44 ΓΟΕ" Official Journal of the European Communities 13. 3.97 Subsequent consultation with the financial controller 1.9.
Several applications for a commitment of ECU 0,5 million have been submitted to a financial controller of ECU 0,5 million.
In these cases, the financial controller refused to approve these cases, with which the Administrative Board broke up.
The Court stresses the obligation to comply with the financial rules, according to which all measures which may lead to expenditure from the budget" (Article 27 of the Financial Regulation for the Agency) must be covered in advance by an appropriate budgetary commitment request.
The division of tasks has not been complied with in the administrative department of the Agency.
Due to the lack of staff in the field of accounting at the same time, the same person was an accountant, accountant, administrator, and accountant/teacher of certain budget items.
Accounting systems 1.11.
For the purposes of budgetary and general accounting, two independent systems are used, which are not interlinked.
Moreover, the budgetary accounting system does not provide for any restrictions if the available appropriations or budgetary constraints are exceeded.
Financial Controller 1.12.
The Management Board has appointed a financial controller for the Commission.
The Court considers that, on the basis of the current functioning of the Agency, full financial control should be granted, which was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg on 28 October 1996, on 28 October 1996.

• The European Environment Agency was established in Copenhagen in mid-1994.
As early as 31 October 1994, the first budget of ECU 10.2 million was adopted.
Since the decision on the Agency's seat was delayed, the Agency had to work particularly quickly at the beginning of the Agency's operations.
Thanks to the great commitment, the projects were identified and the commitments were met before the end of the year, but for more important reasons, the implementation of the commitments could not start before the end of 1994.
In 1995, the Agency had to implement not only the budget of 1994, but also a new budget of ECU 10,5 million for 1995, before the Agency's permanent staff began the service.
Open positions were announced in November 1994, and after a long competition in which more than 7000 candidates took part, the first candidates, who were selected in the summer of 1995, started working.
In short, the Agency had an ambitious work programme and almost two budgets, but had a very limited number of employees to carry out this task.
Nevertheless, the work has moved forward and work on important projects, such as the Dobris report and the revision of the fifth Environmental Action Plan, was completed in 1995.
Five European thematic response centres were set up and the creation of EIONET started.
On 1 January 1995, with the support of 10 temporary staff, such as national experts and support staff,... and on 31 December 1995, on 31 December 1995, on 31 December 1995, on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995 on 31 December 1995
The Agency's administrative system was gradually expanding as the same open recruitment procedure was applied.
However, in 1995 the Agency clearly did not have sufficient human resources to deal with the procedural and financial aspects of the work.
As regards the financial side, in the first half of the year there was only one person who dealt with financial, budgetary and contractual issues of the work programme.
In June 1995, the head of the administrative department started working and only at the beginning of 1996 did the other persons dealing with financial and contract issues join them.
Although the Agency has carried out its task, some errors have been made in the area of finance and budget in relation to the procedures required.
Overshoot of appropriations Overshoot of certain budget lines.
On the one hand, because the Agency's budgetary control system was not working satisfactorily and on the other hand, some payments were not booked, because the Agency's financial department was clearly understaffed.
As a result, the accounts found a discrepancy between the accounts and the payments actually made, which affected certain budget lines.
Since deductions between the different budget headings can no longer be made after 1 January, these amounts must be entered in the 1996 accounts, i.e. in the 1996 budget.
In 1996, expenditure and appropriations available in Titles I and II (i.e. Problem Points 1995) were subject to careful scrutiny in order to avoid excess expenditure.
Failure to comply with the procedures (requesting the financial controller) A work programme was developed at the stage of the establishment of the Agency and started to be implemented before the administrative procedures were clearly defined and an appropriate governance structure was made available to monitor compliance with the procedures.
In some cases, this has led to the commissioning and execution of the work, leaving aside certain procedural rules.
In particular, work was commissioned without the prior consent of the financial controller in Brussels, which is a prerequisite for such operational expenditure.
This error was purely procedural and was due to the need to carry out the work, but the necessary administrative structures to ensure compliance with the provisions set out in Brussels have not yet been set up.
A clear delegation of implementing powers has been carried out and staff shall be informed of the procedural rules.
As in all public institutions, some functions of the Agency should be separate in financial terms.
One of the basic principles is that obligations and payment orders should not be executed by the same person.
However, at the time of the development of the Agency in Copenhagen, the number of employees was low enough that it could not be respected.
The Court of Auditors rightly questions this fact.
In the case of the Environment Agency, the Agency's financial controller and the Commission shall be the same person established in Brussels.
This would make the Agency's work much more difficult.
The solution to this dilemma is the creation of a paying agency.
And the m rule works like a small cash reserve, although the amounts that it has cleared are quite significant.
Instead of obtaining prior authorisation for financial control, the Agency has ordered its payment and, once a month, sends a list of transactions carried out by the paying agency in order to obtain authorisation for financial control.
On the one hand, this makes the work of the paying agency easier, but on the other hand it is a two-part sword, because internal control of the agency and the financial department must be able to meet this additional responsibility.
The Court of Auditors' reservations are therefore understandable, but, as long as the financial controller is based in Brussels, the Agency does not see the possibility of the paying agency being extensive in this regard. · The Agency therefore is very likely to take note of the Court of Auditors' recommendation that the Commission has at its disposal a financial controller.The Environment Agency would welcome this step.
The computer-based accounting system of the Court of Auditors stresses the need for the Agency to introduce a modern accounting system which would cover both general accounting and budgetary control.
The EU's financial system, which has been built, is a necessary computer tool to avoid the debt of significant financial and budgetary resources.
The Environment Agency wholeheartedly supports the Court of Auditors' conclusions.
Since the beginning of 1995, the Agency has tried repeatedly to find a solution to this problem.
It is the same for the other EU agencies.
In 1996, the agencies issued a joint invitation to tender but did not succeed, i.e. a satisfactory system was not found.
The Agency is currently working on the possibility of using Sincom's new budgetary control system 2.
The planning foresees that it will be installed and ready to act in good time in order to implement the budget in 1997.
Nevertheless, soft budgetary control and other general control will continue.
They will also not be integrated with software, and the Agency will continue to seek an appropriate solution to these problems and will seek coordination with other agencies.
13. 3.97 DE Official Journal of the European Communities C 81/49 Report on the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) together with the Centre's replies (97IC 81/07) (1 November 1994 to 31 December 1995) 1.1 This report was submitted to the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in accordance with Article 11 (11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 of 8 February 1993 n. 1.2.
The Court examined the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
Whereas, pursuant to Article 11 (8) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 (2), the budget has been implemented under the responsibility of the Director;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 11 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 (2), as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 3294/94 of 22 December 1994 (3), it is also responsible for drawing up and submitting an invoice (4);
The Court of Auditors shall be required to check this invoice in accordance with Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This is the report of the Centre's first audit.
The Court carried out an audit in accordance with generally accepted control standards insofar as they apply to the Community context.

The financial statements for the financial years 1994 and 1995 are reliable and legal and correct.
Main comments on the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial years 1994 and 1995 Commission assistance 1.5.
In 1995 the Centre issued a recovery order for only 57% ( ECU 3 million) of the grant.
The Court considers that the Centre should also have issued a recovery order for ECU 2,3 million (total ECU 5.3 million) in order to meet the commitments carried over to the 1996 financial year ( ECU 2.8 million).
Aid to the Portuguese Government 1.6.
The amount of ECU 614 015 (including interest) made available by the Portuguese Government to cover its seat shall not be included in the budget as income but only in the balance sheet.
Accounting for budgetary operations 1.7.
This may lead to overshooting.
Paying agency 1.8.
In 1995, the Centre carried out a significant proportion of its expenditure (45%) through the paying agencies.
The systematic use of the paying agencies procedure is incompatible with Article 43 of the Centre's Financial Regulation, which provides for this procedure only for certain types of expenditure.
Moreover, the accounts of these expenditures were delayed as these documents had to be sent to the financial controller in Brussels.
In 1995, significant appropriations were carried over to 1996, i.e. ECU 2.8 million, representing 52% of the Centre's budget.
Some appropriations carried over from 1994 to 1995 (a total of ECU 4,677 million) had to be cancelled ( ECU 0,368 million, i.e. 8% of the appropriations carried over).

13. 3.97 Ρ Ε ~ ΡΕ in the Official Journal of the European Communities No C 81/53 The following comments relate to the Court of Auditors' main comments on the implementation of the EMCDDA's budget for the financial years 1994 and 1995 (paragraphs 1.5 to 11 of the Court of Auditors' opinion).
The EMCDDA shares the view of the Court of Auditors that it would be more appropriate to issue a recovery order for all appropriations entered in the balance sheet in the form of a subsidy to the Commission, and for the budget in 1996 appropriate actions were taken. (b) Portugal, the Government of the Government, in which... (point 1.6 of the Court's observations) the EMCDDA acted in accordance with the Commission's recommendations (which is also a financial controller of the EMCDDA) within the meaning of Article 54 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Article 82 of the implementing rules to the same Regulation (in accordance with the spirit of Article 142 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities) the EMCDDA used, first of all, for the expenditure referred to in Article 54 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities within the meaning of Article 54 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (in accordance with the spirit of Article 142 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities).
The EMCDDA is aware, however, that it can only be a temporary system (based on Excel files can) and that it needs a more efficient accounting system.
In this context, decentralised agencies (including EMCDDA) published a call for tenders in Turin at the end of December 1995, in coordination with the European Training Foundation, in order to equip themselves with an integrated system of general accounts and budgetary accounts.
The EMCDDA implements the programming and control plan for the implementation of the budget and the work programme aimed at improving the use of the appropriations allocated, and in particular the limitation of the transfer of appropriations to exceptional cases. (f) The division of tasks (point 1.10 of the Court of Auditors' observations) C Due to the very limited number of staff in 1994 and 1995 the EMCDDA was unable to fully ensure compliance with the principle of division of tasks, as highlighted by the Court of Auditors.
The provisions of Article 16 of the financial provisions of the OEDT concerning the tasks of the authorising officer concerning the allocation of the tasks of the authorising officer, the financial controller and the accounting officer were fully complied with.
The EMCDDA is already trying to ensure the division of tasks in the performance of the various tasks in question.
In this context, it shall, where possible, take into account the requirements notified by the Court of Auditors in order to determine their short-term staffing needs in order to ensure that the administrative tasks referred to by the Court of Auditors (the management of paying agencies, the keeping of accounts, the management of staff or contracts) are carried out by different persons.
In June, the EMCDDA Board of Directors adopted a negative decision on the transfer of the tasks of the financial controller to an EMCDDA staff member (in particular on the basis of a decision of the European Commission) in the context of the adoption of the EMCDDA's financial rules.
As the European Commission's financial controller is also the financial controller of the EMCDDA, the Commission should also check whether it is possible for other decentralised agencies to appoint an on-the-spot financial controller, taking into account the solution to this issue.

EUR-Lex - 31997Y03133.06 - EN Page 1 of 5 Avis juridique important 31997Y03133.06 Report on the financial statements of the European Environment Agency (EEA-Copenhagen), together with the Agency's replies Official Journal C 081, 13/03/1997 P. 0043 - 0048 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Environment Agency (EEA-Copenhagen), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 81/06) (For the period from 1 September 1994 to 31 December 1995) 1.1.
This report is added to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency in accordance with Article 13 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (1).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director in accordance with the requirements of Article 13 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90. His responsibility includes the preparation and presentation of the accounts (2) in accordance with the internal financial provisions set out in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court of Auditors to audit these accounts.
This report establishes the first audit of the Agency.
The Court audited its audit in accordance with generally accepted audit standards in so far as they are applicable in the Community context.
The Court carried out checks on the accounts and records and also applied such additional audit procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The main observations resulting from the Court's audit are presented in the second part of this report.
The financial statements for the financial years 1994 and 1995 are related and the underlying operations were carried out, on the whole, in accordance with the rules concerning legality and regularity.
Main observations concerning the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial years 1994 and 1995 The Commission grants 1.5.
During the financial year 1995 the Agency used only part of the Commission provided for in the general budget (ECU 12 million, of which ECU 6.2 million was draw down).
It is the Court's opinion that the Agency should have issued a recovery order during the financial year 1995 for the balance remaining due (ECU 5.8 million) in order to meet the commitments that were carried over to the financial year 1996 (totaling ECU 7 million).
Spend in excess of available commitments 1.6.
Several cases of expenditure in excess of available expenditures, amounts to approximately ECU 0,4 million already, were found under Titles I (staff expenditure) and II (administrative expenditure) of the budget.
This http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997... 26/10/2010
EUR-Lex - 31997Y03133.06 - EN Page 2 of 5 amount, which could not be charged to the budget for 1995, was entered on the assets side of the balance sheet in a budget account, and had to be charged to the budget for the financial year 1996 (contravention of Articles 5, 27, 29c and 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation).
Imprest account 1.7.
Most all payments charged to the budget under Titles I and II were made via an impression account.
The implementation of this account was not in accordance with Article 43 of the Agency's Financial Regulation, since the administrator of the impress accounts was, at the time, both the Accounting and the Authorizing Officer for certain budget headings.
Further, the deadlines for the submission of supporting documents were not met and the availability of commitments committed was not verified before payments were made.
This situation seems to be the principal cause of the cases of spending in excess of available commitments pointed out above.
Appropriations carried forward 1.8.
At the end of the financial year 1995, as was already the case at the end of the financial year 1994, the percentage of commitments carried forward was very high in relation to the commitments available (ECU 7 million - 57.2 % of the total budget).
The majority of these carryovers concern title III (operational expenditure) (ECU 6,4 million, representing 90,3 % of the adaptations under this title).
A large share (ECU 1,8 million) of the approach carried over from 1994 to 1995, totaling ECU 8,5 million, had to be cancelled (21 % of the approach carried over).
A posteriori referral to the Financial Controller 1.9.
Several proposals for the commitment of funds totaling ECU 0,5 million were submitted, a posteriori, to the Financial Controller for his approval.
In these cases, the Financial Controller withheld his approval, but this feedback was overruled by the Management Board.
The Court wishes to emphase the obligation to respect the Financial Regulation and to submit proposals for commitments in due form prior to 'any measure of a kind which might lead to expenditure from the budget way (Article 27 of the Agency's Financial Regulation).
Separation dueties 1.10.
The separation of duties within the administration of the Agency has not been observed.
Due to a shortage of staff in the financial accounting department, the same person was, at one and the same time, Account Officer, administrator of the impres accounts and Authorizing Officer for certain budget headings.
Accounting systems 1.11.
The budget accounting and general accounting are carried out on two independent and unconnected computer systems.
The budget accounting system is, moreover, not programmed to repay entries in the event of commitments available, or commitments committed, being exhausted.
The Financial Controller 1.12.
The Management Board addressed the Commission's Financial Controller as their own Financial Controller.
The Court considers it would be acceptable, in respect of the Agency's present mode of operation, to address a full-time Financial Controller for the Agency.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at the Court meeting of 28 October 1996. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...

(2) Contrary to the requirements of Article 13 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90, the accounts for all revenue and expenditure of the Agency in respect of the financial year 1995 were not prepared until 20 June 1996, the date on which the accounts were signed by the Executive Director of the Agency and sent to the Commission, to the Board of Management and to the Court of Auditors.
These accounts were received by the Court on 28 June 1996.
The abridged version of these financial statements is presented in the tables included to this report.
THE AGENCY'S REPLIES The European Environment Agency was established in Copenhagen in mid-1994.
A first budget of ECU 10.2 million was adopted already on 31 October 1994.
Since the decision on where to locate the Agency had been delayed a fast start was needed.
Through a significant effect, projects could be identified and the budget committed before the end of the year, but for obvious reasons the execution of the commitments could barely start before the end of 1994.
Thus, in 1995 the Agency faced the dating task of execution, not only the budget from 1994 but also a new budget for 1995 of ECU 10,5 million, and this before the regular staff of the Agency had taken up duty.
The Vacan posts in the Agency were published in November 1994 and the selected candidates started coming on board in summer 1995 after a long selection procedure involving more than 7000 applications.
In short, the Agency had an ambitious work programme and virtually two budgets to execute, but very limited staff for the task.
Despite this, work went ahead and in 1995 the Agency finalized major projects, like the Dobris assessment, the review of the fifth environmental action plan.
Five European topic centre were established and the build-up of the EIONET advanced.
The build-up of the Agency progressive with regular staff increasing from 1 on 1 January 1995 (supported by 10 temporary staff, for example national experts and auxiliary staff) to 22 on 31 December 1995, still supported by 10 temporary staff.
The Agency's administration has progressively developed since the same open procedure to recruitment was applied.
Nevertheless, it was clearly too understood in 1995 to become the procedural and financial aspects of the work.
On the finance side only one person was available to handle the financial, budget and contractual aspects of the work programme during the first hast of the year.
In June 1995 the Head of Administration took up duty, and only in the starting of 1996 did the rest of the finance and contract staff come on board.
The Agency rose to the challenge, but some mistakes of a procedural nature were made in the areas of finance and budget.
Obspending There was overspending on some budget lines.
The reason was, on the one http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...
26/ 100/2010
EUR-Lex - 31997Y03133.06 - EN Page 4 of 5 hand, that the Agency's budget monitoring system did not function in a satisfactory way and on the other hand some executed payments were not introduced due to the fact that the Agency was seriously understood in the finance department.
As a consequence, when the accounts were closed, the discrepancy between the accounts and the payments actually made, shown up as overspending on some budget lines.
Since no adjustment between budget lines can be made after 1 January, this has to be booked on the 1996 accounts, i. e. be financed from the 1996 budget.
In 1996, the expenditures and the availability of commitments in Titles I and II, which was where the problems occurred in 1995, were carefully monitored in order to avoid overspending.
Procedures overlooked (Saisine a posteriori) During the build-up of the Agency, a work programme was established and started beng executed before administrative procedures had been well established and an administration in place to monitor that procedures were followed.
In some cases this led to work being ordered and transported out without all the procedures being observed.
In particular, work was contracted without the Financial Controller in Brussels having given his visa which is a prerequisite for this kind of operational expenditure.
It was not a question of finances being wasted or that the finances were not there.
The mistake was procedural and reflected that work had to be done and the procedures to ensure that this was done according to Community rules were not yet in place.
Procedures are now in place to avoid similar problems.
A clear delegation of authority powers have been established and staff informed of the rules.
Separation functions In the financial framework of the Agency, as is the case in all public institutions, certain functions should be kept separate.
A basec principle is that the same person should not commit money and order payment.
However, during the period of establishment of the Agency in Copenhagen the number of staff in the Agency was so small that it was not possible to observe this principle.
It is rightly criticized by the Court of Auditors.
However, once the staffing of the Agency started to increase this was corrected and these functions have been rigorously separated in the Agency since autumn 1995.
External use of impress accounts The normal procedure for committing and ordering payments in the EU-system is to have prior approval by the Financial Controller in practice all cases.
In the case of the Agency, the Agency Financial Controller is the same as the Commission's and located in Brussels.
To send all financial transactions to Brussels for improvement before they could actually be executed would be an optional tiresome procedure.
It would seriously obstruct the working of the Agency.
The way out of this dilemma is the impression account.
It works in principle as a petty-cash reserve although the amounts involved are important.
Instead of seeking prior approval from Financial Control, the Agency executes the payment and once a month the impress account is sent to the Financial Controller to have the ex post approval of the payments which have been made.
On the one hand this facilities the functioning of the Agency, but, on the other hand, it is a double-edged word since the Agency's internal controls and the financial department must have the capacity to hand this additional responsibility.
Thus, the criticism by the Court of Auditors is understandable, but as long as as http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997...
EUR-Lex - 31997Y03133.06 - EN Page 5 of 5 the Financial Controller is located in Brussels there is, in the Agency's view no alternative to an extensive use of the impress account.
It is therefore with great interest that the Agency has noted the recommendation by the Court of Auditors that the Financial Controller of the Commission should place a Financial Controller in the Agency.
Agency welcome welcome this step.
Computerized financial system The Court of Auditors understands the need for the Agency to find an up-to-date computerized financial system which can integrate the accounting side with the budget monitoring side.
In the complex financial system of the European Union such a computerized system is crucial to avoid having to tie down a lot of resources in financial and budgety work.
The Agency supports entirely the conclusion by the Court of Auditors.
Since the starting of 1995, the Agency has again and again tried to find a solution to this problem.
It is a problem which the European Environment Agency shares with the other EU Agencies.
In 1996, the Agencies launched a joint call for tips to find a solution but this call for tips has not been successful, i.e. no satisfaction system has been found.
This, the Agency is at present pursuant to the possibility of using the new budget monitoring system Sincom 2. The plan is to have it installed and operational in time to execute the 1997 budget on the basis of this system.
There will still be one software for the budget monitoring system and another for the general ledger.
Nor will the impact accounts be integrated in the software the Agency will continue to look for an efficient way of solving these problems and will endeavour to coordinate this work with the other Agencies.

19.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 309/25 INTRODUCTION 1. The European Environment Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 [1].
The Agency's task is to set up an environmental monitoring network that provides information to the Commission, the Member States and the general public on the state of the environment.
This information should in particular give the European Union and the Member States the opportunity to adopt environmental action and assess the effectiveness of these activities.
2. Table 1 summarises the Agency's obligations and responsibilities.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 shall contain relevant information on the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2006.

The following observations do not call into question the Court's observations.
COMMENTS 7 on 30 % of the budget commitments for the financial year concerned had to be made.
Operational expenditure (Title III and assigned revenue) expenditure for this purpose was higher than expenditure for this purpose.
In the last two months of 2006, the Agency has committed EUR 1.3 million of EUR 1.3 million, but in the last two months in 2007 the commitments of EUR 1.3 million have been carried over until 2007.
Following sampling (4) these results were found to relate, without exception, to the experience that took place in 2007.
Therefore, the principle of budgetary fairness was not strictly applied.
8. The authorising officer who received the sub-delegation not only carried out ex ante controls but also managed the rights of access to the electronic invoicing system, which is in breach of the principle of separation of tasks.

(2) Recovery of property taxes between 2000 and 2004 (EUR 905 000).
C 309/28 EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.12.2007 REPLY OF THE AGENCIES Relative profit participation in 2007 is largely linked to extraordinary events in 2006, which forced us to postpone interim payments in thematic centres until satisfactory delivery of services.
Until 1 January each year licensing agreements were required to maintain continuity, as well as the time needed to identify and negotiate new, complex work and time-consuming work.
The Agency will continue to seek to reduce revenue participation in this area.
The risks associated with the situation described were assessed by the management and the risk reduction controls were introduced.
The remaining risks shall be considered acceptable.
This will be re-evaluated in the mid-2007 review of the tasks vulnerable.

C 309/46 DE Official Journal of the European Union 19.12.2007 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 7. The Agency shall apply a very accelerated procedure for the implementation of aid schemes.
The last allocation to the Agency for aid amounted to EUR 250 million in 2006, which will be allocated over a period of three years, i.e. until 2009.
In the first six months of 2007, the Agency provided assistance of EUR 185 million, representing 74% of the annual budget.
The balance to be allocated at the end of the mandate is therefore expected to be small.

5.12.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 311/49 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 7 at the end of 2007, due to the multi-annual nature of the CARDS programmes, the Agency could continue to maintain commitments and payments to the annual programmes for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.
For CARDS, the commitment deadline is 2009 and the payment deadline is 2010.
The costs of these three programmes, which have not yet been closed, amounted to EUR 1.8 billion.
The fact that EUR 163 million (9%) is still committed and the total amount of EUR 453 million (25%) three years before CARDS indicates a very high penetration rate.
The Court commended the Agency's results in Special Report No 5/2007 (OJ C 285, 27.11.2007, p. 1).
8. The Agency shall do everything in its power to achieve this objective successfully.
It intends to conclude agreements with the various EU institutions on the agreement with partners from different EU countries.
The Agency shall also contact the Commission in order to formalise the issue of obtaining investment income and shall submit it to the Management Board for approval.

3. This liability information shall be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council, in accordance with Article 185 (2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (2), and shall be based on the evaluation of the Agency's accounts, which the Court must carry out in accordance with Article 2 (2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
4. The Agency's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 [3] were drawn up by its Executive Director in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and forwarded to the Court, which explains how the annual accounts, how and how and how and how and how.
5. The Court has carried out its work in accordance with international financial control standards (ISSAI) and international financial control rules (IFAC) (IFAC) (IFAC) (IFAC) (i) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi) (vi

(3) The accounts were drawn up on 30 June 2008 and received by the Court on 2 July 2008.
(4) ISSAI is f ISSAI Institutions International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions; IFAC is IFAC f IFAC International Federation of Accountants.
6. The Court shall establish the appropriate basis for the following information on compliance: on the reliability of the accounts, the accounts of the Agency for the financial year ending on 31 December 2007 shall be outstanding in all material respects.
COMMENTS 7. The Agency's 2007 budget was 72.0 million euro and 66.0 million euro in the previous year.
The budget of the Agency shall be financed by the remuneration and fees of the Agency for issuing or amending the certificates and certificates and by the Commission's contribution.
8. The 2007 establishment plan provided for 467 posts for temporary staff, an increase of 139 posts for the 2006 establishment plan.
Since staff expenditure did not cover actual staff expenditure, the Agency decided to reduce the number of posts and agreed with the Commission to reduce the number of posts to a maximum of 342, of which 333 at the end of the year.
However, the establishment plan has not been adapted accordingly.
The Agency should detail carefully the appropriateness of the payments to be submitted for approval by the home institution.
9. In accordance with the new Regulation of 1 June 2007 [5], the Agency has implemented EUR 14.9 million of EUR 14.9 million as assigned revenue to cover the possible costs of issuing certificates.
However, this amount was too high as it also covers holdings which were covered by the old Code.

In the case of the procurement procedure, the situation of the tenderers was unclear due to the lack of clear and complete information on the award criteria and their importance on the one hand and due to the method of financial valuation on the other hand.
In three other points (1) an in-depth procedure was carried out after the call for the declaration of interest, although the total value of the services to be provided exceeded the threshold from which the open procedure should be initiated.

C 311/26 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.12.2008 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 8. During the first two years of the implementation of the Staff Regulations, the revenue of the Agency was not sufficient to cover the expected total costs.
The Agency has therefore decided to carefully reduce its positions.
This is reflected in the staff policy plan 2008-2010 agreed with the Commission.
9. Old and new rules were applied in the initial phase in 2007.
The calculation of assigned revenue and fees shall be in accordance with Article 64 (5) of basic Regulation ((EC) No 216/2008) which provides that assigned revenue and fees, including revenue obtained in 2007, constitute assigned revenue.
The basic Regulation does not provide that the provisions adopted under the previous Regulation cannot be excluded.
The exact calculation method was submitted to the Budget Committee of the Governing Board (28 May 2008).
10. The Agency is fully aware of the need to comply closely with the Commission's public procurement rules.
The Commission will pay particular attention to informing potential tenderers of the award criteria and their assessment.

COMMENTS 7. More than 43% of payments had to be cancelled at the end of 2006.
In addition, the last quarter of the year increased the rise, resulting in the failure to comply fully with the budgetary principle.
8. In drawing up the budget and the establishment plan, no action was taken under the budget plan, leading to a large number of measures (4), inadequate employment planning (5) and a false presentation of the budget (6).
9. Legal obligations were made before the relevant commitments were made (7).
Some companies provided for 100% pre-financing, which is not in line with the principle of cost-effectiveness of the budget (8).
(4) More than 35 appropriations in 2006
(5) The absence of the recruitment targets led to the use of funds to which the budget of 1100 (basic appropriations) was reduced by EUR 1.2 million.
(6) In the budget, the Community contribution to the Community's contribution to the Community's budget (Article 31 (2) (c) of the Agency's Financial Regulation) shall be based on the Community's contribution to the Community's budget (Article 31 (2) (c) of the Agency's Financial Regulation).

19.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 309/61 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 7. The Agency's budget was used in over 50% to combat environmental pollution.
In this area, the Agency has launched invitations to tender for the allocation of four expenditures on ship pollution expenditure.
At the end of the process, two companies decided to withdraw their offers at the last minute and, therefore, only two companies could be granted.
This was intended to cancel payments at a significant amount at the end of the year.
8. The move of the Agency from Br from Brussels to Lisbon in 2006 had an impact on the budget, which was difficult to predict, including the resignation of almost 20% of the staff employed.
9. Procedures for avoiding subordinated liabilities coincide.
The pre-financing conditions will be reviewed in accordance with the Court's observations.

C 393/2 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12.97 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 1. This report is added to the Council and the European Parliament in conformity with Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 (a) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1946/93 (2).
2. The Court has examined the financial statements of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year ended 31 December 1996.
In accordance with Article 18 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 (3) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (4), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Management Board.
This liability included the drawing up and presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the financial provisions as provided for pursuant to Articles 65, 67 and 68 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (4) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 (3).
The Court of Auditors is required within the meaning of Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community to examine these financial statements.
3. The Court undertook its audit in accordance with generally accepted audit standards, in so far as they are applicable in the Community context, and, accordingly, carried out such tests of the accounting records and such other audit procedures as the Court deemed necessary in the circumstances.
4. In the opinion of the Court the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 1996'are related and the underlying transactions are, as a whole, legal and regular.
AUDIT OBSERVATIONS Introduction Background 5. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) was l established by the Council Regulation EEC No 337/75 {) as a satellite body of the European Community with the task of promoting vocational training at Community level.
Cedefop communicated operations in Berlin in 1976 and moved to Thessaloniki in 1995.
6. The same Regulation defines its role as that of assisting 'the Commission in enabling, at Community level, the promotion and development of vocational and in-service training', of contributing 'to the implementation of a common vocational training policy' and especially enabling 'the exchange of information and the comparison of expertise'.
Its main tasks in the field of vocational training are 'to compile documentation, to undertake to the development and coordination of research, to distribute useful documentation and information, to enable and support initiatives, and to provide a forum for all those concerned.'
Scope of the audit 7. The Court carried out a financial audit of the 1996 accounts and has reviewed the Centre's decisions concerning its temporal and permanent premises and staff situation.
Financial data 8. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the financial statements of the Centre.
Available approaches for the financial year 1996 estimated to ECU 14,8 million.
Commitments entered into gave rise to ECU 11,4 million in payments and ECU 2,1 million in carry-over to the financial year 1997, the balance of ECU 1,3 million having been cancelled.
Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year gave rise to ECU 4.2 million in payments and ECU 0.6 million in cancellations.
Table 3 of this report gives an analysis of the implementation of the approaches for 1996 as well as of those carried over from 1995.
Observations concerning budget implementation Separation of duties 9. The Centre has put in place adequate procedures for the separation of duties of authority officer, accounting officer and impres holder (5).
Imprest account 10. A high proportion (in 1996, including salaries) of payments continue to be made prior to approval by the Financial" Controller.
Last year (5) the Court recommended that the use of the.imprest account be limited to ongoing or small expenses, where' the risk of irregularities is comparatively low.
A Management Board decision defining which kind of expenses may be paid thrnnph the imnrest account has been established and came into force on 1 January 1997.
Transfers approaches 11. The value of transfers of approaches between different budget lines in 1996 was ECU 891 600 (6% of the initial budget), down from ECU 922 000 in 1995.
29. 12.97 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/3 12. Following consultations with and the approval of the different services in the Commission (DG IX, DG XIX and DG XX), the Centre transferred ECU 30 000 from budget line 117 6 'Other services and work sent out for translation and typing' to a newly-created budget line 1 1 1 0 'Auxiliries', and ECU 40 000 from budget line 1 0 0 0 'Basic premises' to a newly-created budget line 1 1 1 1 2 'Local agents'.
These new budget lines are created by the Centre.
The Court acknowledged the reasons for making these transfers, but notes that they are contrary to paragraph 4 (a) of Article 21 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 which states: 'appliances may be transferred only to budget headings for which the statement of expenditure has authorized approvals or carried a token entry'.
The same budget lines are also included in the 1997 budget with approval of the budget Authority.
Carry-over and cancellations of commitments 13. The volume of commitments carried over has decreased in 1996.
Nearly 77 % of final acceptances for 1996 were paid out in 1996 as compared with 61 % in 1995.
The percentage of commitments made and carried over to 1997'was 14% (28% in 1995).
The percentage of cancellations was 9 % compared with 10 % in 1995.
Table 4 shows the carry-overs from the 1996 initial budget by title and their subject use.
Observations concerning the revenue and expenditure account and the balance sheet Revenue 14. The EU subsidies for the Centre for 1996 was ECU 14 625 000.
The Centre actually requested and received ECU 14 410 000.
15. In 1996, for the first time Norway and Iceland paid the Centre ECU 9 6 1 3 5 as a contribution for their participation in the work programme.
Expenditure 16. Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 measures that contracts may be made by direct agreement where the contract involves an amount not exceeding the limit of ECU 12 000.
In the case of at least 17 studies contracts and five fixed asset purchases, contracts over that limit were made without following the tendering procedure as described in Article 45 of the Regulation, however all payments were approved by the Financial Controller.
17. The result of a study of deliveries in the submission of work by contractors for 1996 shown that 55 % of the contractors did. not respect the contractual deadline.
None of the minutes of management meetings contained any evidence of a review of the performance of contractors in meeting contractual deadlines.
Balance sheet 18. The Centre made an up-to-date inventory list as foreseen in Article 52 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (s).
Fixed assets of ECU 1 443 431 recorded in the 1996 balance sheet represents the historical cost of materials and furniture.
19· At the year end, cash balances board by. the Centre were ECU 4.1 million, down from ECU 5.9 million in 1995.
The Centre is again taking responsibility for managing large cash balances.
The Court recommends the Centre make its quarterly drawing from the Commission on the basis of its actual cash needs.
20. The balance sheet includes an amount of ECU 483 308 relation to 'VAT to recover', of which ECU 251 434 relationships to the year 1995 but not yet recovered due to the move to Thessaloniki.
The Court asks the Centre to do the necessary to recover this amount as soon as possible.
With regard to the 'VAT to recover for 1996', the Centre is recommended to explain to the responsible tax authorities every detail related' to this procedure to avoid funds being cancelled or optional funds in recovery.
Audit of the Centre's premises'and staff situation Temporary premises 21. As the Court observed last year (8), the Centre had to invest ECU 120,000 to fit out the premises to make the temporary building functional and'ready for use'.
At the time of the audit (May 1997), the Centre 'explained that these costs were involved to improve the conditions for efficient functioning of the Centre', but was unable to explain who was willing to bear these costs.
Permanent premises 22. The Centre and the Greek State signed on 22 June 1995, a basec agreement regarding the construction of the permanent building.
According to this agreement, the Centre will pay to the Greek State ECU 6 879 750 in four equal installations of ECU 1 719 937.
The first two were paid on 1 September 1995 and 1 September 1996
This third installation has to be approved by the budget Authority and the last installation will be paid when the building is handed" over.
23. If appropriate is given by the budgety Authority before 1 September 1997, the Centre will have paid to the Greek' State ECU 5 159 811 for the construction of the permanent building.
The construction of the building was planned to communication on 30 March 1997.
At the time of the audit (May 1997), the tendering procedure, which is managed by the Greek authorities, was not yet completed nor were any contracts signed.
As a consequence, no financial data or budget related to this investment was available for audit.
Staff 24. In 1996, the staff complement table authorized 81 posts (permanent and temporal positions), of which: 25 A, 11 LA, 15 B, 27 C and 3 D. At the time of the audit (May 1997), 78 persons were actually working in.
Thessaloniki, of which: 60 officials and temporary officials (25 A/LA, 10 B, 23 C and 2 D), 7 national experts, 5 local agents, 3 auxiliarias, 2 interims and 1 "stage."
25. Another three persons are working at Cedefop's office in Brussels, one person is followed to Eurostat for a cooperative project, three persons we're still in Berlin, This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors and 13 Novembers are on special leave (CCP) and one person has been ill for many months.
Many new members of staff have been recruited during 1996.
26. The Court has been informed of an investigation by the Greek tax authorities concerning, among others, tax and social security payments for local staff put at the disposition of Cedefop by a company in Thessaloniki.
Conclusion 27. In the case of at least 17 studies contracts and five fixed-asset purchases, contracts over the limit of ECU 12000 were made without following the tendering procedure as described in Article 45 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1416/76 as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1948/93 (see paragraph 16).
28. The Centre once again holds large cash balances.
This situation should be avoided by making quarterly drawings from the Commission on the basis of actual cash needs (see paragraph 19).
29. The Centre is recommended to make sure that the work concerning the permanent premises is progressive in conformity with the contract (see paragraph 23). in Luxembourg at the Court's meeting of 12 For the European Court of Auditors Bernhard FRIEDMANN President (!)

C 393/8 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12.97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRINING The nature of the observations of the Court of Auditors maces it possible for the Management Board of the Centre to react in a directmanner.
The Board will follow the structure of the Court's observations and conclusions.
The numbering of the annotated paragraphs correspond to that used in the Court's report.
12. The Centre thanks the Court for the understanding show for the indicated transfers, which were necessary for smooth functioning in the Greek context and points out the exceptional nature of these operations which will not recur under normal circumstances.
16. Concerning the procedure to call for tips the following points should be taken into account: a) Some ongoing contracts are based on earlier calls for interest and for tender.
In the case of the documentary network, for which contracts are mostly above ECU 12 000, these were signed in most cases with the same specialized institutions as in.previous years.
A high degree of continuity is needed in this work and a yearly call for leaders with the possibility of frequent changes in contracts would be very disruptive and, due to the need for training and a period of introduction, inefficiencies.
Nevertheless the performance of the contracts is carefully appreciated and a call for contracts (on the basis of the call for interest recently made by the"Centre) will be launched in cases where it is considered that this performance is not satisfied. (b) Contracts for preparing new monographs describing the vocational education and training systems in the Member States (or for updating existing ones) are subject to the useful rules, i.e. a restricted invitation to tender is organised.
In the case of the monographs, this list is drawn up following consultation with members of the Management Board.
An exception to this rule was made during 1995 and 1996 in relation to monographs concerning the new Member States and the EEA countries, when it was thought more appropriate to take the decision directly following consultation with members of the Management Board.
As planned, the Centre launched a general call for an expression of interest for participation in networks and the performance of study contracts.
This was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C 214 of 16 July 1997) and the results of this call are now being processed.
17. Deals in complete transactions in relation to contracts in many cases deive from defective administrative procedures, particularly the failure of contracts to forward in time the necessary invoices for payment.
Delays were also involved sometimes in signing contracts, allowing work on them to begin only some months after the date initially planned which had knock-on effects.
In other cases appeals were due to the need for intent and time-consuming discussion between the contractor and Cedefop on the basis of the contractor's. draft report.
In cases in which the contracting institution may be co-funded the activity itself, or obtaining some funding from another source, Cedefop cannot always determine the timetable.
This is particularly so, when the price that Cedefop is paying is lower than the market might dictate for the work involved.
Nevertheless, Cedefop will try to avoid delays.
In the case of unreasonable reasons the Centre indicates to the contractors that these effectively serious reasons for them, as far as the prospects for future cooperation are concerned.
The new list of interested persons/institutions, which will be the result of the recent call for expression of interest, should enlarge the options available to the Centre for the future award of contracts and therefore make it easy to insert that contracts and their institutions therefore strictly with the rules and timetable laid down.
A business-like approach will be mainstreamed.
19. The Management Board notes the improvements in 1996 and considers that further progress is possible.
It will intensify its effects to that end.
The Centre has improved its procedure by adding to every quarterly drawing from the Commission given a detailed statement with respect to the current supply of means of payment and the total payments expected during the subject four months.
The difference between these shows the balance of the real demand and, as a result, a permanent exit cash balance will be avoided.
20. The Centre immediately initiated action after the audit of the Court of Auditors and is pressing for recovery.
The accounting records for recalling from the German financial authorities the value-added tax (VAT) paid in 1995 and 1996 by the Centre have been subject.
The Centre has made contact with the responsible tax authorities in Greece and has been informed in detail on the procedure and appropriate preparation of the records for recalling value-added tax
29. 12.97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/9 (VAT) paid in previous years.
In the mean time, the records-concerning the financial years 1995 and 1996 have been prepared and prepared to the authorities.
21. The Centre draws to mind that... the quickly refurbished temporal premises are not an optimal· solution (e.g. the available surface area is only +/- one third the size of the future new building),.. new needs area after Cedefop's relocation (partically, investment in the infrastructure for electronic equipment),.. none the initial agreement nor the Greek law is clear on who should bear such costs.
Legal advice confirmed the uncertainty.
The Centre had to make modifications to run operations efficiently.
The Centre recognizes that it would have been better to make arrangements beforehand on any additional investment.
The owner has taken note of these additional investments made by Cedefop and has shown a generic attitude in new issues (e. g. extra meeting facilities).
The Centre also will try to receive compensation in the setstlements at the end of the present rental contract.
23. The Centre agrees that the prepared time was very long, but is convinced that matters will now proceed rapidly.
The calendar for the coming period served by the Greek authorities is as follows: Calendar with main events and dates for Cedefop's new building Selection of the winner of the call for tender in the second round of tips Implementation of the structural work Foundation stone laid by Mr Pangalos, Foreign Affairs Minister Signing of the contract Estimated total time for completing the work Estimated completion of the project The Centre expects that the budget authority will lift the reserve in the 1997 budget and that the Centre will be able to complete with its contractual obligations vis-à-vis the Greek Government.
Hopefully, the progress will be substantial enough to pay the third installation before the end of 1997.
This would also be of importance because in the budget proposal of 1998 there is no request for another installation.
24...25. There are indeed many new staff members registered and several persons working in the Centre on different contracts on top of the table of posts.
The social measures related to the transfer came to an end (May 1997) and the Management Board will asses the staff situation at the end of 1997.
30 July 1997 In progress 6 September 1997 30 October 1997 460 calendar days 10 May 1999 at the latest 26. The expectations are that the results of this investigation will not have concerns for the Centre.
27. As explained, a new extensive call for interest has been understood with success.
28. This situation has been improving over the last years and this trend Hopefully will continue in 1997.
29. The Centre did its utmost, and will continue to do so, to ensure that it will have a high-quality new building and to obtain good value for good money.
The cost of the new building could be less than the initial estimates.
The prospects are positive (see paragraph 23).

In accordance with Article 1 (16) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 (3) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 ((4), the budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Administrative Board.
This liability included the drawing up and presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the financial provisions as provided for pursuant to Article 1 (52), (54) and (55) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 (3) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 (4).
3. The Court understood its audit in accordance with generally accepted international audit standards, in so far as they are applicable in the Community context and, as the case may be, carried out such tests of the accounting records and such other procedures as the Court may require in the circumstances.
4. In the opinion of the Court the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 1996 are reliable and the underlying transactions are, taken as a whole, legal and regular.
AUDIT OBSERVATIONS Introduction Background 5. The European Foundation for the Improvement in Living and Working Conditions (Dublin Foundation) was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 (5) as a satellite body of the European Community with the task of contributing 'to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge of this development'.
The Dublin Foundation communed operations in 1976.
Scope of the audit 6. The Court of Auditors has examined the accounts and financial management of the Dublin Foundation for the financial year 1996 in accordance with the provisions of the relevant accounts[6).
A review of the cooperation with the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao and Directorate-General V of the Commission in the area of health and safety was also carried out.
Financial data 7. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the financial statements of the Foundation.
Available approaches for the financial year 1996 estimated to ECU 13,8 million.
Commitments entered into gave rise to ECU 10,5 million in payments and ECU 3,1 million in carry-over to the financial year 1997, the balance of ECU 0,2 million having been cancelled.
Appropriations carried over from the previous year gave rise to ECU 2.9 million in payments and ECU 0.1 million in cancellations.
Table 3 attached to this report gives an analysis by title of the implementation of the commitments for the year and for those carried over from 1995.
Back to previous observations Separation of duties 8. There is still an inadequate separation of duties between the authority officer and the accounting officer (7), contravening Article 1 (15) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1949/93 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76. Impres account 9. Last year the Court recommended that the use of the impres account be limited to ongoing or small expenses, where the risk of irregularities is comparatively low.
At the time of the audit in April 1997 a written definition of ongoing and small expenses still had not been established by the Foundation in consultation, with the Financial Controller.
Transfer of commitments between Titles 10. The Court welcomes the fact that no transfers of commitments between Titles were made during 1996.
The Court has criticized such transfers in previous years (8).
Mission Expenditures 11. Some improvements have been made to ensure the controls and monitoring of the results of missions.
The Foundation should continue its effects so as to ensure that:
C 393/12 Γ Ε Ν Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12... for all missions a report setting the times of meetings, persons met and the results of the meeting is prepared.
The report should be reviewed by a senior member of staff and filed centrally, d, wherever possible, more than one meeting should be arranged during a mission to Brussels in order to avoid the same staff member going to Brussels on successful weeks, d, other means of communication, including tele to Brussels conference, should be seriously considered, especially when communicating with persons in Brussels already well known.
Study contracts 12. The audit team of the Court followed up last year's observation regarding contracts in the submission of work by contracts.
The minutes of the programme management meetings did not contain any evidence of a review of report deaths.
A summary of the information supplied by the Foundation during the audit is show in Table 4 and demonstrated the need for a formalization of followliup procedures.
Management health and safety Coordination with the Bilbao Agency 16. The European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao recommended its activities in September 1996.
"Health and safety" was in the Foundation's programme of work for 1996, but was replaced in the programme of work for 1997 with "Health and well welldbeing."
There is an urgent need for a clear and detailed M emorandum of Understanding (currently being negotiated) to be agreed on by both satellite agencies.
This should maximum cooperation and exclusive any overlap in activities.
17. Formal contacts already exist at administrative level, notably through both directors at attention to the other's Administrative Board meetings as an observer.
Links need to be extended to the research manager level in order to ensure full coordination.
Cooperation of the Foundation with DG V/F 18. Directorate F of DG V, 'Public Health and Safety at Work', makes use of some of the Foundation's research within this specialized field.
Whilst maintaining the present independence of the Foundation's Administrative Board, there is a need to make more effective to ensure that its output is as useful as possible to DG V/F in terms of content and timing.
DG V/F is unable to attend all meeting concerning specific study contracts.
It would therefore be useful to hold periodic meetings at which the whole range of studies which may concern DG V/F can be discussed.
Conclusion 19. There is an inadequate separation of duties duties duties accounting officer and authority officer (see paragraph 8).
20. The use of the impress account should be regularised (see paragraph 9).
21. Controls over mission expenditure and the monitoring of study contracts should be tightened (see paragraphs 11 and 12).
22. Cooperation and communication with the Bilbao Agency and DG V/F in the fields of 'Health and safety at work' and 'Health and well.being' should be investigated (see paragraphs 16 to 18).
Budget implementation and the expenditure account Transfer of commitments revenue and 13. The value of transfers of commitments between different budget lines in 1996 was ECU 1 366 000 (9.9% of commitments entered into the budget), down from ECU 1 494 000 (11.0%) in 1995.
Carry-overs and cancellations of commitments 14. Table 3 shows that the payment rate is 76 % for the account as a whole, but only 55 % for Title 3 Operating expenditure'.
This is in line with previous years and is due to the fact that studies are usually paid in three istalments over the period foreen in their contracts.
Revenue 15. The EU subsidies for the Foundation for 1996 was ECU 13,4 million.
The amount actually requested and received was ECU 12 895 632.
The funds were requested as required by the Council Regulations and in line with a cash flow forward, as previously recommended by the Court.

29. 12.97 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/17 REPLIES OF THE EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS Separation of duties 8. The Foundation would ask the Court to note that the two functions of authority and accounting officers are carried out separately by different individuals: a residual problem of separation of duties is limited to data input to the accounting system.
This problem will be resolved when the Foundation obtains delivery of a new system.
The Foundation is in contact with the Commission services with regard to the feeling of the application of the Commission's Sincom 2 system to the Foundation's accounting requirements. ~ - Imprest account 9. During 1996 the Foundation's use of the impress account was, in practice, in accordance with the recommendation of the Court, limited to ongoing or small expenses.
The Foundation, in June 1997 in consultation with the Financial Controller, established a written definition with regard to these expenses.
Mission expenses 11. In 1996, the Foundation further developed e existing procedures with regard to mission reports.
This process will continue and will corporate the suggestions of the Court.
The Foundation continues to accommodate the optimal number of meetings during a particular mission.
The Court's comments regarding missions to Brussels are, however, noted.
Following the successful completion of a pilot scheme during 1996 the Foundation has now installed a tele-conference facility.
It is intended to review the implementation of this facility at the end of a trial period at which time further decisions will be taken, based on a cost analysis, regarding the value of acquiring more extensive and sophisticated video-conferencing equipment.
Study contracts 12. Although the minutes of the programme management meetings have not registered the situation on specific contract dies, such discussions on each contract take place at every meeting and appropriate action is taken.
With regard to such recording the Foundation is now establishing an improved system for formalization of follow-up procedures in order to present a more realistic picture.of the situation.
Coordination with the Bilbao Agency 16. The memorandum of Understanding currently under consideration is regarded as a priority item by the Foundation.
The establishment of left at research-manager level has also communicated.
These will be intended in line with any increase in activities undertaken by the Bilbao Agency.
Cooperation of the Foundation with DG V/F 18. The Foundation.is very cognisant of the need for its output to be relevant to the work of DG V. The Commission is represented on the Foundation's Administrative Board by the Deputy-Director-General of DG V. Various forms of working relations have been established with the Directors of DG V, including mutual participation in working groups as appropriate.
Specificly through the office of the Director of DG V/F the Foundation has regular contacts with officials in the various units within DG V/F. Presentation of aspects of the Foundation's work to DG V officials is provided for within the Foundation's operational activities.
The Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work in Luxembourg to keep informed of the Foundation's programme and its results.
More generally there is a flow of relevant documentation from the Foundation to DG V •in relation to the results of the work programmes.
The Court's acknowledged that DG V/F is frequently impossible to attend meetings relation to specific study contracts is noted.
The Foundation is fully open to alternative proposals from DG V/F with regard to rendering of the Foundation's output.
C 393/18 I EN [Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEÄ, London) (Fincial year 1996), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 393/03) 1.1.
This report is available on the European Medicines Agency (EEC) website No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 (*).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products for the financial year 1996.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director in accordance with Article 57 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 (l).
His replies include the preparation and presentation of the accounts (2) in accordance with the internal financial provisions provided for in Article 57 (11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court of Auditors to audit these accounts.
The Court concluded its audit in accordance with generally accepted audit standards in so far as they are appropriate to the Community context.
It examined the account books and records and carried out such additional audit procedures as it considered necessary.
The financial statements concerning the financial year 1996 are related and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions as a whole are guaranteed.
FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budgets accounts 1.5.
The Agency's budget accounts do not enable the principle of the budget of the accounts to be guaranteed, as a posteriori modifications are possible and enable.
Further, the accounts do not make it possible to detect cases of spending in excess of available commitments.
The current system does not allow the authority officer to input accounting data (proposals for commitments and payment orders) to the computer.
These data are recorded by accounting officer in the accounts for the record (Temporary freezing) before being approved by the Financial Controller.
This practice does not provide accurate information on the accounts in real time.
As the Sincom 2 system, which is supposed to replace the present accounting system, is not yet operational, an alternative solution should preferably be sound without delay.
General accounts analytical 1.7.
The general accounts software that is currently used is inefficient for the Agency's needs and is separate from the budget accounts system.
Further, the Agency has no system of analytical accounts, which is however independent if one wishes to establish whether the scale of fees laid down by the Council (3) adequately covers the costs of evaluation.
Use of commitments.
1.8. The commitments carried forward from 1995 to 1996 totalled ECU 5.9 million.
Of this amount, ECU 1.7 million (29%) was cancelled.
ECU 0,9 million of 1995 claims made available for reuse but not used in 1996 were also cancelled. 1.9.
Only 79,6 % of current approaches (ECU 22,6 million before the SAB and ECU 17,9 million after a reduction made following the adoption of an amending budget) were implemented and 20,7 % were cancelled (ECU 4,7 million).
The main reason for this was the impossibility of recruiting staff in good time (only 65 % of the posts for which provision had been made); a second reason was the reduction in licence applications and in the corresponding studies.
1.10. The commitments carried forward from 1996 to 1997 totalled ECU 4.8 million.
Of this amount, ECU 1,7 million and ECU 2,8 million concern Titles II (administrative expenditure) and III (operational expenditure).
In the case of Title II, ECU 1,1 million concern purchases of equipment based on new technology.
In the case of Title III, ECU 1,3 million concern fees to be paid to the inspectors during examinations (started in 1996 and finished in 1997) and ECU 0,8 million was for Orphan drugs.

12.97 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/19 Imprest account 1.11.
Contrary to accounting principles, a loss of ECU 0,02 million in 1994 was listed under expenditure to be settled in 1995 and 1996. ^ Revenue; subsidies; own resources 1.12.
The total révenue actually collected, i.e. ECU 18,4 million, represents 81 % of the amount for which the budget initially provided.
The fees collected amounted to ECU 7 million.
Only 73 % of the amount initially provided for could be collected and checked.
The balance sheet shows ECU 0,9 million of fees due that have not yet been valid and established in accordance with Article 5 (3) of the Agency's Financial Regulation. 1.14.
In 1997, the Agency adopted a new computer system for revenue.
This system will be exhausted during the next Court audit.

In the absence of a commercial computing system which meets the requirements of the Financial Regulation and until the new SI2 system, developed by the Commission, which the Agencies are in the process of adapting to their needs, is available, the Agency is managing its budget accounts using Excel software.
This software uses that the information required for the sound management of the budget is always available and it provides the Agency's management with information which is relevant and up-to-date.
The software versions budget commitments, commitments, orders, frozen commitments and payments.
The existing system indicates cases spending in excess of available commitments.
The supporting document for each entry in the budget system is the document signed by the authority officer.
It is approved by the Financial Controller and is processed by the accounts department.
It is true that the Agency's system is not yet completely computerized and, because it does not retain in its memory changes to include, it does, in principle, allow changes to be made without any indication there appears in the general accounts.
However, it should be noted that all commitments, cancellations, payment orders, etc. are prepared and classified in accordance with the rules, the relevant supporting documents being placed in an annex.
In the new system it will not be possible to make ex post facto changes without there being any indication there.
Jake most of the Agencies, the EMEA expectations that the work on the SI2 project will be completed in 1997 and that the system will be made available.
The new system will allow the general accounts to better integrated with the budget accounts.
Together with the other Agencies, the EMEA issued an invitation to tender two years ago for compatible software; the result was disappointing.
The EMEA alternatives that the SI2 system, adapted to the needs of the Agency, will be available by the end of 1997.
1.7. On 5 February 1997 the Management Board adopted a report on the cost of operational activities, which was forwarded to the Commission.
The Agency is busy structure its accounts system so as to include analytical accounts.
In addition, a pilot programme for the electronic recording of activities has been started. 1.8.
The sum of ECU 0,9 million in 1995 proposals made available for reuse but not used in 1996 relates notably to Article 204 (fitting-out of premises).
As these approaches could not be transferred and as no significant fitting-out work was carried out in 1996, the sum in question was cancelled.
1.11. Article 5 of the Financial Regulation supports that expenditure for which authorisation reaches the Financial Controller no later than 31 December, and for which the corresponding payments are made no later than the following 15 January, will be entered in the accounts for the financial year which is coming to a close.
Following the imprecise interpretation of these provisions in 1994 a sum of ECU 16 915.22. was imputed to the imprest account.
Following discussions with the Court's auditors the sum in question was set in the 1997 accounts.
1.13. Even if, with more experience in the field, the Agency was able to improve its estimates of the volume of users to be received, taking account also of the seasonal nature of their submission, the Agency would still be no more able in the future than it is at present to form, one year in advance, exact estimates of the plans of the pharmaceutical industry and therefore of the amount which might be expected from fees.
These uncertainties mean that the Agency is required to pursue a cautious policy with regard to expenditure.
29. 12.97 ΓΕΝ~. Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/23 REPORT on the financial statements of the Office for harmonisation in the I external Market (OHI M, Alicante) (Fincial year 1996), together with the Office's replies (97/C 393/04) 1.1.
This report is added to the budget Committee of the Office for Harmonisation in the I external Market pursuant to Article 137 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 C.
The Court has examined the financial statements of the Office for Harmonisation in the I external Market for the financial year 1996.
The budget was implemented under the responsibility of the President of the Office in accordance with the requirements of Article 119 (2) (c) of Regulation (EC) No 40/94 (2).
His replies include the preparation and presentation of the accounts (3) in accordance with the internal financial rules, as provided for by Article 137 of Regulation (EC) No 40/94. Article 188c of the Treaty establishing the European Community requires the Court.of Auditors to audit these accounts.
The Court carried out its audit in accordance with generally accepted audit standards in so far as they are applicable in the Community context.
I t carried out tests on the account books and records and such' additional procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The main observations resulting from the Court's audit are set out in the second part of this report.
1.4. For the reasons indicated in paragraphs 1.8 to 1.12 (own revenue) the Court was unable to form an opinion as to whether the accounts understood the revenue show in the financial statements are dependent.
Subject to the above reservations, the financial statements for the financial year 1996 are dependent and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are, on the whole, assured.
Main observati ons IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET OF THE OFFI CE FOR HARMONI ZATI ON AND NTERNAL MARKET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budget accounts 1.6.
Although 1996 is the Office's third year of activity, the accounts department of the Office still does not have significant budget accounting software.
Monitoring the implementation of the budget is carried out with the aid of a tool which is not a real accounting system (changes may be made to enteres with no subject record of their having been made, absence of any link to the general accounts, etc.). 1.7.
The Office does not does any system of analytical accounting, which is, however,, which, for the purposes of establishing the real cost of services rendered.
Own revenue 1.8.
Before the entry into service, in May 1996, of the system set up to monitor the charges associated with the filling of trade marks (Euromarc), two alternative systems had been used temporally to monitor applications for trade-mark registrations.
The risk that is inherent in the transfer of data from these temporal systems to Euromarc is high and the Court was therefore impossible to form an opinion as to whether such transfers were complete.
The Office was not able to demonstrate that the Euromarc system was functioning according to the description it had given.
The Court is, therefore, not in a position to state with certainty that the reliability of the system is assured.
The new description draw up by the Office reached the Court too late for it to be able to carry out the additional work that was necessary to remove this unknown.
For reasons which are mainly due to the unwieldiness of Euromarc and the complexity of the THE regulations, long deals in dealing with applications were observed.
Some clients reported to the Office on this account.
Moreover, the accumulated delay prevented the entry of more than ECU 12.4 million of revenue out of a total of ECU 45.9 million in receptions.
The difference, i.e. ECU 33,5 million, was entered under liabilities and show on the balance sheet as 'advances from clients'.
Of this amount, ECU 4,7 million was made up of payments that could not be linked to the related trade-mark applications.
Bearing in mind that new payments arrive every day, these old transactions must be identified as a matter of urgency.
C 393/24 1 EN I Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 ACPC 1.12.
The Office's ACPC was not created until 1 April 1996.
Several contracts for which the opinion of the ACPC would have been required, had. already been approved by the Office on the basis of an Operating report' approved, in some cases, by a note from the legal department, concerning the regularity of the procedure followed.
Such notes can, under no circumstances, replace the opinion of the ACPC.
Appropriations carried over; cancellations; transfers 1.13.
Appropriations carried over to 1997 totalled ECU 14,5 million (total automatic carry-over), i.e. 44.8 % of the total of ECU,32,4 million of commitments for the financial year.
These measures carried forward originally in the large volume of trade-mark applications which had not been processed at the end of the year.
The total of current acquisitions which lapsed was ECU 5,6 million, i.e. 17,3 % of the acquisitions for the financial year.

29. 12.97 I EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/27 REPLIES OF THE OFFICE FOR HARMONIZATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET 1.4.
Own revenue The payment of the fees and charges associated with the filing and registration of a Community trade-mark is the final step in a linguistic procedure, which is laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993.
Between the time a trade-mark application is filed and the time the accounting charges are entered in the accounts there is usually an interval of two months, in the course of which the case is trailerted by at least three different types of staff.
The whole process is computerized and each category of staff involved is authorized to access the computer system which covers the duties for which they are responsible.
In order to be able to cover in a limited amount of time (two to three days) all the stages involved from receive of application to enter in the accounts of the charges, it is absolutely essential that the cases selected at the outside receive priority treatment.
This is possible providing two conditions are met: 1. that a single user is authorized, temporally and by way of exception, to have access to all computer systems required to complete all the stages, up to entry in the accounts, and 2. that the demonstration of the authorized procedure takes place in a test environment in order that there may be all the flexibility of use required without the production base being connected.
During the visit of the auditors in February 1997 it was not possible to carry out such a demonstration in the time available for technical reasons.
Measures have already been put in place to ensure that a complete presentation of the revenue payment system can be made during the auditors' visit which is planned for October 1997.
Budget accounts Like the other Agencies, the OHIM is awaiting the final version of the Sincom 2 budget accounting software.
This software ought to be available towards the end of 1997.
Once the OHIM receives the software, it will be brought into use over a period of a few months.
Analytic accounts The Office will start to establish analytical accounts for certain areas of activity at the starting of 1998, when it will have a successful broadcast and stable production base in certain sectors to be able to establish realistic standards.
Own revenue wn change of system While changing over to the final system for monitoring applications and charges, the Office verified extremely though that the data transferred were consistent.
Moreover, bank reconciliations confirmed the results of the transfer.
The Office therefore considers that the transfer was carried out correctly.
1.9 1.10.
System for the payment of charges See reply to paragraph 1.4.
Deal hi the identification/entry of payments On account of the large number of applications received in 1996 (43 000 rather than the 15 000 anticipated), the Office built up a certain backlog in 1996 in the entry of application charges.
The Office has now almost caught up with this backlog.
As regards the ECU 4,7 million made up of non-identified payments, the situation has been rectified since March 1997, as intended and explained to the Court's auditors.
At present, the time-lag between the reception of a cheque by the OHIM and its identification and transfer to the bank is six days.
C 393/28 ΓΕΝ~1 Official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12.97 1.13 ACPC The ACPC began operating as soon as the Office's Financial Regulation and the implementing rules applicable to the Financial Regulation, which government the composition of the ACPC, entered into force.
Before the creation of the ACPC the OHI M had no alternative but to follow the procedure which it did, namely to consult the legal department in respect of contracts exceeding a third of ECU 42 000, in order to ensure that the procedure was in accordance with the rules applicable to the conclusion of public contracts.
In the case of sizeable contracts, the OHI M was completed during this transitional period to use the contracts of the other institutions and of the Commission in particular, in order to benefit from the legal guarantee attached to such contracts and the economies of scale which necessarily result.
Appropriations carried over A relative large amount of commitments were carried over in 1996.
80% of the carry-overs in question related to procedural expenditure (searches/ translation/publications, etc.).
In accordance with Article 29 of the Financial Regulation, the Office must commit the procedural expenditure Articleing from Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade-mark the moment application charges are entered in the accounts.
This is effectively unavoidable expenditure, the implementation of which is directly linked to the collection of the application charges.
Clearly, during this start-up phase, taking into account the fact that the number of applications was much higher than anticipated (+ 280%), the discipency between the commitment of procedural expenditure and the actual implementation of the procedures in question is much greater than during normal operation.
This situation is progressive being regularized; in 1997 measures carried over in respect of procedural expenditure will be clearly less.
Lapsed acceptances/transfers of acceptances The 1996 budget was drawn up at the end of June 1994 and submitted to the budget authority in February 1995.
At that stage, there was nothing to suggest that the OHIM would be faced with such a number of trade-mark applications.
In June and September 1996 the OHI M informed its budget Committee of how the situation was developing, drawing its attention to the budget resolutions.
It should be noted that some of the.lapsed approaches come under Chapter 1 1 and relate in particular to heading 1 1 3 (Constitution or maintenance of pension rights for temporary staff) (ECU 1.31,000).
These approaches were entered in the budget at the request of the Commission in order to cover the employers' contributions to pensions payable to staff (it was said that this entry was contrary to the staff regulations).
I n the mean time, the Commission has indicated that no pension fund exists and that no amount is due as an employer's contribution.
As regards the other lapsed approaches, they are necessarily approaches relation to procedural expenditure for which it was impossible to make commitments in 1996 due to lock of time.
Building There is no lease contract between the Spanish authorities and the OHI M. for the later's occupation of its temporal seat at 20 Avenida de Aguilera.
There is, however, a document entered 'Acte de remise des clés du siège provisoire' (Deed of delivery of keys to the temporal seat), which was signed on 25 February 1994 by the Cosoami and the OHIM and which provides for the OHI M to Occupy the temporal seat until it is able to obtain the final seat.
Final seat The OHI M has taken note of the Court's observation concerning the availability of acceptances for the acquisition of the final seat.
Its budget Committee has, however, approved the acquisition of the first phase of the final seat by means of bank loan financing.
29. 12.97 I EN I Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/29 REPORT on the financial statements of the European Environment Agency (EEA, Copenhagen) (Fincial year 1996), together with the Agency's replies (97/C 393/05) 1.1.
This report is added to the Management Board of the European Environment Agency, pursuant to Article 13 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 of 7 May 1990 (i1).
The Court of Auditors has examined the financial statements of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 1996.
The Court carried out tests on the account books and records and also such additional audit procedures as it considered necessary in this context.
The observations set out in paragraphs 1.6 to 1.15 show that there are accounting practices in use at the Agency which are not consistent with the regulations.
There are also certainsums for which no justification could be given.
Subject to the above reservations, the Agency's financial statements for the financial year 1996 are - related and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions are, on the whole, guaranteed. of accounts.
No such rehabilitation was made during the financial year 1996.
Further, for the financial year 1996, such recovery was complicated by the consolidation of a substantial proportion of the general account entries (the various budget accounts were grouped into five major expenditure accounts in the general accounts; several non-budget entries concerning various credit or debit operations in respect of staff were also grouped together in a single account in the general accounts).
Another weight of this accounting system is the impossibility of checking a posteriori the level of acceptances during the year and thus of ensuring that available acceptances have not been exhausted.
1.8. Further, it was noted that a balance of approximately ECU 0,02 million was shown on the balance sheet (sundry accounts payable) for which the Agency was unable to provide the Court with the appropriate supporting documents (see consolidation problem mentioned in paragraph 1.6).
The Agency's budget accounts are still behindhand and could not provide the authority officers and the Financial Controller with the information they need if the former are to commit themselves legally in respect of third parties and the lateer to give his approval to the proposals for commitments that are subject to him.
For this reason, the Agency has had to set up a parallel system for monitoring the implementation of the budget so as not to exceed available commitments, as it did during the previous financial year (see report on the implementation of the 1995 budget), and to enable the authority officers to check at all times the level of commitment of the commitments for which they are responsible (failure to observe Articles 58 and 59 of the implementing provisions for the Commission's Financial Regulation, which also apply to the EEA, as the Agency has not adopted its own implementing provisions).
As the Sincom 2 system is unlikely to be available within a reasonable time, the Agency should preferably seek an alternative solution so as to have an effective accounting system at its disposition.
The methodology applied during the financial year 1996 completed neither with accounting rules nor with the MAIN OBSERVATIONS Implementation OF THE BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY (EEA, COPENHAGEN) FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1996 Budget and general accounts 1.6.
The accounts continue to be kept on two different computerized accounting systems: commercial software is used for the general accounts and another tool is used for the budget accounts.
This double system would require regular (at least monthly) reconciliations of the two sessions CONCERNING THE

C 393/62 1 EN u y official Journal of the European Communities 29. 12. 97 REPLIES OF THE EUROPEAN AGENCY FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH AT WORK The Court of Auditors visited the Agency for Safety and Health at Work from 12 to 16 May 1997 and carried out the audit for the financial year 1996.
The Director presented the objectives, programme and activities carried out, under way or planned.
In order to facilitate the work of the Court, the accounts and all relevant supporting documents were made available to the Court.
The personnel files and the contracts concluded were also presented.
The Court forwarded its preliminary comments with a view to drawing up the report on the financial statements of the Agency (financial year 1996) in its letter No 001594 of 15 July 1997.
The Agency, which welcomes the conclusions drawn in paragraph 1.4 of the Court of Auditors' draft report, in so far as the Court states that the financial statements for the financial year 1996 were dependent and, on the whole, the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions were guaranteed, would like to comment on the following paragraphs.
Paragraph 1.5.
The breakdown is complete because when the budget was being drawn up in 1995 it was not possible to plan in detail the budget requirements for the financial year 1996 and to include specific amounts; this was due to the fact that the Agency was in its start-up phase.
As a result, 'token entry' was entered in most chapters.
Paragraph 1.6.
It is true that there is no documentary evidence to show that the Administrative Board of the Agency approved the amendments to the initial budget for 1996.
In order to avoid a similar situation in the future it was agreed, at the meeting of the Bureau of the Administrative Board on 5 and 6 June 1997, that the minutes of meetings would include, in addition to the account of the discussions at meetings, a document explaining the formal decisions taken, in order to facilitate their restitution.
Paragraph 1.7.
The Agency does not indeed sites suitable software for its budget accounts and it is intended to use Excel.
In order to overcome this, the Agency has joined forces with the other Agencies to analyse the feasibility of an integrated software package such as the prototype of the beta version of SI2 provided by the European Commission.
Moreover, the Agency is following with interest the progress of the software being developed by Cedefop in Thessaloniki, which would appear to meet our needs as it is progresses a budgety and accounting management module as well as human resource management modules.
The Bilbao Agency will take a decision before the end of the year on the installation of one system or another, depending on the results of tests using both systems and the opinion of the superior bodies (Fincial Controller and Court of Auditors).
The Agency is doing all it can to improve the administration of its improve account and in September 1997 installed the RAI software with the assistance of the EMCDDA in Lisbon.
Paragraph 1.8.
In order to make good the deficit described by the Court of Auditors, the Agency acquired Cubic software in June 1997 which, the training of the competent staff having been completed, is already being used to keep the general accounts.
Paragraph 1.9.
It is true that the implementation of the budget for 1996 was adversely affected by the delay in the recruitment of the Director and staff for the administration unit of the Agency.
The said staff were only registered in May 1997, when the head of the unit and two assistants (a computer expert and a financial officer) took up their posts.
This means that the gradual introduction of all the systems necessary to ensure sound financial management (staff management, budget and accounting management, conclusion of contracts and general services) did not begin until after the said date.
Paragraph 1.10.
At the time of the negotiations on the seat of the Agency the Basque Government and the County of Vizcaya committed themselves to pay 75 % of the cost of the rent of the office building obtained by the Agency.
Despite the
29. 12.97 1 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 393/63 absence of an agreement signed between the Agency and the Basque authorities to this effect, the Basque Government has, as of September 1997, paid the Agency a subsidy of Pta 20 million and the County of Vizcaya has initiated the necessary procedures for the payment of its subsidy of Pta 10 million.
Paragraph 1.11.
In accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation, the Agency is doing all it can to make good the deficits pointed out by the Court of Auditors as regards public contracts and has recently submitted a draft Regulation for the creation of an ACPC for the opinion of the Financial Controller at the Commission and to the Court of Auditors for information; the Regulation is based, as far as possible, on the models adopted by the other Agencies.
As regards the contracts for the procurement of goods and services concluded by the Agency, notably since the audit concluded by the Court in May 1997, it should be pointed out that invitations to tender always been issued, even where the value of the estimated expenditure would have enabled private treatment.
The Agency would like to assure the Court that it is doing all it can to acquire, as quickly as possible, all the means necessary to carry out the improvements indicated by the Court of Auditors.
It would ask the Court to take account of the differences it has had in its start-up phase in respecting in full the rules dealing from Financial and other Regulations to which all its activities should be subject.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/5 INTRODUCTION 1.1.
In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (1), the European Court of Auditors is an external financing officer of the EU.
In this respect, the Court acts as an independent financial actor for the citizens of the Union, in particular by supporting the improvement of the financial management of the EU.
More detailed information on the Court's work can be found in its annual activity reports and in the annual implementation reports of the EU budget, as well as in the special reports, budget analyses and opinions on new or revised EU legislation or other measures affecting financial management (2).
Within the framework of its mandate, the Court shall be responsible for the annual accounts and accounts of all the institutions, agencies and other bodies of the Union on which they are based (3).
This report sets out the results that the Court has achieved during the preparation of the EU agencies and other Union bodies (hereinafter referred to as "the agencies') during the financial year 2017.
Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 of Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2 Part 2
EU AGENCIES Various types of agencies contribute to the formulation and implementation of EU policies in 1.4.
Agencies are separate bodies with their own legal personality, which have been established by a secondary act to perform specific technical, scientific or administrative tasks, to contribute to the shaping and implementation of the political activities of the EU institutions.
Many agencies are clearly visible and have a significant impact on important areas that are important for the daily life of European citizens, such as health, security, freedom and justice.
Chapter 3 provides a brief description of the tasks performed by each agency.
The report shall use the relevant agencies that can be found on the list at the beginning of that report.
There are three types of agencies: decentralised agencies, executive agencies and other agencies.
Their main features are described below.
The number of agencies increased over the years and in 2017 amounted to 41 agencies, as shown in Figure 1.1.
(1) Articles 285 to 287 (OJ C 326, 26.10.2012, p. 169-171).
(2) Available on the Court's website: www.eca.europa.eu (3) Three defence agencies (European Defence Agency, European Union Institute for Security Studies and the European Union Satellite Centre) financed by the Member States are not financed by the Court but by other independent external agencies.

The Commission's executive agencies shall have their seat, as shall the Commission, in Brussels or Luxembourg.
The decentralised agencies and other bodies are located across the EU and are located in 23 different Member States, as shown in the list of dead bodies and illustrations 1.2.
The seat of the Agency shall be adopted by the Council or by the Council and the European Parliament jointly.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/7 Illustration 1.2 The seat of the agencies in the Member States Source: European Court of Auditors.
The decentralised agencies address specific policy needs 1.8.
32 decentralised agencies (4) play an important role in the preparation and implementation of EU policies, in particular in the field of technical, scientific, operational and/or regulatory tasks.
This is primarily about meeting specific policy needs and strengthening European cooperation by strengthening the expertise and expertise of the EU and national governments.
The decentralised agencies have been set up for an indefinite period by a Regulation of the Council or of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The decentralised agencies shall operate under the control of the Management Board, which shall consist of representatives of the Member States, the Commission and certain agencies from other parties.
The Governing Board shall define the operational framework to be followed by the agencies, such as the multiannual and annual work programme, the budgets and the positions to be carried out under the responsibility of the relevant executive directors/directors.
Each decentralised agency shall be subject to a separate discharge procedure in respect of the implementation of the budget, which shall include staff, administrative and operational expenditure, and in most cases shall be given to the European Parliament and the Council (5).
(4) Cedefop, Eurofound, EEA, ETF, EMA, EMCDDA, CdT, PVO, EUIPO, EU-OSHA, FRA, EASA, EFSA, EMSA, Eurojust, ECDC, ENISA, ERA, Frontex, GSA, EPA, EFCA, ECHA, EIGE, ACER, Bd.ro BEREC, Europol, EASO, EBA, EIOPA, ESMA and eu-LISA.
5. Two self-financing agencies (CPVO and EUIPO) are subject to the discharge procedure by the Management Board.
DE C 434/8 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Commission executive agencies for EU programmes by 1.10.
Six Commission executive agencies ((6) have been entrusted with executive and operational tasks related to one or more Union programmes and their duration is limited in time.
They have been established by a Commission Decision and operate under the supervision of a steering committee established by the Commission.
Their work shall be based on multiannual and annual work programmes drawn up and implemented under the responsibility of the Executive Director.
They are subject to individual discharge procedures by the European Parliament and the Council in respect of their own budgets.
Unlike decentralised agencies, their budgets cover only personnel and administrative expenditure, while all the operational expenditure they cover comes from the Commission's budget and therefore forms part of the overall discharge granted to the Commission.
Therefore, the budget of the executive agencies corresponds only to a very small part of the budget that they have actually implemented.
Other institutions have specific tasks 1.11.
The other three entities are the EIT, the Euratom Supply Agency and the SRB.
The EIT in Budapest is an independent, decentralised EU institution, which uses resources in the fields of science, the economy and education to strengthen the Union's innovation by providing financial support.
The Institute was established by the European Parliament and the Council for an indefinite period.
It shall be managed by the Director and supervised by the Management Board and shall be subject to a separate discharge procedure by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Euratom Supply Agency in Luxembourg was established by the Council for an indefinite period in order to support the objectives of the Treaty on the support of the European Atomic Energy Community.
It shall be subject to the discharge procedure by the European Parliament and the Council.
The Advisory Committee of Member States shall assist the Euratom Supply Agency in the performance of its tasks by issuing opinions and providing analyses and information.
The Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency shall act under the supervision of the Commission.
The SRB is a central resolution authority in the Banking Union and is based in Br.ssel.
The SRB's task is to organise the restructuring of the banks at risk of bankruptcy, which has the least impact on the real economy, the financial system and the public finances of the participating Member States and which goes beyond the task.
The SRB shall be re-registered by its chairman, who shall also act as contract staff.
The Chairperson of the SRB shall be subject to a separate discharge procedure by a committee which shall appoint the members of the national resolution authorities of the participating Member States.
The agencies are financed from different sources and under different actions of the MFF 1.15.
The total budget of all agencies (except SRB) in 2017 amounted to EUR 3.5 billion (2016: EUR 3.4 billion), representing around 2.7% of the total EU budget for 2017 (2016: 2.4 %), as illustrated in Figure 1.3.
The agencies that recorded the highest increase in funds in 2017 are the GSA and the EIT, financed under sub-heading 1a of the MFF (7) (competitiveness of growth and jobs), as well as Frontex, EMA and EASO, financed under sub-heading 3 of the MFF (security and citizenship).
In 2017 the SRB budget of EUR 6.6 billion (2016: EUR 11.8 billion) of 8.
It shall consist of advisers paid by credit institutions to the Single Resolution Fund.
(6) INEA, REA, EACEA, ERCEA, Chafea and EASME.
(7) The EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020.
(8) The 2016 budget consisted not only of contributions from credit institutions to the Single Resolution Fund for 2016 but also of contributions from the 2015 national resolution authorities to the Fund only in January 2016.
Therefore, the general budget for 2017 is much lower than the budget for 2016 (EUR 6.6 billion against EUR 11.8 billion).
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/9 1.17.
The budget of decentralised agencies and other bodies shall cover personnel, administrative and operational expenditure, while the executive agencies shall cover programmes financed by the Commission budget and their own budgets (total of approximately EUR 241 million) shall cover only personnel and administrative expenditure.
The Commission's operational expenditure incurred by six executive agencies amounted to around EUR 6.8 billion in 2017, representing more than twice the total budget of all other agencies, without the SRB.
Figure 1.3 Sources of funding for the Agency in 2017 Source: EU budget for 2017 and Agency budget for 2017, data collected by the European Court of Auditors.
Most agencies, including executive agencies, are almost fully funded by the EU budget.
The other agencies are fully or partially financed by fees and fees, as well as direct contributions from participating countries, such as Member States, EFTA States, etc., from the EU budget of around EUR 2.5 billion. The EU budget includes EUR 1 billion from fees and fees and direct contributions from participating countries.
Figure 1.4 shows that the agencies, depending on the amount of contributions received from the EU budget, have been decoupled from the EU budget.

As regards staff, the agencies had, by the end of 2017, around 11 000 employees [9] (2016: 10 300), representing around one sixth of the total staff employed by the EU institutions and agencies.
Figure 1.6 shows that all human resources have been compensated for by the agencies.
9. Staff shall include officials, temporary staff and contract staff and seconded national experts.

EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/13 The network of EU agencies supports the cooperation of agencies and communication with stakeholders 1.21.
The EU agency network (EUAN) was set up by the agencies as a forum for the agency's cooperation in order to increase the visibility, identification and effectiveness of the agencies, as well as their effectiveness and added value.
EUAN shall act on the basis of the priorities set by the Agencies in the five-year strategic programme 2015-2020 and on the basis of the annual work programmes setting out the possibilities and expected results.
The important role of EUAN is to ensure effective communication between agencies and stakeholders In particular, it is for the EU institutions to ensure effective communication between agencies and stakeholders, in particular for the EU institutions, in particular.
THE COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S COURT'S Annual Financial Statements and Financial Statements 1.22.
In Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court (a) discussed the annual accounts of all the agencies containing the annual accounts[10] and the accounts of the implementation of the budget [11] of the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and (b) of the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and of the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017 of 31 December 2017.
On the basis of the results of the Court's work, the Court shall report to the European Parliament and the Council or to the other discharge authorities referred to in Chapter 3 of this report to each agency on the reliability of the accounts and on the legality and regularity of the results of the underlying work.
Article 208 (4) of the EU Financial Regulation [12] provides that the annual accounts of the 32 agencies that received assistance from the EU budget have been drawn up by independent external experts.
The Court examined whether the results of this analysis were reliable, whether they were in line with international audit standards and whether they were in line with international audit standards and whether they were in line with their own opinions.
The Court considers that the identified risk is 1.25.
In order to achieve sufficient security, the Court has designed its activities in such a way as to identify the main risks identified, and, as a general rule, to the extent that the agencies are cleared, there is a small risk 1.26.
In general, the Court considers that the risks associated with the surplus accounts for all the agencies are low.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."""""""""

The number of significant errors identified in the past was low.
Title I (Personal expenses) 1.28.
The management by the PMO (Commission's offices for the identification and management of individual applications) is subject to the Court's review in the context of its in-depth evaluation of administrative expenditure.
No significant errors have been identified in recent years in terms of staff expenditure.
However, if agencies have to employ additional large-scale workers in the short term, there is an average to high risk of the legality and regularity of recruitment procedures.
(10) The annual accounts shall include an overview of the financial situation, financial statements, financial statements, a table of changes in net value as well as a summary of the reasonable accounting bases as well as other depreciations.
(11) The budget implementation reports shall include an overview of revenue and expenditure, summing up revenue and expenditure forecasts, as well as an illusion.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).
DE C 434/14 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Title II (administrative expenditure) 1.29.
Contracts for different services (as the number of employees increases in the IT sector) include complex rules and procedures for the award of public contracts, and agency administration sometimes does not provide satisfactory transparency and does not provide the best quality of contracts.
The serious errors in the award of contracts affecting payment conditions were, at regular intervals, one of the main errors in the award of public contracts to which the Court has infringed the Court's opinions and observations.
Title III (operational expenditure) 1.30.
There are small or high risks.
This depends on the type and type of operational expenditure of the agency concerned.
Overall, the risks associated with the award of the contract are comparable with the risks associated with Title II, but the risks associated with it may be higher.
As regards grants paid under Title III of the budget, the previous work concluded that, despite the overall improvement, the Agency's controls were not always fully effective.
There is an average risk in terms of cost-effectiveness of budgetary expenditure, which has been established mainly in the field of IT and public procurement.
The Court has already set out its findings on different IT countries in agencies, weaknesses in the management of IT projects and procurement procedures which did not ensure the best quality and quality.
Overall, a large number of small agencies (see illustrations 1.4 and 1.6) equipped with their own administrative structures and procedures pose a risk of administrative efficiency.

DE C 434/16 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 INTRODUCTION 2.1.
This Chapter provides an overview of the results of the annual work of the Agency carried out by the Court in 2017 and of further preparatory work related to the agencies carried out by the Court in 2017.

In general, for the Agency's annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017, and for the revenue and payments underlying those annual accounts, the Court recognises the positive results of the previous years.
The Court issued inconsistent opinions on the annual accounts of all the agencies.
The Agency's annual accounts as of 31 December 2017 and the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 as well as the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 and the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017 and the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 as well as the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017 and the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017 and the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 and as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017, the Agency's accounts and accounts as of 31 December 2017 as well as the Agency's accounts as of 31 December 2017 and the financial statements as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017 as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2017, the Agency's financial statements and financial statements as of 31 December 2017, shall be, in all relevant respects.
In order to highlight the facts, the basis is to understand the annual accounts 2.5.
With regard to EASO, the Court stressed that the human situation of WASO B has deteriorated significantly.
B there is currently no administration to fill many job vacancies.
Overall, in the current staff situation, it has contributed significantly to the further development of the situation in B in adulthood.
In the case of the SRB, the Court stressed that the contributions to the Single Resolution Fund are calculated on the basis of the information provided by the credit institutions to the Committee on the national resolution authorities.
However, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework to ensure compliance with this information.
The Court also found that the method for calculating the contributions laid down in the legislation is very complex, which involves a risk of accuracy.
For reasons of confidentiality, the Committee cannot disclose the data of credit institutions used for the calculation of credit institutions under the Fund, which reduces transparency.
As regards ECHA, the Court stressed that the Agency is partly financed by itself and that it is financed by each undertaking applying for the registration of chemicals, in accordance with REACH, by any undertaking applying for the registration of chemicals, is the undertaking referred to in REACH[14].
The Agency shall calculate and submit personal data on the basis of information provided by undertakings at the time of the application.
The Agency's ex post studies have shown that major corrections are necessary, the total amount of which was not known at the end of 2017.
This statement points to the limitations of the system based to too much on the self-assessment of applicants.
With regard to GSA, the Court stressed that one of the tenderers contested the outcome of the tendering procedure in favour of one of the most important publications of the Agency (a framework agreement worth EUR 1,5 billion).
As regards the two London agencies (EMA and EBA), the Court pointed out that they would leave Great Britain in 2019 and that their annual accounts, together with their values, were drawn up on the basis of the information available at the time of their signature.
The Court also pointed out the impact of the lease agreements currently in force in London and the impact that the United Kingdom's exit from the EU could have on the impact of a decrease in income.
Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1).
Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/17 Incomplete decisions on the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the annual accounts of all agencies 2.12.
For all agencies, the Court issued inconsistent decisions on the legality and regularity of the annual accounts for the year ending 31 December 2017.
The Court found that revenue was legal and regular in all material respects.
Incoherent decisions on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the Agency's annual accounts (except EASO) 2.13.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has issued inconsistent rulings on the legality and regularity of the annual accounts in respect of the payments underlying the accounts by 31 December 2017.
The Court assessed that payments were legal and regular in all material respects.
Since the rules are systematic, the internal control system seems unacceptable.
The cumulative error resulting from irregular payments shall be at least EUR 7,7 million or 10,3% of the total payments made by B unlawfully in 2017.
On other points, paragraphs 2 to 15 address specific issues.
As regards other issues, attention should be paid to the reader's attention to important issues which are neither presented nor presented in the accounts nor which concern the legality and regularity of income and payments.
With regard to the EIT, the Court concluded that, at the end of the transitional period, the initial refunds for the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (CIPs) were increased.
In addition, two KICs have included several new opportunities in the bottlenecks.
For one KIC, this led to a significant change in the initial grant decision.
Significant changes may affect the equal treatment of KICs and do not comply with the Financial Regulation.
In the case of Frontex since 2014, the Court has repeatedly noted that the cooperating countries will often not provide sufficient evidence of the expenditure to which they relate.
This has also been maximized thanks to what happened earlier.
In response to the Court's 2016 recommendation, Frontex is currently introducing a simplified cost recovery model.
With regard to EBA, EIOPA and ESMA, the Court has indicated that its budgets are partly financed by the European Union and partly by direct contributions from the supervisory authorities and/or supervised bodies of the EU Member States.
The UK decision to leave the EU may reduce the income of residents in the future.
As regards GSA, the Court has informed that the Agency operates both the Galileo Security Centre (GSMC) and the Galileo ground stations in the United Kingdom, which should be relocated.
As regards CdT, the Court pointed out that several agencies were increasingly using internal or other alternative translations, which meant that the Centrum capaticite had not been fully used.
Moreover, at European level, there is a duplication of expenditure on the development of translation systems and running costs.
In December 2016, the body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (B.R.E.C.C.T.) commissioned the CdT to translate four calls for expressions of interest to draw up a reserve list, even though all the posts approved by the Budget Office were filled in the employment plan of B.R.
The Court considered that the translation contract awarded in December 2016 was not justified.
The payments made under this order under M in 2017 amounted to 2,5% of the budget in 2017.

The Court's observations cover a number of subjects 2.22.
The Court has submitted 145 comments on 37 agencies in order to highlight important issues and identify areas for improvement.
The comments set out in Chapter 3 are summarised below.
For EASO 2.23 there are serious risk deficiencies.
In the case of EASO, the Court drew attention to the high risks related to the nature of its activities and to the external challenges related to the migration crisis.
This risk has not been addressed through a robust governance structure and effective controls, resulting in a number of significant infringements.

Moreover, B does not have an internal audit body or a legal entity in B, and the legal documents are not systematically verified.
Almost all services that were provided on the basis of public procurement procedures or recruitment procedures have been systematically exposed to serious risks related to the determination of B's needs for services, the development of specifications, the choice of the type of procurement, the assessment and procurement procedures, the modification and loss of Vertragen, the development of specifications and the assessment of the services provided, etc.
These measures are contrary to the principles of competition, transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/19 Progress towards a more harmonised IT country 2.26.
The Agency's activities are extensive and require appropriate, sometimes tailored, IT activities.
Nevertheless, based on the same legal framework, based on key operational and administrative issues, based on the same legal framework and therefore, their procedures may change and appropriate IT resources may be used to support these procedures.
While the agencies have made significant progress in the implementation of the budgetary and budgetary accounting systems in this respect, the Court continued to apply a number of IT systems in its 2016 synthesis report on the Agency's work on human resources management and procurement management and procurement management.
Agencies are seeking to further harmonise information systems in these areas, in particular in order to increase cost efficiency, reduce internal control risks and strengthen IT management.
A number of progress was made in human resources management in 2017, when 20 agencies agreed with the Commission on the use of the SYSPER II tool, which will contribute to the creation of a more unified IT country in this area.
On 1 January 2019....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

In this fragmented IT country, the use of electronic tools to purchase e-procurement (e-procurement) would also be an important step towards a more harmonised IT framework among the agencies.
All EU institutions and agencies shall set up and implement all EU institutions and agencies, as far as possible, as far as possible, as regards the submission, storage and processing of data that are transmitted under grant and procurement procedures, including as far as they are transmitted to applicants, candidates and tenderers, within the common field of electronic data exchange in this field (15), (16).
While the Financial Regulation and the Framework Financial Regulation on Public Procurement do not set a deadline for the introduction of electronic public procurement, the EU Public Procurement Directive adopted in 2014[17] provides for the use of electronic public procurement in EU Member States by 2018 and the EU Directive on electronic invoices, adopted in 2014[18], and the EU Directive on electronic invoices[18], should allow public institutions to receive electronic invoices by 2019.

DE C 434/20 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 2.29.
All agencies publish their calls for tenders in electronic form by TED (Tenders Electronic Daily), in the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union (Official Journal of the European Union) on public procurement. In addition, the Commission launched electronic invoicing tools (2010), the electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the European Union (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015). Most agencies introduced electronic invoicing and electronic invitation to tender in electronic form by the end of 2017.
Improve IT consulting and project management within EMA and eu-LISA in IT consulting and project management within EMA 2.30.
As part of the preparatory work carried out in the previous year, the Court examined how the Agency manages advisory services.
Using consulting companies has led to critical dependence on external expertise.
The Court also stated that the control of the development and implementation of the projects was insufficient and that the projects had had serious distortions and increased costs.
During 2017, the Agency has taken a number of steps to improve the situation.
However, it will take time to reduce the Agency's critical distance from consulting firms, and the effects of the actions will only be visible over the years.
IT consulting and project management services within eu-LISA 2.32.
The Agency shall mainly use advisory services related to IT projects due to its nature.
In 2017, the Agency's IT projects were implemented within the framework of the financial and time framework.
The Agency shall use the outsourcing model to develop and implement IT projects, where approximately 90% of the relevant work is used by three contractors.
Although IT projects are owned and controlled by the Agency, the model in which development projects are contracted in such a way by such sensitive IT systems carries a risk of agreement by contractors.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/21 2.34.
At the same time, a small number of employees in operating branches pose a risk to business continuity.
The aim of public procurement is to ensure competition between economic operators and to ensure the most favourable purchase market, while maintaining transparency, objectivity and coherence on the basis of the existing legal framework.
The Court found that 14 agencies (B stated that EASO, EASO, EEA, EIGE, EUIPO, ERA, EASA, FRA and SRB) operate in the field of public procurement, mainly with regard to services that pose risks to the optimal use of funds.
Among the most identified stakeholders is the imbalance between price and quality aspects in relation to the award criteria, the sub-optimal structure of framework agreements, the use of framework agreements that allow service contracts whose description and/or price were not sufficiently precise and the use of indirect services.
Most of the agencies examined the effects of Brexit 2.36. On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom informed the European Council of its decision to leave the European Union (Brexit).
Unlike most other agencies, agencies (ACER, B Vietnam, EPA, ENISA and EU-OSHA) have not carried out a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of Brexit on their organisation, organisation, organisation and organisation.
Employment notices can be published on EPSO's website on page 2.37.
Most agencies (ACER, Cedefop, EPA, Chafea, EASA, ECA, ECA, EIGE, EIOPA, EIT, EMA, EMCDDA, EMSA, ENISA, ESMA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, Frontex, GSA and SRB) publish posts on their websites and social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
The publication on the EPSO website would allow transparency and publication and would allow citizens to familiarise themselves with employment notices in all European institutions and institutions.
The main reason why the agencies call for EPSO is that EPSO requires the publication of a notice of employment in all the official EU languages, which entails a high cost of translation.
Less comments on the legality and regularity of payments 2.38.
The number of comments on the legality and regularity of payments has increased to eight (2016: 11), which clearly indicates that the agencies continue to comply with the legal framework, in particular with the provisions of the Financial Regulation, the Framework Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations.
In recent comments in recent comments on procurement procedures (EASO, EASA, EIGE and Frontex) on recruitment procedures (EASO, Cedefop and Frontex).
The budget has improved 2.39.
Budget appropriations allocated for a given year under the Financial Regulation may be carried over to the following financial year under certain conditions (19).
Although the Financial Regulation does not set ceilings for such measures, given the multi-annual nature of such measures, given that the revenue from these measures is largely justified, the revenue from these measures may, however, be to a large extent contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness.
It is apparent from Figure 2.4 that the Court has recorded high revenues among many agencies in 2017 and in previous years.

The Court also concluded that two agencies (Frontex and EUIPO) of previous years had cancelled budgetary appropriations.
This indicated that there was too much financial expenditure, in particular from the public administrations of the Member States and other cooperating countries.
The accounting system of 2.42 could still be improved.
During this work, the Court also examined the Agency's accounting principles, which play an important role in the preparation of the annual accounts.
According to the Financial Regulation, each agency has its own account, which means that it accounts for 37 accounts for 2 % of the EU budget in total.
The accounting officer's main tasks are payments, receipt of income and recovery of claims, drawing up and presenting financial statements, drawing up and drawing up financial statements, setting up and approving invoicing systems and receipt of cash.
In order to increase efficiency in 2012, the Commission's accounting officer asked all agencies to delegate the clearing function to it on the basis of the contract.
The first agency to adopt this proposal was CEPOL in 2014.
Only three other agencies (GSA, B.4ro BEREC and ACER) joined this programme by the end of 2017.
The hierarchic status of the agency's staff may affect its independence.
In particular, the accounts should be independent of the persons (subjects) empowered to make commitments, to take legal commitments and to make payments.
This concerns a total of 13 agencies (CdT, EACEA, EASA, EASME, EEA, EFSA, EIOPA, EMA, EMCDDA, ERA, EU-OSHA, Eurofound and FRA).
The appointment and tomorrow's accounting evaluation, inter alia, fall within the competence of the Management Board.
The Financial Regulation should ensure that the Agency's accounts function consistently (approval).
While the validation of invoicing systems in most agencies is ongoing, the Court concluded that the systems of invoicing in seven agencies (ACER, B at BEREC, EPA, EASME, EIT, EMA and GSA) require major changes in the context of timely reorganisation.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/23 Illustration 2.5 State of the agency's disagreement and re-approval of invoicing systems Source: European Court of Auditors on the basis of information provided by the agencies.
Three agencies (EASO, PVO and REA) have not documented procurement, grant and recruitment procedures.
Three agencies (ACER, EIT and Frontex) have identified internal control during the implementation of the emergency standard.
In the case of disasters that have led to disasters, these factors may pose a serious risk to the maintenance of the business, as the data may be lost irreversibly.
The agencies continue to monitor the findings of previous years 2.47.
Where appropriate, the Court has informed the Court of the progress of the agencies' actions in response to the previous years.
Figure 2.6 shows that corrective actions related to 170 comments that have not yet been implemented at the end of 2016 have been completed or completed in most cases.
Of the 13 outstanding comments, the corrective actions required for the three comments were not the subject of scrutiny by the Agency.

The Court provides OLAF with information on fraud committed by fraud... 2.48.
OLAF shall then be required to establish and follow these issues, where appropriate in cooperation with national judicial authorities.
In 2017, the Court found three cases of fraud which it had committed by reporting to OLAF.
The Court shall provide the Commission with information on the reports of the Internal Audit Service (IAS) and the external evaluation reports 2.49.
The Court also referred to the IAS external evaluation reports for information purposes and the external evaluation reports carried out on behalf of the Commission.
26 IAS reports were drawn up in 2017 and in nine cases an external evaluation of the Agency was carried out.
The Court has not examined the relevant evaluation or evaluation procedures.

In 2017, the Court carried out a quick analysis (20) of the way in which the European Union institutions and agencies implemented their commitment to reduce the number of employees employed in their offices by 5% in 2013-2017 (the agencies in 2014-2018).
The Court found that the agencies implemented a 5% reduction in staff, albeit with some delays.
In some decentralised agencies with traditional tasks, the number of employees has been reduced by 8.9%, while in some decentralised agencies and executive agencies with new tasks and tasks, the number of employees has increased by 19.9% and 42.9% respectively.
Illustration 2.7 shows that there are increasing percentage changes in positions in all institutions, bodies and agencies.

The Single Committee on Restructuring and Restructuring (RSB) based in Br.ssel was set up in August 2014 as part of a political response to the financial crisis.
The Committee's task is to liquidate banks that are at risk of bankruptcy that fall within its remit.
In January 2017, SRB f..r. 139 banks, including 130 banking groups, were still in possession (21).
The consultation (22) examined whether the Committee was able to manage banks effectively, in particular with regard to the quality of the resolution plan of individual banks and whether the Committee was adequately prepared to meet the legal requirements of the resolution plan and whether it had sufficient human resources to carry out its tasks.
The Court has identified shortcomings in all these areas, but since the creation of the Committee, as a completely new structure, has been a major challenge, the shortcomings should be seen in this context.
The Court has made a number of recommendations to the Committee to draw up recommendations on resolution and to improve its principles and guidelines and to increase the number of employees and improve human resources management procedures.
(21) On 1 January 2018, this figure fell to 127 banks and 119 banking groups.
(22) Special Report No 23/2017: ăSingle Committee on Restructuring and orderly winding-up: First steps have been taken on the road to the Banking Union, but this is still a long way to go and..., published on 19 December 2017.
DE C 434/26 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 Court Special Annual Report on contingent obligations arising from the implementation of the Single Committee on Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring and Structured Restructuring 2.54.
In accordance with the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (23), the Court must report on all conditional liabilities arising from the exercise by the Committee, the Council and the Commission of the tasks arising from this Regulation.
As of 31 December 2016, the Committee's conditional commitments resulting from earlier contributions amounted to EUR 842 million, which increased to EUR 1 420 million on 30 September 2017.
In 2016, the Council did not start the resolution of banks and therefore in 2016 there was no conditional obligation related to resolution and orderly resolution and orderly resolution.
On the date on which the Court's report on contingent liabilities which resulted from the performance of the Committee's tasks was published in 2016, 90 legal proceedings against the Committee were initiated in the context of the resolution decision adopted in June 2017 in respect of Banco Popular Espa.ol S.A. by the end of October 2017 and 46 complaints were brought before the Board of Appeal of the SRB.
The Commission and the Council were informed of 26 proceedings brought before the General Court in connection with the resolution decision mentioned above.
Other special reports by the Court concerning one or more agencies 2.55.
In addition to the progress reports specifically intended for the Agency, in 2017, the Court prepared a number of special reports and studies on the implementation of EU policies for a number of agencies (see Figure 2.8).

DE C 434/28 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 of the EU AGENCies' replies The Agencies confirm the Court's positive conclusions on the reliability of its annual accounts and the underlying accounts.
The network could express its concern that, given that the Commission in Sysper only offers them a basic module package, the agencies will still need to use separate assessment, teleworking, slip time and staff reporting tools.
Therefore, the IT sector in the field of human resources management will only become partially more coherent, and even much less, than in the case of the Commission.
I also want the possibility of introducing a common possibility of using services to support recruitment procedures that are currently not covered by Sysper.
In the area of public procurement, over the last two years, there has been a strong development towards the harmonisation of electronic tools.
This development began in 2015/2016, when, in cooperation with DG DIGIT, the electronic procurement tools developed by DG DIGIT were developed.
Since then, this series of electronic modules for all stages of the public procurement cycle has become increasingly the standard to which the agencies apply.
In 2018, this trend continued to change when new modules were introduced into the electronic submission of applications and the ABAC LCK module and the agencies were available.
Agencies are gradually aiming to use their own isolated tools, which are quick, sometimes less rapid, but regardless of how quickly this development will take place, this trend does not stop itself.
In practice, it is difficult to achieve the proposed efficiency gains, which can be achieved through the implementation of accounting tasks for the European Commission.
The required work depends not only on the balance of the budget but also on the fact that the financial statements must be completed in a narrow timeframe at the beginning of each year.
Experience shows that where additional funding under delegation agreements requires more than one annual financial statement package, almost twice as many employees as required, although less than one financial statement package is required for delegation agreements (and less than twice as many employees for delegation agreements under delegation agreements).
Each agency should therefore assign an accounting task to the accounting team to show that each agency should continue to carry out its tasks.
As long as possible, possible staff savings are not in line with full-time jobs.
In addition, the annual budget still needs to be paid.
For this reason, only a few agencies have decided to delegate this task to the Commission.
The Network would like to stress that to date no investigation or risk assessment has been carried out that could justify the conclusion that the non-compliance of the authorising officer could be justified if he were directly subject to the authorising officer and not to the authorising officer authorised.
Some agencies have decided to adopt an invoice card which contains, inter alia, reporting provisions which may be necessary for the Management Board.

We have consulted International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and International Standards on Auditing (IFAC) and International Standards on Auditing (IFOSAI).
Our obligations under these standards are further described in the ăResponsibility section in our report.
We are independent in compliance with the Code of Ethics for the professional contacts of the International Standards of Ethics for Accountants (IESBA Code) and with the relevant requirements for professional behaviour and other requirements for professional behaviour in accordance with these requirements and with the IESBA Code.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and adequate to serve as the basis for our judgment.
Responsibilities of the management and management and of the supervisor 3.1.2.
In accordance with Articles 310 to 325 TFEU and the Agency's financial rules, management is responsible for drawing up and presenting the annual accounts on the basis of internationally recognised accounting bases, on the basis of Articles 310 to 325 TFEU, the public sector and on the basis of the legality and regularity of the accounts.
This includes designing, establishing and maintaining internal control structures which are necessary for the preparation and presentation of annual accounts which are free from material or unintentional false presentation.
The management of the agencies is the ultimate responsibility for the legality and legality of their annual accounts.
In drawing up the annual accounts, the management shall be responsible for assessing the Agency's ability to further develop its business, for matters relating to the further development of its business, for specifying, insofar as this is not related, insofar as this is not appropriate, the application of the accounting principle for further development of its business, except where the management intends to either terminate or terminate its business or there is no realistic alternative.

Our objective is to ensure sufficient security, whether the Agency's annual accounts are free from material false presentations, whether they are justified and correct or not, and whether the Agency's accounts are free from material inconsistencies and whether they are justified and correct or not, and whether the Agency's accounts are justified and correct, on the basis of our assessment whether the agencies are justified or not, and whether they are legal and orderly or legal or not.
Incorrect presentations and understanding may be intended or unintentional and may be considered relevant if they can be, individually or jointly, expected to affect the economic decisions made by users on the basis of this Financial Statement.
3.1.6.
As regards revenue, we are investigating whether the agencies have received revenue from the Commission or the cooperating countries, and, where appropriate, we are assessing their procedures for raising revenue and other revenue.
3.1.7.
As far as expenses are concerned, we are investigating whether expenses have been paid, registered and accepted.
Advances shall be paid after proof that the measure is used in accordance with the rules and the Agency shall accept the evidence by clearing the advance in the same year or in the same year or in the same year at the same time.
3.1.8.
In consultation with ISA and ISSAI, we retain mandatory responsibility throughout the process and maintain a critical attitude.

If we conclude that there is significant uncertainty, we will be obliged to draw attention to the information contained in the financial statements in the financial statements or, where that information is not adequate, to change our opinion in the financial statements.
We draw conclusions on the basis of evidence to support the conclusions obtained before the date of the contract notice.
We are responsible for instructions, monitoring and monitoring.
EN 3.1.9.
The exchange of information with the Management Board includes, inter alia, the planned scale and the planned time structure and the relevant arrangements, including any relevant information in the internal control system, which we are aware of our work.
3.1.10.
We are based on the facts on which we shared information with the agencies, on the most important facts on which the financial statements of the current period were based, and which are particularly important.
We are discussing these facts in our memo by the author of the final report, unless the provisions or other provisions close the public statement of facts or in very rare cases we find that the facts should not be presented in our memo by the author of the final report, because, as it seems, the negative effects of such a notification may be negative for the public interest rather than for the public interest.

COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.2.9.
In 2011, the Agency received an additional task related to the monitoring of the energy market.
In 2017, for the first time the REMIT elements were put into effect for the first time.
However, in April 2017, the original location in Maribor, Slovenia, was transferred to Ljubljana, the main data centre of the Agency.
As a result, backup data is now stored in the same place as the original data.

Within the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, the Agencies should establish uniform rules on electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (30) (31), in view of the fact that such a requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing comprehensive IT procedures covering all stages of the procurement procedure, launching tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Agency had none of these tools.
REPORTS FROM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICE 3.2.13.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service presented in 2017 a report on human resources management in the Agency[32]. The Agency has developed an action plan to take corrective action in areas where there is a risk that there is a need for improvement.
The annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.

In its May 2016 evaluation report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) highlighted the urgent need to clarify roles and responsibilities and to analyse the workload of the contracting entity in order to increase the efficiency of processes and processes.
In addition, IAS considered that the planning and monitoring of public procurement should be significantly improved and the Agency and IAS agreed on a corrective action plan.

As in previous years, these measures were largely linked to the implementation of the REMIT Regulation on the integration and transparency of the wholesale energy market and amounted to EUR 4.7 million in 2016 (EUR 1.1 million in 2015).
In Title II (Administration expenditure) the Agency amounted to EUR 1 million and 38% of the appropriations for the following financial year (EUR 0,8 million and 35% respectively in 2015).
The efficiency factor is directly linked to the completion or signature of procurement and public procurement procedures at the end of the year, which means the transfer of supplies and/or payments to the following year.
In 2016, 98 out of 299 Vertr.gen were signed in November and December (EUR 5 976 122,47 and 40% of the total Vertr. value in 2016).
The Agency may decide to introduce separate budgetary measures to better reflect the multifaceted nature of the contracts and the unavoidable discrepancies between contracts, supplies and payments in 2014.
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/37 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.2.8.
The Agency agrees with the results and clarifies that the Agency recognises all financial transactions in the financial system made available by the European Commission, which is updated, maintained and approved by the Commission.
With outsourcing of outsourcing services to the Commission since October 2017, the Agency will accept the approval of the invoicing system made available by the Commission in 2018.
Since migration to the ACER internal data centre in early April 2016 to the ARIS data centre and integration in one place in June 2017, in order to optimise and optimise performance and in order to meet the growing demand for space, continuity of operations can no longer be ensured in June 2017.
However, it should be noted that the current situation in which continuity cannot be ensured has been imposed on the Agency as a result of a significant reduction in the budget over the last two years.
The Agency has repeatedly warned the Commission and budgets about the serious effects of budgetary changes but has not achieved any results with regard to additional appropriations.
The Agency will continue to seek to restore the location to the disaster management by ARIS, but will not use the resources for this purpose in 2018.
Restoring the location fee for disaster management would require the Agency to receive additional funding.
Given that the risks associated with BREXIT were considered low and limited, the management carried out only an informal analysis of Brexit in 2017.
At the beginning of 2018, the Agency published a comprehensive analysis of Brexit's impact on most organisations, activities and financial activities, indicating most of the activities and activities.
In 2014, the Management Board of the Agency adopted Decision AB No 15/2014 on the Agency's language system.
Nevertheless, the Agency still needs to translate the employment notices published on the EPSO website into all the official EU languages.
Due to the very limited funding, which has been repeatedly pointed out to budget appropriations, the Agency cannot publish translation costs on the EPSO website for each individual invitation to tender in all official EU languages.
In 2017, four more of the nine invitations to tender were published on the EPSO website, including two invitations to tender and were therefore translated into all official EU languages.
In the case of tenders for posts in operational departments on the Agency's website on the Agency's website on the website on the website in which the website of the most interested candidates in this field were active and who in general followed the Agency's activities also on our website.
This approach corresponds to the pragmatic importance between contact with potential candidates and the effective use of limited resources.
3.2.12.
In 2018 the Agency will start. In 2019 it will be extended to use electronic and electronic invoices.
3.2.13.
Following the Commission's Internal Audit Report (IAS) on Human Resources Management, the Agency has agreed with IAS an action plan and is currently implementing the proposed improvements.

Therefore, it was necessary to sign the agreement with the organizer to ensure that both the instructors and organizers and the organizers of the event organize the planned training meetings.
The Agreement was signed in December 2017, and the commitment was therefore made prior to the signing of the Agreement in connection with the signing of the Financial Regulation.
Experience shows that in the first quarter of the year, in the first quarter of the year, it is very difficult to organise training without the transfer of funds from the previous year; therefore, as far as possible, in the course of further training, in the course of further training, in the course of further training.
3.3.11.
The Framework Agreement was decided in 2015.
It is considered to be in line with financial rules because other EU institutions have closed and continue to close many such locks (e.g. travel services in b.ros or banking services).
Given the particular nature of BEREC's role, a large proportion of BEREC's expenditure, consisting of BEREC's institution, concerns the waste of experts, mainly public authorities of EU Member States (e.g. national regulatory authorities, national regulatory authorities, national regulatory authorities, etc.).
It should therefore be concluded that the economic operator has no impact on this type of expenditure.
In view of the observations and the valuable exchange of views with the Court, the new opening of the procurement procedure, the procurement procedure of BEREC will also introduce other types of framework agreements which were not provided for in the legal framework in force after 2015.

The impact on the Agency's level of employment could only be assessed after the end of EU-UK relations.
Given that BEREC's financial allocations and human resources have not been modified to cover additional expenditure and additional expenditure at the time of Croatia's accession to the EU, and, taking into account the small budget of BEREC, Brexit does not provide for changes either.

COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY HOLDING AND THE CERTIFICATE 3.4.9. The Centre publishes employment notices on its own website and on social media, but usually not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, the Agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties participating in procurement procedures (46) (47). In view of the fact that this requirement also applies to EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT version covering all stages of the award of public contracts; it has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of procurement notices (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Centre was not equipped with any of these tools.

DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/45 ANSWERS OF THE CENTRE ON JUSTICE AND JUSTICE OF INTRODUCTION 3.4.8.
We note the Court's observations on the irregularities in the two recruitment procedures.
Cedefop is currently preparing a detailed assessment of these two procedures and proposes corrective action for these two and for recruitment procedures in general in order to address the shortcomings identified by the Court.
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY AND EMPLOYMENT HOLDER 3.4.9.
Cedefop uses EPSO in some cases.
Cedefop publishes its job announcements on its own website and on the website available to the agency, which is available to all EU citizens, and uses various job announcement channels, including on the ReferenceNet website, SkillsNet, the Management Board, and other opportunities such as the networks of economists, etc. Cedefop publishes job offers to the Director and Deputy Director of EPSO and uses its job offers on social media.
Cedefop considers that the additional costs of translating calls for tender into all EU official languages into the EPSO portal do not constitute the benefit that can be expected.
Cedefop took the first steps to take account of the electronic call for tenders (modules of the ăe-priority platform in 2018) within the deadline set in Directive 2014/25/EU on public procurement for all contracting entities (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement_en) (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/en).
Cedefop shall cooperate for this purpose with the Directorate-General of the DIGIT Commission, which shall be responsible for the involvement of public contractors.
In October 2018, the first call for tenders will be launched in which modules for electronic calls for tenders and electronic tenders will be used.
All general procedures shall be performed using electronic tools.
The start date of electronic invoicing will depend on whether the management of Cedefop decides to introduce accrual invoicing (using electronic invoicing as a module) or on the continued use of the internal Fibus platform (assuming that electronic invoicing will have to be created) (assuming that the platform will have to be launched).

COMMENTS ON THE ACCOUNTING COMMENTS 3.5.8.
The Court considers that it is necessary to clarify the impartiality of the accounting officer by submitting it directly to the Director (administrative matters) and to the Management Board (functional matters) of the Agency.
Framework agreements are concluded with undertakings to determine the conditions applicable during the duration of the contract for certain (single) contracts.
In the case of IT service contracts of up to EUR 22 million, the Agency has benefited from a framework agreement with three operators in the cascade system.
Under this procedure, after a competitive procedure, economic operators shall be instructed in order (cascades) to be followed for all individual applicants.
However, the terms of the Framework Agreement were not sufficiently detailed to justify fair competition and to establish a hierarchy of contractors for all potential individual applicants.
In accordance with the provisions on the application of the Financial Regulation (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) No) (Financial Regulation) No 5 (Financial Regulation) No 5 (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) No 5 Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5Financial Regulation (Financial Regulation) No) (Financial Regulation) (Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Regulation (EC) No 5Financial Regulation (EC) No 5Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No) No 5 Financial Regulation (Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) No) No) No Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) No) No) ( Financial Regulation (EC) (EC) (EC) No) No Financial Regulation (EC) (EC) No) No) No) No) (EC) (EC) (EC) (EC) No) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation (EC) No 5 Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation (EC) (EC)) ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) ( Financial Regulation) No) No) No) No) No) No) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Regulation) No) No) No 5 Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation) No) ( Financial Regulation ( Financial Regulation ( Regulation) No
3.5.10.
In accordance with the Agency's financial rules (55), contracts must be approved by the Management Board either in the Agency's annual work programme or by means of an ad hoc financing decision.
The IT Framework Agreement of EUR 15 million was concluded and signed, although the financing decision covered only EUR 5 million.
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement with the contractor. On behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including EASA) concerning the purchase of IT equipment and software and maintenance and support (IT services).
The contractor of the framework agreement will be the intermediary between the Agency and the undertakings which may provide IT services.
Although most of these IT services and related prices are defined in the framework agreement concluded under the competitive procurement procedure, the agreement also provides for the purchase of IT services which are not defined under the procurement procedure.
In the case of a paid payment of approximately EUR 300 000, the Agency purchased IT services from the contractor without a competitive procedure.
In 2017, a payment of EUR 2 million in H.H.he was made to the contractor of the framework agreement.

In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (56) (57), as this requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing all the information data covering all stages of the procurement procedure, including tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) of the procurement notices (2015) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
In accordance with the information communicated by the Commission by the end of 2017, the Agency has put in place procedures for the electronic invitation to tender and the submission of tenders, with the exception of electronic invoicing.
REPORTS FROM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICE 3.5.14
In 2017, the Internal Audit Service submitted to the Commission an evaluation report evaluating the preparation by EASA of the European Aviation Safety Plan (58).
The Agency has developed an action plan to take corrective action in areas where the situation is likely to improve.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/49 PL ANNEX Follow-up action in relation to the Court's observations in previous years Although in 2016 in relation to the deficit of EUR 7.6 million financed by industry, the budgetary results vary from year to year[1), and the Agency has accumulated EUR 52 million per year from this kind of rigor.
The Agency's implementing regulation provides that the costs incurred by industry should be proportionate to the costs incurred by the Agency in this respect and should therefore be proportionate to the costs incurred by the Agency.
Between 2014 and 2016, the Agency used its transfer to a new building worth EUR 9.4 million (2016: EUR 4.4 million) to finance renovation (and removal) costs of EUR 12.4 million.
The Commission has contributed EUR 3 million from the EU budget for this purpose.
Year 2016: correction (completed/completed/completed/completed/n.d.)
DE C 434/50 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.5.8.
The Agency discussed this issue within the Agency's network forum in order to clarify the issue and develop a common position.
The Agency shall implement the agreed common approach and shall in any case clearly separate the accounting role from the operational functions and shall include the Management Board in the renewal and evaluation cycle.
3.5.9.
In order to prepare this procedure, the Agency carried out a market analysis and concluded that the main IT service providers supported all necessary services under this procedure.
The Agency has therefore come to the conclusion that the multiple framework agreement, with a renewed call for competition, has led to significant administrative burdens, which, compared to what is involved, have been found to be undeniable.
As in the case of high value tenders and as a result of the Court's observations, the Agency will be able to resume the selection process increasingly in order to promote competition.
The purpose of this Framework Agreement is to support evidence of the concept and the initial phase of the new project (Data4Safety), the financing and structure of which have developed over the months together with a number of parties.
The value of the order was EUR 15 million, but ultimately EUR 4 million.
In this way, payments cannot be made outside this amount.

In the case of four of the FWWWW of the Qualit Weight of 60 out of 40 and the other 50 out of 50. We believe that the low proportion of the financial evaluation carried out by the Court is linked to factors that EBA has no influence on, including the low interest in the tender (due to the exchange rate risk, the size of the contract, the high costs in connection with the tender and the low profit margins), and the low value of the technical offers.
EBA publishes multiple media notices: on the EBA website, on Twitter and LinkedIn, on EU training, in EurActiv, on the ESCB-HRC network, in the Financial Times and elsewhere (in places with a higher profile).
In February 2018, EBA published ten calls for proposals on the EPSO website in all official EU languages.
EBA considers that through the use of these headings it ensures full transparency in the publication of employment notices and achieves objectives among EU citizens.

Without questioning the Commission's opinion in point 3.7.4, the Court wishes to stress that the Agency is partly financed by it and that it is financed by any undertaking applying for the registration of chemicals in accordance with the REACH Regulation72.
The techniques used depend on the size of enterprises (small enterprises, small, medium and large enterprises) and on the quantity of chemicals registered (different quantitative thresholds).
3.7.6.
According to the Enforcement Regulation[73], the calculation and invoicing of information by the Agency is based on information provided by the companies at the time of the application.
Since the first registration in 2009, around 30% of the companies have claimed to be micro, small or medium-sized enterprises.
The Agency has made considerable efforts to introduce an ex-post ex-post control system to obtain information from these applicants on the scope of the company's activities.
In this way, the Agency could conclude that, on the basis of the already completed review investigations, around 55% of the above-mentioned companies, which, according to it, were micro, small or medium-sized enterprises (16% of all companies), were wrong to indicate their size, which means that they were lower.
In order to remedy this situation, the Agency has, over the years, charged EUR 16.4 million to cover ex post expenditure to correct expenditure of EUR 16.4 million of EUR 16.4 million.
However, the reviews are significant on the R-scale compared to the remaining amount of the necessary corrections was not known at the end of 2017-74.
This statement indicates that the system is based to too much on the self-assessment of applicants.
REACH provides that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had
The Agency is therefore not involved in the examination of the latter element f is not included in its calculation.
Payments Judgment on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts 3.7.8.
According to our assessment, the payments underlying the annual accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 are correct and correct in all material respects.
3.7.9
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.7.10
In the case of more companies registered and registered as micro, small or medium-sized enterprises, which misunderstood data relating to business data (see paragraph to highlight the facts in point 3.75), where the Agency's ex post controls were carried out, ex post controls have shown that in the case of more companies registered and registered by companies, micro, small or medium-sized enterprises that have wrongly shown irregularities (see paragraph to highlight the facts in point 3.75).
This can be partly explained by the complex Commission rules on the determination of the size of the company (75) and partly by a financial incentive for the determination of the size of the company, as the registration authorities are much higher.
Since the original registration authorities are collected on the basis of the size of the company indicated, false information may have a significant negative impact on the revenue of the Agency if it is not disclosed.
Although the Agency reviews the given provisions for smaller enterprises in the ex post control, in the ex post control, compared to 2012 in the ex post control, as part of the ex-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po

On 6 December 2017, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2017/1494 [2] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 6 December 2017 to 6 December 2017 [2] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 6 December 2017 to 6 December 2017 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 6 December 2017 to 6 December 2017.
The Agency's capacity to carry out its tasks depends on the effectiveness of the practical implementation of the framework by the national authorities.
In its overall report of 2017, the Agency concludes that around two thirds of companies do not update the recorded information on the quantities of chemicals they deal with.
This affects the effective implementation of the REACH Regulation and the accuracy of the calculations.
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY HOLDER AND THE CERTIFICATE 3.7.13. The Agency shall publish notices of employment on its own website and on social media but usually not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
OTHER COMMENTS 3.7.14.
The Agency's revenue from employment contracts is linked to the time limits for the registration of chemicals in the EU set out in the REACH Regulation (2010, 2013 and 2018).
The Agency therefore does not collect regular information and cannot offset relatively stable expenditure and stable, less predictable revenues, which makes budget planning difficult.
The Agency shall be assisted by a grant which shall be supported by the Commission in relation to this situation.
As the third and last period of registration of chemical substances under REACH expires in 2018, revenue from taxes and charges is expected to disappear from 2019 and the Agency will continue to finance its activities from the EU budget.
The annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/59 year 2014 2016 2016 2016 2016 Status of corrective work (completed/in/out/out/out/out/out/out/out) In the course of work In the course of work In the course of work In the course of the Court's observations of previous years, the expenditure on procedures related to the Agency's new special knowledge, the implementation of the Biocidal Products Regulation, has, in principle, been covered by procedures to assess whether these products have been registered.
However, the expenditure collected in 2014 covered only 17% of these expenditures, and this part was actually financed by the Agency's contribution to the Union (EUR 6,3 million) and the EFTA States (EUR 0,2 million). Accordingly, the part was actually financed by the Agency's contribution to the Union (EUR 10.1 million and 39% in 2015) respectively, in Title III, Title IV (operational expenditure under REACH), in Title IV (operational expenditure under biocidal products) compared to III and 68 per cent (in 2015: EUR 1,5 million and 74 per cent), in Title IV (operational expenditure under REACH), in Title IV (operational expenditure).
Such a high revenue ratio is contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness; the Agency may attempt to harmonise budgetary resources in order to better deal with the multi-annual nature of the opportunities, as well as the inevitable divergences between contracts, supplies and payments.
In Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In its evaluation report of November 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the structure and practical implementation of the ECHA internal control system for the Agency's processes and tasks under the Biocidal Products Regulation is effective and effective.
Although no major changes have been identified, the IAS still recognises the need to improve the situation.
Unlike most other agencies, the ECHA Regulation does not impose the obligation to carry out periodic external evaluations, which are essential to the evaluation of results.
(1) In 2017, the Agency adopted EUR 8.1 million for biocidal products and charges (2016: EUR 7.6 million), which included 65% of expenditure on biocidal products (2015: 62 % and 2016: 88%).
This part was financed from the Union contribution (EUR 6.3 million) and the EFTA States (EUR 0.2 million) to the Agency's budget.

In the future, we will be working more closely with the SME Agency on the basis of the principle of cost and benefit.
3.7.11
Regulation REACH (EC) No 340/2008 does not provide the Agency with the tools necessary to enforce the application of administrative charges.
The Agency actively reminds debtors of their obligation to pay, and if they fail to succeed, it gives a local lawyer the right to claim outstanding amounts and fees directly in the Member States.
The firm has so far contacted 74% of companies that are obliged to pay administrative fees and the outcome of this initiative will be analysed the costs and benefits to determine the state of the art.
Member States are primarily responsible for the enforcement of the REACH Regulation and the CLP Regulation, in particular for the registration of chemicals.
The Agency's ability to carry out its tasks and to derive adequate revenue from the Agency's revenue depends on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the implementation of the enforcement strategy by the national authorities.
In order to address this problem, the Commission shall communicate with the Commission.
3.7.13.
The Agency takes note of the preliminary remarks which concern a number of agencies, namely a horizontal issue.
The Agency shall publish notices of employment on its own website, on social media and on the website of the EU Agency Network (EUAN) (https://euagenties.eu/).
In order to increase transparency and transparency and to enable citizens to read employment notices, the Agency recommends that the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) in turn refer to the EUAN website.
3.7.14.
The initial remark is correct.
The Agency shall be financed through a combination of revenue from fees and charges and a compensatory subsidy from the European Union.
The Agency has submitted several alternative financing proposals to the Commission, including financing at regular intervals, as has been the case with some other EU agencies.
The Agency notes that, in accordance with the Commission Communication on the review of REACH Regulation of 5 March 2018 (COM (2018) 116 final) on the review of all possible options for ensuring sustainable funding for the Agency in the future.

2016)...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The amendment of the individual grant agreement with Climate KIC was signed even in January 2017, after the end of the transitional period.
Thanks to the agreed increase in the refund, the KICs could receive EUR 15 million in the EIT financial contribution (EUR 6.0 million, including Climate KICs, EUR 5.6 million in EIT Health, EUR 2.2 million in the InnoEnergy KICs and EUR 1.2 million in the EIT RawMaterials).
This approach is contrary to the intention of the KICs to create the best possible sources of funding and to encourage the gradual reduction of their financial capacity with the EIT.
It may also harm fair competition between KICs as co-financing expenditure is also important for annual grants.
3.9.8.
In addition, as a result of changes in the activities of KIC InnoEnergy and EIT Digital as a result of changes in economic activity, some of those which were not foreseen as a result of the initial economic activity were added a total of some EUR 3.3 million and EUR 0.6 million.
The Court considers that the quality added to the KIC InnoEnergy represents a significant change to the original plan, based on which a maximum maximum grant amount has been set.
Since the level of grants granted to individual KICs is the result of an evaluation of the results to which its original proposals are subject, significant changes to these programmes would affect applications for financial assistance and equal treatment of KICs, which is contrary to Article 180 (4) of the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation.
3.9.9.
COMMENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.9.10
In 2017, the Institute launched a paperless payment system.
Although this has led to changes in its invoicing procedures and system, the invoicing system has not been re-approved since 2012.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.9.11.
In order to further strengthen the internal control system for financial assistance to the KICs, the EIT has carried out centralised ex ante controls for those KICs partners whose financial statements have increased by EUR 325 000.
These audits were carried out on behalf of the EIT (86) by two audit firms and by the certified financial statements of the KICs partners.
The results of the ex post audits carried out by another audit company employed by the EIT confirm that the new approach to certified financial statements is effective and important since most of the material errors that were detected concerned financial statements that were not subject to ex ante control.
(86) In previous years, the audit of the certificates was carried out by numerous private audit firms acting on behalf of individual KICs partners, whose cost statements submitted were higher than the threshold of EUR 325 000 (refund of actual costs and unit costs).
DE C 434/66 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.9.12.
The Business Continuity Plan and the Business Continuity Plan of the EIT were adopted in 2013 and are obsolete.
For example, in 2017 the EIT ceased to work in the EIT more than in the case of the members of the crisis management team.
For two years, work has been underway on updating the version of Plzen, but it has not yet been adopted.
As in previous years, KICs have not fully implemented the EIT grants.
The total eligible cost of KIC added value assets for KICs that were functional before 2016 (including KICs of the first and second wave) was 15% lower than that for KICs of the beginning of 2016 (87).
The under-use of funds was partly due to the approval of subsequent grant agreements and to the multi-annual nature of the KICs' activities... incomplete implementation... and an indicator of the self-financing of the administrative costs of certain KICs.
Part of this appropriation has been used to increase the cost of f per f narderf in the context of the activation of the KIC's added value for the pre-planned individual refund (see point 3.9.7).
In particular, EIT Health and RawMaterials had to wait for their start-up.
For the first wave KICs, in particular the EIT evaluation reports, the results of the KICs on Climate KICs were insufficient.
3.9.14.
The EIT has carried out an performance assessment and has calculated several amendments.
However, none of the KICs had a financial impact on these corrections.
According to Horizon 2020, the calculation of the financial contribution of the EIT shall only apply the same corrections as are necessary for financial control and for the evaluation of results.

It is doubtful whether the adjustments to be made, for example for educational activists, should be included in the adjustments to be made on the basis of financial control, for example for innovative projects.
3.9.15.
In 2017, all KICs adopted collaborative financing strategies, in line with the EIT guidelines, which represents an important step towards the future stability of the KICs.
Nevertheless, first wave KICs continued to generate low revenues (from 2% to 6% of KIC's value added costs) and low progress was made in 2017.
Co-financing from KIC partners is also still low (and is lower than provided for in individual grant agreements signed in the first place): the value added KIC assets are still financed up to 62% to 90% of the EIT grant depending on the KIC.
3.9.16.
The EIT publishes employment notices on its own website and on the website of the Directorate-General for Human Resources and Security, but usually not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
3.9.17.
Within the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in public procurement procedures (88), as this requirement also applies to EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing comprehensive IT documentation covering all stages of the public procurement procedure.
The Commission has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic invitation to tender in the electronic version of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic invoicing (2015).
OTHER COMMENTS 3.9.18.
The current interim director of the EIT began his position in July 2014.
In 2016, the procedure for the selection of a new director was started, but it did not work.
No new recruitment procedure has been initiated since then.
This is a position contrary to the Staff Regulations, according to which the post may be filled before the expiry of one year.
3.9.19.
In accordance with Article 5.1 of the EIT Statute, the staff of the EIT shall be directly recruited by the EIT in the context of temporary staff exchanges.
The EIT may therefore offer its temporary staff only temporary staff for a period of five years which may be missed for a period of five years.
The staff who joined the EIT shortly after the establishment of the EIT in 2009 will lead to a maximum duration of the 2020 agreement in 2020, which in the coming years could help to support action and administration.
(87) I is still 6% lower than the individual grant agreements, which were amended in December 2016 and January 2017.

Completed (2) Last (3) Completed (3) Completed Completed Completed Completed Completed... Completed......... Disclaimer Court's observations of the previous years No specific thresholds for specific categories of costs (staff costs, sub-contracting, legal services, etc.) are specified in the grant agreements.
In 2014, the Institute estimated the budgetary needs of EUR 13,1 million, i.e. EUR 5,6 million (EUR 3,4 million and 2,5% respectively in 2013), and EUR 233,1 million, which could be used, amounted to only EUR 220 million.
Low exploitation rates are essentially an amount of unused funding for grants (€11.4 million) to finance the KIC's capacity.
As regards the activities of the KICs on the basis of which grant agreements were concluded, it was not necessary to make full use of the funds for which the Institut was intended for 2014.
The unused appropriations will be entered in the budget for 2015-2017 in accordance with the Institute's Financial Regulation.
Although KICs need to develop funding strategies for funding, they continue to be fully based on funding from the KICs' Institute and partners, to date, in the year in which they entered into force.
Since the Institute was established in 2009, the Institute has been able to cope with high fluctuations in the number of employees and instability.
Two of the three management posts have not been filled since 2013.
One of them has been exempted since 2013, which is contrary to the Staff Regulations, which provides for a period of one year.
The second one now has a COO, which is also a temporary director and therefore has three functions at the same time.
In its Special Report No 4/2016, the Court concluded that the condition that the EIT's contribution to the KICs should not exceed 25% does not confer a significant advantage and that its abolition significantly reduces the burden on the KICs' partners with operational and financial reporting (4).
However, these certificates are very qualitatively differentiated, which limits the safety that can be obtained from them, and requires the Institute to carry out additional checks.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/69 EN Court's observations Gem C...§ of the Regulation on the Regulation on the EIT as regards the Institute's tasks as regards the mobility of public and private resources and [] the use of resources in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.
In particular, the Institute aims to obtain a significant and growing part of its budget from private financial advisors and from revenues generated by its own experience.
Despite this provision, which explicitly refers to the EIT budget, the Horizon 2020 contribution amounted to 99% of the 2015 budget.
Although the institution cannot allocate unused appropriations (i.e. unused or released at the end of the year) to the budget expenditure for the next three years, it has not adjusted its procedures in due time, so that, under the grant agreements concluded in 2014, the amount of EUR 26,6 million for the budget expenditure for 2015-2017 can be estimated.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on research and development as the KICs have used less funding than expected.
In line with the initial objective of the Commission, the Institute should have financial autonomy in 2010.
However, in June 2011, the Institute obtained only part of the financial autonomy, since applications for grants and procurement procedures worth EUR 60 000 are still subject to the prior approval of the Directorate-General for Education and Culture.
The Institute supports the EIT Digital Master School programme, in which 16 European Universities participate.
The model f wp of the university's costs is based on a combination of a lump sum of EUR 8 000/beneficiaries (in line with the Erasmus Mundus rules) of actual costs, including indirect costs calculated on a lump sum basis.
On this basis, universities received an average of EUR 15 000/students in 2015 (including a lump sum).
However, this model was not set in a comfortable way at any time and it cannot be distinguished which benefits are lower than a lump sum and which are lower than the actual costs.
The institution should change the expenditure into a clear and simplest model based on a single method, such as a single flat rate based on evidence of costs.
Year 2015 Correction status (completed/completed/completed/incomplete/n.d.)
C 434/70 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's observations Contrary to the principle of cost-effectiveness of the budget, another partner of the KICs, through the procurement procedure, commissioned the provision of public services of between EUR 800 and EUR 3 250 per person, which was reimbursed by the Institute in full (7).
Between 2015 and 2016, the Institute adopted a Commission Framework Agreement on the organisation of a conference on innovation.
The prices established for these services ranged from EUR 800 per day for younger consultants to EUR 2 250 per day for senior consultants (so they were almost four times higher than the prices established in the framework agreement).
The services obtained at these prices amount to more than EUR 100 000 per conference.
The Court found shortcomings in ex post controls in the procurement procedures of the KICs' legal entities.
At least for one of the KICs' legal entities, the selection of the procurement procedures to be carried out was not the subject for the population.
The Court also came to another conclusion in two procurement procedures with regard to their legality and regularity.
In these Fats, the Institute accepted a direct suggestion, the extension of the rebellion.
In the Commission's internal audit report ăGrant Management ăGrant: Transition to Horizon 2020 to Horizon 2020 to Transition to Horizon 2020 (management of financial assistance: transition to Horizon 2020), the Institute has successfully adapted its procedures to Horizon 2020, in particular to Horizon 2020, and the audit carried out by the Institute in the start-up phase has generally proved to be an effective tool to support new KICs.
The IAS also stated that urgent action was needed to ensure the necessary application of the legal framework under Horizon 2020 and to further improve the start-up phase of the new KICs. The Institute and the IAS agreed on a corrective action plan under Horizon 2020.
Title II states that EUR 0,4 million and 40% (EUR 0,4 million and 44% respectively in 2015) showed a high commitment rate in the following financial year.
These results relate mainly to the year of the implementation of IT services and the costs of meetings for which invoices have not yet been received.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/71 PL The Court's observations of the Grants for the calendar year 2015 were granted only in April 2015 and the grant agreements were signed in June and July 2015.
For the calendar year 2016, grants were granted and signed in April 2016.
Despite the improvement in 2016, these doubts related to the collection of grants and the signing of grant agreements in order to ensure security and reduce the willingness of the partners to make amends and redress at the beginning of the year.
The oldest calls for new KICs, the themes of which are set out in the EIT's Strategic Innovation Plan 2014-2020, have little impact on competition.
In response to the 2014 call for two KICs (health and RawMaterials) only seven proposals were presented.
In response to the call published in 2016, two additional KICs (Food and Manufacturing) received three proposals and the only KIC Manufacturing proposal (added value in production) was not distinguished from quality and quality.
The Director has been busy since August 2014 and since February 2013 he has been an alternate ad interim.
This is not only not contrary to the statute, according to which the previous occupation may not last more than a year, not only because of the constant change and long-term downtime, but also because of the stakeholders, but also because of the impact on the strategic continuance. The Institute is an important participant in the implementation of Horizon 2020, with a budget of EUR 2.4 billion for 2014-2020.
The Commission has set up a central support body for Horizon 2020 to ensure coherence between programme implementation actors in areas such as legal services, IT tools, grant management, dissemination and use of research results, etc.
However, unlike Commission executive agencies and public-private partnerships, the Institute does not have direct access to the support agency, but must, in any case, obtain the approval of the Commission's Directorate-General.
This requirement has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the Institute's activities.
Year 2016 Year-to-year (completed/completed/completed/completed/n.d.)
C 434/72 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's comments Coordination and representation of KICs are carried out by the KICs' legal entities, which are almost fully financed by the Institute.
The Court drew particular attention to the procurement procedures to be carried out by those authorities, considering them to be a high risk area.
In the case of grant agreements concluded in 2015, the KIC legal entities and/or KIC partners must ensure that in the case of grant agreements the best results are achieved in 2015 or, where appropriate, based on the lowest price criterion.
For all applications for grants worth more than EUR 60 000, in accordance with grant agreements, KIC legal entities and/or KIC partners must invite at least three economic operators to submit tenders and document the procurement procedure in order to demonstrate their transparency.
The Court has carried out a sample of contracts worth approximately EUR 7 million which have been financed entirely by the EIT by the KIC's legal entities.
In this regard, the Commission considers that, given that the Commission considers that, in view of the fact that, at this stage, the Commission considers that, at that stage, the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission can not consider that the Commission can not consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission cannot consider that the Commission can consider, pursuant to Article 108 (2) of the TFEU, Article 108 (2) of the TFEU, Article 108 (3) of the TFEU, Article 3 (3) of the TFEU, Article 3 (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) of the Treaty, Article 3 (3) of the Treaty and (3) of the Treaty, cannot consider that the Commission can consider that the Commission can, pursuant to the Commission cannot, pursuant to Article 108 (2) of the TFEU, Article 108 (2) of the TFEU, Article 108 (2) of the TFEU,
The Institute also concluded that in procurement procedures for a KIC legal entity, in order to improve procurement procedures for all KIC legal entities, the Institute has developed an action plan.
Despite a significant increase in the budget from EUR 309 million (2008-2013) to EUR 2,4 billion (2014-2020) and despite the existence of six KICs since the end of 2016, and not three KICs, the number of posts approved to the Institute has not changed much (see Table 2).
As stated in the Court's Special Report No 4/2016 [9], there is a danger that the Institute will not be able to make full use of the work it will not be able to make full use of.
The Institute's interim director drew attention to this risk in the Institute's annual activity report for 2015.
In particular, from 2016 the grant agreements shall specify the administrative costs in the grant agreements.
The budgetary needs for 2016 were too high by EUR 13.1 million and EUR 5.0% (EUR 25 million and 9,4% respectively in 2015), and therefore only EUR 249.9 million were allocated to EUR 263 million for transferable.
Unused appropriations may be entered in the budget for 2017-2019.
The EIT funded on average 90% of the charity costs reported by the KICs under grant agreements in 2015.
The data collected by the KICs from different sources represented 2,5% of the proposed budget by the EIT.
Special Report No 4/2016: The European Institute of Innovation and Technology must amend its implementation mechanisms and certain conceptual elements to achieve the expected effect.
The EIT continues to implement the EIT Regulation in a different way, as indicated in its response to the 2015 report.
In 2016, universities received an average of EUR 17 000 per year and students on the basis of the model described on the basis of the combination of actual costs and flat-rate costs. This model was established at the end of 2016 and will be applied from 2017.
In 2016 (the 2015 proposal for financial assistance) the EIT paid EUR 410 000 for this task.
In February 2018, the position was taken.
In June 2018, the Commission initiated the recruitment procedure for the position of Director.
Special Report No 4/2016: The European Institute of Innovation and Technology must amend its implementation mechanisms and certain conceptual elements in order to achieve the expected effects.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/73 ANSWERS OF THE INSTITUTIONS 3.9.7.
The EIT wishes to clarify that for individual financial assistance agreements, the EIT's framework partnership agreement may be submitted at any time during the transitional period.
The KICs have been subject to a technical and financial assessment of the EIT and to the prior approval of the European Commission.
Amendments were signed in December 2016.
In the case of EIT Climate-KIC the KICs was formally notified of the approval of the request for amendment on 21 December 2016 (i.e. during the spring period).
As regards the amount of individual refunds, the EIT notes that the additional amount of the grant was not paid to the KICs in 2016 as a result of changes to individual grant agreements.
The total amount of aid finally granted (EUR 241.8 million) was significantly lower than the amount initially planned (EUR 274.9 million).
As regards the call for KICs to create their own sources of funding and funding, we refer to our response to point 3.9.15.
In the evaluation of the EIT amending measure, after consulting the European Commission, it concluded that the adjustment of individual refunds is in line with the legal basis in force and does not affect the equal treatment of the KICs.
All KICs were open on equal terms to adjust individual refunds.
As regards the second observation, the EIT considers that the amendments to Article 180 (4) of the Financial Regulation were in line with the Financial Regulation as they did not undermine Article 180 (4) of the Financial Regulation on grants and did not undermine the equal treatment of applicants.
It should be noted that there is no provision on the materiality threshold which indicates what amendment of the measure can be considered material by assessing whether the amendment is relevant for assessing whether the change is relevant for the implementation of the aid.
Based on the adequacy and impact of the activities carried out, it should be established whether the introduction of new activities complies with this provision on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of the adequacy and impact of the activities carried out under the KIC Action Plan as a whole.
The EIT assessed before approving the amendment measure and concluded that the changes did not undermine the possibility of granting the grant.
Since each KIC had the opportunity to include new opportunities in its changed opportunities on equal terms, on equal terms, it also referred to equal treatment of KICs.
In addition, the EIT notes that for EIT InnoEnergy the only comment that could be contested was only 3.9% of the revised budget estimate of the KICs' development plan.
For EIT, this figure was 0.6%.
3.9.10.
3.9.12.
In 2018, the EIT shall adopt updated versions of the contingency plan and the contingency plan for the re-launch after the collapse of the system.
3.9.13.
The individual grant agreements concluded with EIT Health and EIT RawMaterials in 2016 were signed with delay rather than foreseen as the framework partnership agreements had to be signed in the first place.
Individual aid agreements for 2017 and 2018 were systematically signed in February, which enabled the KICs to start operations in a given year.
Due to the dynamic and dynamic nature of innovative activities, it is not possible to plan linearly.
Some of their innovative projects or projects do not meet their expectations of their potential and cannot be completed during the implementation of grant agreements... Some of their operational activities, such as master's and doctoral studies, or long-term research and innovation projects, are carried out from home for several years.
The EIT intends to conclude a grant agreement with the KICs for more than one year after 2020, provided that the EIT budget allocates the corresponding commitment appropriations in instalments for more than one year.
In fact, the EIT has complied with the methodology for the calculation of grants set out in the legal basis of the Horizon 2020 in an unlimited manner and will continue to comply with the existing legislation.
The financial stability of the KICs is a unique ambition of the EIT-KIC model and one of the most difficult aspects of the EIT mission.
At present, some innovative communities can already show significant co-financing, which can be linked to their capabilities, and generate significant revenue compared to their budget.
In this way, the EIT supported 26% (22 million euro) co-financing to cover the cost of KIC value added actions in 2016.
Another example is EIT Health: KIC obtained in the first year of operation EUR 6 million in revenue compared to total funding received from the EIT (about EUR 19 million).

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/77 PL ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations in previous years In 2014, the Agency concluded a framework agreement of EUR 3.5 million for the purchase of goods and services in the IT sector for a period of six years.
The Agency challenged the demand and the forecast value of the contract, which resulted in 80% of the contract being closed by the end of 2016.
A new procurement procedure should be launched four years later than expected, resulting in additional administrative costs.
In 2016, the Agency completed the purchase of pollution control systems within the seven framework.
Each framework agreement (each batch in the procurement procedure) referred to a specific contract.
The tendering procedure was initiated on the assumption that the total value of the seven framework agreements would be EUR 7 million.
However, under this assumption, the Agency's needs were undermined and seven legal frameworks were signed for EUR 7 million, resulting in a total amount of EUR 49 million for the Vertragge.
Year 2016: year 2016: year 2016: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year: year
DE C 434/78 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.10.8.
The Agency will remind authorised project officials to verify consistently whether the prices charged by the supplier are correctly charged and/or whether they are applied.
EMSA will also ask the contracting authority operating under this Framework Agreement to ask the contractor to present in response to the requirements for the submission of tenders in a way that always takes into account the market price/payment.
3.10.9.
Following a judicial ruling, EPSO decided that only notices of employment in the official languages of the EU or in the languages indicated in the Agency's implementing act could be published on EPSO's website.
In view of the high cost of translating this new policy (about EUR 19000 per quoted entity), EMSA no longer uses EPSO services on this basis, like many other agencies.
In December 2015, some agencies raised this issue against EPSO.
EMSA wishes to ensure adequate transparency and compliance with the principle of sound financial management.
The Agency is trying to disseminate its employment notices to the general public by disseminating them to the various social media used by many people.
It should be noted that most EMSA employment offers are addressed to technical specialists who regularly use EMSA's website.
In 2017, EMSA carried out extensive preparations to adapt all internal procedures to the use of e-procurement.
EMSA can best cope with the fact that since the beginning of 2018 it has employed e-procurement modules.
The deadline for EU entities to use electronic public procurement is October 2018.

External evaluation report 3.11.11.
In 2017, an external evaluation of the Agency's performance in 2013-2016 (106) was carried out on behalf of the Commission.
The annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.
(106) The farm did not do the job.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/81 (1) According to ENISA, the number of employees was reduced to 11 employees at the end of 2017. In 2016, the number of employees (completed/completed/uncompleted/n.d.) In 2016, n. n. n. ENISA Following the Court's observations from previous years, the Agency plans to partially transfer administrative staff from Heraklion to Athens in 2016.
In Title II (administrative expenditure) the appropriations entered for the following financial year amount to EUR 0,3 million and 25% (2015: EUR 0,15 million and 22% respectively).
This high rate is essentially linked to expenditure under Title I (staff expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) and is mainly linked to IT investments and the purchase of a business car shortly before the end of the year.
In accordance with the Agency's financial rules, external evaluations of the Agency's performance were carried out in 2014 and 2015 and the final reports were presented in October 2015 and May 2016 respectively.
The 2014 assessment concluded that the main operational elements of the 2014 Work Programme were clearly linked to the Agency's legal mandate and that the Agency's effectiveness was considered to be good.
However, the need to improve the division of the agencies between Heraklion and Athens has been identified, leading to difficult work and lack of communication and cooperation.
The 2015 assessment concluded that the Agency's tasks and results correspond to the needs for network and information security across the EU and in the Member States and that the Agency effectively meets the expectations of its stakeholders.
However, the report stresses that communication between the Agency and its stakeholders The report stresses that the Agency's mandate and scope are too limited.
The Agency shall implement an action plan which it has therefore agreed with the Governing Board.
In 2016, the Agency transferred eight additional staff to Athens, which reduced the number of staff in Heraklion to 14 (1).
As the Court pointed out in the 2013 report, the collection of all staff in one place would probably reduce costs even further.
DE C 434/82 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.11.8.
Although the exchange of information on new accounts has never been formalised, it has not formalised itself for informal sessions aimed at the transfer of knowledge on new accounts.
The new accountant has also received updated SAP training to ensure a good understanding of the invoicing system.
However, ENISA will take corrective action to ensure adequate communication of information between the splitting workers and the new workers.
3.11.9.
Calls for tender, published by EPSO, must be translated into all EU official languages.
Due to the limited budget resources, ENISA is unfortunately unable to bear these costs.
However, the Agency uses traditional and social media and committed itself to working together in the creation of a decentralised portal to reduce the risk of job advertisements being published, as many decentralised institutions face the same problem.
ENISA has not carried out a formal operational and financial review of Brexit as it has no significant direct impact on the budget, operation and management of ENISA.
However, internal procedures (e.g. purchases and settings) were included in the Brexit context.

ESMA recognises this problem and will continue to follow progress in the Brexit negotiations.
EPSO has decided to publish notices of ESMA's posts on its website only if the notices of posts are available in 24 languages.
In 2017, the translation costs incurred by ESMA (f.n.f. employment notices of 16) amounted to EUR 32 431.
ESMA considers that the cost of translating all calls for tender in 23 languages is not justified in order to obtain the economic budget and has therefore decided to use other media in which most EU agencies publish their employment notices.

COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.149
The appropriations made available for Title II (administrative expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) amounted to 40% for each title or to a total of EUR 3.5 million, contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness.
There is no evidence that appropriations are carried over related to expenditure planned during the budgetary procedure.
For example, in December 2017, the Agency ordered EUR 220 000 in the amount of EUR 220 000.
Agencies should establish uniform rules on electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in public procurement procedures (123) (124) because these rules also apply to EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT whole covering all stages of the public procurement procedure. The Commission has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of public procurement notices (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Agency had none of these tools.
3.14.11.
Unlike most other agencies, the Agency has not carried out a comprehensive analysis of Brexit's potential impact on Brexit's organisation, organisation, organisation and accounts.

C 438/92 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 2016 2016 Implementation of the DE ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations of previous years Title II (administrative expenditure) (2015): EUR 364 740 and 26% of appropriations from the financial year 2017) (administrative expenditures) (EUR 417 279 and 30% respectively).
These measures concern mainly IT services which have not yet been fully implemented or calculated at the end of the year.
The appropriations granted under Title III for the following financial year amounted to EUR 3370616 and 43% (2015: EUR 3383052 and 41%).
These measures mainly concern research projects and research projects lasting over one year.
In 2014, the Agency concluded a framework agreement on IT services for the period 2014-2017 for a total amount of EUR 1,1 million.
Although individual implementation forms of the Framework Agreement signed in 2016 clearly defined project services, time and resources were imposed on consultants, and the price is not fixed and directly linked to the results, but results from the number of working days worked.
In addition, in 2016, around 50% of IT consulting services were provided outside the scope of the Agency's activities, allowing the Agency to monitor to a limited extent the effective implementation of the programme.
In 2016, payments made after the adoption of this Framework Agreement amounted to around EUR 0,4 million.
The Agency's implementing regulation shall not impose any requirements for external assessments of their competence.

As part of the 2017 work programme for 2017 for 2017 for 2017 and 2017 for 2017 and 2017 for 2017 and 2017 for 2017 and 2017 and for 2017.
Title II benefits mainly relate to services where Vertrag has two calendar years.
As regards the amount of EUR 0,2 million, it should be noted that, as of 2014, the amount of appropriations under Title II has been reduced to EUR 1,4 million, EUR 0,6 million per year and EUR 1,4 million per year.
In 2017, the amending budget in Title II was further reduced by EUR 60 000 in the form of an amending budget adopted in June, meaning that the contribution of local authorities to the EU-OSHA infrastructure budget was added to the EU-OSHA budget.
Most of the IT service contracts in question were planned for 2018 (documented in the draft budget for 2017 and in the subsequent budgetary phases), but in 2017 when the appropriations were intended to cover expenditure, appropriations for this purpose (10 000 euro).
From the 2019 budget, the programming document will contain a list of possible procurements for IT services, provided, for example, that the most powerful price renegotiations are available for expenditure.
The Management Board, Parliament and the Council have been informed that the titles (in accordance with the provisions of the framework Financial Regulation) have been abolished.
3.14.10.
Since the end of 2016, the Agency shall provide electronic access to all the procedures started (ex ante notifications of low or medium value entries and contract notices) and shall also provide specific e-mail addresses for all procedures started (ex ante notifications of low or medium value entries and contract notices).
2018 (target: October) The Agency will launch the process of announcing and examining requests for information until tenders are submitted for the launch of the electronic call for tenders tool.
The Agency has now carried out an analysis of the potential impact of Brexit on its organisation, as well as an analysis of operating costs and costs.

COMMENTS ON THE ADAPTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.15.8.
As part of this type of work of the EU agencies, the Court has analysed the accounts, including the hierarchical position and discord of their agencies.
At the Foundation, the head of the Administration and Finance Department is the head of the accounting department.
Within the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (129) (130). Since these rules also apply to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing an IT whole covering all stages of the procurement procedure, launching tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the information submitted by the Commission by the end of 2017, the Foundation has put in place certain procedures for invoicing electronic and electronic invitations to tender but has not put in place an electronic invitation to tender.
The Annex provides an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.

(130) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95 (2) of the eGovernment (ăe-Government.)
C 434/96 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 PL ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations in previous years In the Court's report on the 2014 annual accounts, the Court pointed out that, in the period 2005-2014, workers were too redundant in relation to the changes in the EU Staff Regulations in 2005.
Although too low consumption varies (2014: non-compliance with the minimum guarantees; 2015: the application of the wrong multiplication factors to bottlenecks), the Court again found too low consumption (€43350) and some non-compliance with the guarantee (€168930) for 30 active-service workers and workers.
Eurofound has corrected all too low amounts of waste but will not demand waste (in accordance with Article 85 of the current Staff Regulations).
The Foundation should re-examine the errors that may have arisen as a result of the 2005 transition to the Staff Regulations and carry out a comprehensive assessment of the remuneration.
In its evaluation report of December 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed that the Foundation must improve project management, in particular in terms of management, monitoring and reporting.
The Foundation and IAS have agreed on a corrective action plan.
Together with EUR 2.8 million and 43% (EUR 2.1 million and 31% respectively in 2015), the 2016 allocation rate increased in line with Title III (operational expenditure), which was essentially related to annual projects (research and pilot trials).
The Foundation may decide to introduce separate budgetary measures to better reflect the multi-annual nature of the responsibility and the inevitable differences between contracts, supplies and payments.
The Foundation Financial Regulation Regulation does not impose any external evaluation requirements on the Foundation.

DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/97 ANSWERS OF FUNCTIONING 3.15.8.
The Management Board is satisfied with the current consistency of the accounting officer, in particular with regard to his already existing powers to report directly to the Presidency in accordance with Article 6.1 of the Accounting Charter, as well as with regard to the participation of the Governing Board in the appointment procedure.
However, the new regulation on the delegation of tasks, which is currently being discussed between the institutions, is likely to assign the role played by the Administrative Board and not by the Director.
This will enable Eurofound to re-evaluate the issue of greater accounting independence in the future.
3.15.9.
However, two pilot agencies had serious problems with the software.
Furthermore, electronic procurement software is currently only available for open procurement (but not for negotiated tenders) from which Eurofound has little per year.
Eurofound will therefore continue to monitor developments and will be ready to invest in electronic public procurement as soon as it is satisfied with stability and functionality.

COMMENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF ACCOUNTS 3.16.10.
The Agency's seat has been relocated and has been re-established in 2013.
In 2014, the Agency modified its financial rules in 2014 and delegated its accounting function to the Commission's accounting officer in 2015.
Although these events have led to significant changes in the Agency's procedures, the invoicing system has not been re-approved since 2012 (138).

DE C 434/100 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 COMMENTS ON BUDGETARY EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT 3.16.11. The Agency shall publish notices of employment on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).
3.16.12.
In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in public procurement procedures (139) (140) in view of the fact that this requirement also applies to the EU institutions, and the Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT analysis covering all stages of the public procurement procedure.
The Commission has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic invitation to tender in the electronic version of the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic invoicing (2015).
At the end of 2017, the Agency did not use any of these tools.
External evaluation report 3.16.13.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/101 PL ANNEX Follow-up action in connection with the Court's observations in previous years Property fixed assets (net book value: EUR 1,0 million) are not insured.
The booking systems were last approved in 2012.
Systems have not been approved due to expected significant changes in procedures and information flows after the Agency's removal.
The new accountant plans the state-of-the-art validation for 2020.
The Agency has developed business continuity plans in France, the UK and the Netherlands.
However, there is no contingency plan for the seat in Prague and for the entire agency.
The Agency's annual work plan for 2015 was only adopted in March 2015 and its multiannual work programme for 2014-2020 has not yet been adopted.
The adoption of key planning documents risks achieving the objectives of the Agency.
In 2015, the Agency recorded a high staff fluctuations among 14 people who lost their jobs and 26 new employees.
In its evaluation report of November 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that no risk assessment was carried out across the Agency in 2016, and that no significant risks to the Agency were taken into account in its planning documents or in its risk assessment reports.
In addition, IAS concluded that the terminology used for the different elements of the performance measurement system is not uniform, which hinders the monitoring of performance.
The Agency and the IAS agreed on a corrective action plan for the period 2007-2013: EUR 2.8 million and 46% (EUR 2.5 million and 42% respectively in 2015) in Title II (administrative expenditure) for the financial year respectively.
DE C 434/102 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.16.10.
The GSA agrees with the Court's observations.
In 2015, the GSA issued its annual accounts to the European Commission so that the Commission's accounting officer (under DG Budget) provided all the services, including the validation of local systems, required under Article 50 of the Framework Financial Regulation applicable to the Agency under Article 50 of the Financial Regulation.
The concept of validation and its planning is currently underway under the Directorate-General for Budget.
3.16.11.
Publication of employment notices on the EPSO platform requires translation into all the official languages of the EU, while English is the only working language of the Agency, and the publication of job vacancies in the English language is considered a preliminary step in order to ensure that our working language is understood in the future.
Moreover, translating a job notice into all EU official languages would mean additional financial and temporary expenditure for the Agency, so that it does not benefit, even from the above mentioned areas, and instead the GSA intends to publish all the job notices on the Agency's portal, which the agencies consider equivalent to EPSO and which provides sufficient transparency for EU citizens.
In addition, the Agency shall publish its employment notices also on specialised space-related websites.
Electronic communications in TED (issued by the Authority on publication for publication) on the publication of contract notices, contract award notices, correction notices, change notices, etc., are currently used in the GSA, as indicated in Article 264 of the implementing rules.
The Agency also intends to use the TED e-Tendering system to create and publish calls for tenders.
In this context, GSA is currently working with the Publications Office to register and create a system account.
For high value tenders (over the thresholds set out in Article 118 (1) FR), the GSA is currently taking the necessary administrative steps to use the ăe-Submission module in the ăe-PRIO information system (at the disposal of DG DIGIT) developed by the European Commission to ensure that the electronic system to be set up for the submission of all tenders meets the specific requirements of the HO and AB.
It should be noted that the module ăe-Submission e currently only supports open procedures and therefore the GSA can only use it for these procedures.
In this context, GSA has already organised the first coordination meeting with DG DIGIT and is in the process of concluding and signing the agreement with DG DIGIT in order to define the framework and start their implementation.

COMMENTS ON THE ADAPTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.17.8.
As part of this type of work of the EU agencies, the Court has analysed the accounting, including the hierarchical position and non-compliance of their agencies.
The Director of the Agency's accounting department shall be the Director of the Administration department.
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET'S HOLDS AND THE CERTIFICATE OF CERTIFICATE 3.17.9. The EEA concluded that one of the European thematic centres (INTERNAL, CUSTOMER AND MARITIME PARTY) implemented the 2016 Action Plan with significant distortions.
Therefore, the Commission did not recognise some of the results and rejected some of the costs incurred by the SEI.
The correction of the amount of the final payment l does not mean that the financial controls and implementation checks for the grants for which the contribution has been made have been further improved.
3.17.10.
Several procurement procedures identified several cucumbers.
The Agency has used several calls for tenders which do not contain minimum requirements for economic and financial performance in relation to the selection criteria.
Therefore, on the basis of these criteria, To that end, on the basis of those criteria, To that end, on the basis of those criteria, it shall not decide, on the basis of the objective, whether the tenderer fulfils the necessary conditions for the performance of the contract.
3.17.11.
Price competition in certain high value tenders was based on offers on certain profiles of the day rather than on the expected duration of the tasks.
Framework agreements have been concluded with only one tenderer, although a renewed call for competition between the different tenderers to achieve better results for individual applications for the award of the contract.
3.17.12.
In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (147) (148). In view of the fact that such an obligation is in force for the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing all information data covering all stages of the procurement procedure, including tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of documents in procurement notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
3.17.13.
In particular, the decisions taken in the selection panel's minutes were not sufficiently taken into account.
The criteria applied at each stage of the selection procedure and the role of the individual members of the selection panel should be defined in greater detail in order to increase transparency and equal treatment of candidates.

COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.17.15
In order to implement the Copernicus agreement concluded with the Commission, the Agency undertook a number of legal commitments related to Copernicus before receiving pre-financing from the Commission.
Although these commitments were the subject of an exceptional report signed by the Director of the Agency, this approach constitutes an infringement of the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation.
The annex provides an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.
C 434/106 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations of previous years In 2016, the Agency updated its security concept, but many other internal procedures are obsolete.
The Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out an economic performance assessment (2015 Environmental Report) (SOER).
In 2014, the Commission concluded a framework agreement with the contractor. On behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including agencies) concerning the purchase of software and licences and related IT and advisory services.
In 2016, the Agency used this framework agreement to acquire a software licence of a total value of EUR 442 754.
This order concerned the renewal of the software license provided by the exclusive Canadian recuperator (112 248 euro).
In this case, there was no reasonable use of the framework agreement, which led to incomplete completion of the employment contract. In 2016 (completed/completed/completed) In 2016 (n.d.) In progress (n.d.) In progress (n.d.) in 2016 (n.a.) in 2016 there was no reasonable use of the framework agreement.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/107 REPLY OF THE AGENCY ON THE REPLY OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.17.8. The Agency has discussed the Court's observations with the Court of Auditors and is convinced that due to the fact that the valuer of the accounts is an employee who is an employee with a high salary (AD 12) and has direct access to the Management Board.
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY HOLDER AND THE RENDERING OF EXPENDITURE 3.17.9.
The Agency obliges the Court to further improve the management of the ETS network in both financial and operational controls.
In order to prevent the repetition in 2017 of the problem in the framework of the SIEC in relation to internal, fishing and marine resources, this task has been excluded from the annual action plan and has been delegated to the Agency.
The Agency shall endeavour to maintain the current level of control of the grants carried out under the SEI.

The Agency would like to reiterate that the decision to offer a framework for individual economic operators has been made consciously and consciously, taking into account the fact that competition is limited to the relevant points, as well as the nature and complexity of the services to be provided.
When awarding individual candidates under the financial framework, the Agency shall take account not only of the days agreed under the contract, but also of the number of days that require the tasks to be carried out to calculate the added value of budgetary appropriations for specific tasks.
Only then will negotiations begin with the contractor on the details of his offer, always paying attention to the best offer in terms of quality and price.
In the event of the reopening of the tendering procedure, the Agency shall not have the power to negotiate further tenders submitted by tenderers.
In accordance with the decision of the Governing Board of 9 November 2015 to introduce an obligation in the EEA to carry out electronic procurement procedures, it introduced certain electronic invoicing procedures in 2014 and is now extending the application of this module to all its procedures, and in 2014 it implemented all procurement procedures of a general nature from 1 January 2015 to all general contracts.
On 18 June 2018, the integration of the electronic submission of tenders started at the beginning of December 2017 and the first invitation to tender in which the module was used started on 18 June 2018 (EEA/COM/18/002.E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./COM/18/002.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A./E.A.A./E.A./E.A.A./E.A./E.A.A./E.I.
The Agency takes note of the Court's observations and takes note that it is currently adapting its selection and recruitment procedures to the following issues: (a) the execution of the various stages (selection, selection, application, written application) is best suited to the time (not only to the date). (b) For individual questions, the written application is systematically prepared at the pre-selection stage. (c) In order to improve reporting, electronic procedures (paper).
3.17.14.
EPSO rejected the publication to the Agency, together with the justification that the precondition that all job offers must be translated into all official languages is not met.
However, the Agency shall not use resources or resources to respond to EPSO's request.
In this case I am not only translating all job offers, but also translating offers in all official languages, which entails unacceptable high additional costs.
In this context, like most other EU agencies, the Agency has proven itself on the basis of an alternative to the EPSO website and has, since May 2018, used a website which has the same purpose as the EU Agency network.
In addition, LinkedIn uses its own website and Facebook sites to ensure the best dissemination.
DE C 434/108 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.17.15
Prior to the conclusion of the Copernicus Revenue Agreement with DG GROW, the Agency noted that the conditions for pre-financing are not in line with the Financial Regulation (Article 7 AR of the 2014 Financial Regulation).
DG GROW replied, but DG BUDG, responsible for preparing the standard template, refused to change the cost-sharing agreement.
After the start of the tax waiver agreement, the Agency continued to draw attention to the problems and explained that it was regularly forced to apply exceptions to continue operating, which eventually led DG GROW to change the pre-financing conditions of the tax waiver agreement in August 2017 and to make additional pre-financing payments in November 2017.

In December 2016, the Agency concluded a framework agreement with a contractor worth EUR 1.6 million and a period of four years for the provision of fixed-term services.
The only criterion of competition in the procurement procedure was the price.
A framework agreement with several companies selected on the basis of price and quality criteria would be better for the timely provision of quality services.

In 2013-2016, the number of employees from the host country increased from one to 16, representing 31% of the total workforce in 2016.
The low number of notifications from other Member States is the correction factor applicable to the remuneration of the host Member State (69%) and to competition with another EU institution based in Budapest.

DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/115 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.19.8.
CEPOL agrees with the Court's observations.
In 2014, CEPOL submitted to the European Commission the financial statements so that the Commission (in DG Budget) provided all the services, including the validation of local systems, required under Article 50 of the Framework Financial Regulation applicable to the agencies.
The validation approach is currently being discussed and planned within the services of the Directorate-General for Budget.
3.19.9.
The Agency took note of the Court's observations but disagrees with them.
The selection criteria are set out in the technical specifications and tenderers who were unable to meet the criteria are excluded.
The decision to grant a single framework agreement is based on the experience and characteristics of national labour markets.
The Agency took note of the Court's observations.
Brexit was discussed at meetings of the expert group and the discussions at NAPO (the Agency Network of Procurement Representatives) and IALN (the Agency Network) and in the communications sent by the Commission were closely monitored.
The risk of f in CEPOL was considered low, but was not officially documented.
The costs associated with the translation of notices into all EU official languages, as required by the publication on the EPSO website, are considered to be too high, taking into account the expected benefits.
From 2018, CEPOL will publish all open jobs also at the workplace, which is open to the agencies, developed by the network of EU agencies.
The Agency took note of the Court's observations and took note of the progress made in the electronic submission of tenders in cooperation with DG DIGIT.
3.19.13.
The Agency stresses progress in the implementation of the Action Plan, with two out of four recommendations being assessed by internal audit services as being implemented.

Since 2016, B.ro has been facing an unprecedented extension of tasks and opportunities to provide operational and technical support to Member States in the context of the migration crisis.
This reflects the increase in the budget from EUR 19 million in 2016 to EUR 79 million after the second change in the budget in 2017.
The number of procurement procedures increased from 87 in 2015 to 140 in 2017.
In 2015, payments increased by 25% from 2,578 to 8 381 in 2017.

B had already been unable to fill the posts provided for in his establishment plan.
Since 2014, the Court has regularly reiterated its point that B.4ro has been dealing with a large turnover of workers.
In its previous reports, the Court has repeatedly stressed that this situation poses a serious risk to the achievement of the objectives set out in the annual and multiannual work programmes.
Despite repeated attempts (36 recruitment procedures and 100 new recruitment procedures in 2017) B still failed to recruit and maintain employees in good faith (see also paragraph ă emphasising the circumstances in point 3.20.8).
3.20.13.
The overarching challenges of the operational migration crisis have not been addressed by a sound governance structure.
The Administrative Board has not set up an internal audit unit in B not subject to internal audit and activities in Greece and Italy have not been subject to internal audit.

As there was no competitive award procedure, the Court considered that the additional service contract in Greece was not in line with the rules in respect of additional service contracts in 2016.
However, in 2017, under this illegal contract, B continued to make payments of EUR 4.8 million in the amount of EUR 4.8 million.
DE C 434/120 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.20.18.
The procedures for the award of public service contracts (amount of payments in 2017: EUR 1.0 million) in Malta in 2017 were unacceptable (e.g. short time limits for the submission of tenders, lack of transparency in case of late payments), which affected competition in... one of the most important conditions for the award of public contracts.
Therefore, the procedures had to be repeated several times as no offers were received.

In 2017, B.ro directly awarded a service contract for advisory services related to the implementation of the action plan in the Greek islands.
The contract was awarded to a previously selected economic operator who did not benefit from any of the procurement procedures provided for in the Financial Regulation.
Therefore, the procurement procedure and all related payments (EUR 992000) were incompatible with the requirements.
3:20.30.
B has often changed the original contract concluded in 2016 with a law firm in the amount of EUR 5000 and increased it to EUR 259000 in 2018.
In 2017, H.H.H.H.H. made a payment of EUR 98332, partly in advisory services, which required a competitive procurement procedure.
The amendments and payments concerning these advisory services were therefore incompatible with the rules.

The elimination of the agreement concluded in 2013 (value: EUR 120 000, in 2017 increased to EUR 132 000) in connection with the organisation of four to six international hotel events over four years was not in line with the original subject-matter of the agreement.

Two of the three tenderers who participated in the public service contract procedure under the framework contract for the provision of services of EUR 4 million for the period 2016-2020 were asked to provide additional information on the same selection criteria.
Therefore, the 2016 Framework Agreement and the payments based on it from EUR 920 561 in 2016 in H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H. 561 are not in line with the requirements.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/123 Court's observations A framework agreement of a quarter of a year of EUR 3.6 million for ancillary services related to the eradication of the migration crisis was granted directly in February 2016.
The framework agreement was awarded to the pre-elected economic operator without the application of one of the procurement procedures provided for in the EU Financial Regulation and the award of the contract is therefore not in line with the relevant EU rules and the 2016 payments in H of EUR 592 273.
In August 2016, B.ro launched an open procedure (f.f.lose) to grant a framework agreement to meet the needs of cultural intermediaries/sellers in different countries.
The total value of the framework agreement for four granted and granted coupons (Lose 2-5) was EUR 60 million for four years.
However, this contractor met the financial requirements for the selection criteria (annual turnover of EUR 1 million) for only two years from the previous three years; in the second year, the joint organisation concluded an agreement on commitments whereby the turnover of EUR 1 million (loan) to the contractor (loan).
At the extraordinary European Council meeting on 23 April 2015 and in the ten-point migration plan adopted by the Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs Ministers on 20 April 2015, Member States were invited to ensure that all migrants take into account finger robberies.
This required the Greek State to purchase and supply 90 fingerprint scanners and 90 compatible computers (equipment) of EUR 1.1 million under the grant agreement concluded between the Commission and B toro.
However, there was no B staff on site but there was no place to meet this requirement. However, there was no strong Greek staff on this subject, that the equipment was delivered to hotspots in February and in early March 2016 and was delivered to its intended purpose only in July 2017.

In its evaluation report of October 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) underlined the lack of adequate planning of procurement procedures for administrative expenditure and the lack of supervision of both procedures and individual procurement applications.
In 2016, B.ro faced various challenges in the operational environment, which meant not only a significant increase in its budget and its tasks, but also a significant increase in the number of introductions, the renewal of its accounting composition with several transitional periods, as well as the introduction of a paperless system.

The Court rightly points out that the human situation in Bowara has deteriorated and is insufficient and that it is also an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal control system.
The current human resources situation is one of the main challenges of resolving the problems identified by the Court in its observations, which can largely be seen as a result of a lack of resources within the framework of a structured and regulatory action.

3.20.9. and 3.20.19.
The Court correctly describes the difficulties and, in absolute terms, the rapid increase in financial transactions and procurement procedures.
These figures speak in clear language, but in principle they do not speak ad-quat in finance and in procurement.
These data do not take into account other facts and measures which, such as the two aspects, do not take into account the need to award contracts, such as the inclusion of externally funded experts (Articles 204 and 287 of the Financial Regulation), which are a heavy burden for the public procurement sector.
In the coming years, the situation can be expected to deteriorate further, as B as regards medical information for the countries of origin B as regards B as regards the deterioration of the situation will have to ask the [medical] experts to assist in the performance of medical information tasks.

In the rural regions of Italy and Greece, the conditions for a competitive market for services and products are not very good for services and products for B are not very good.
Moreover, B is not a typical customer with regard to the volume of service contracts in Malta, as in most cases they lack service contracts in order to meet the requirements of more service contracts.

This feature is important, as important as the important administrative importance, as well as the importance, as well as the most important, important, important, important, important, important, important, as well as important
It should also be noted that B, because of its operational functionality, geographical coverage and (as the Court rightly states), restrictions on the use of experts from the Member States on an inappropriate scale depend on contractors.
This is a factor that increases the scope of procurement and financing tasks (including decentralised financial entities), given that in Greece, Italy and Cyprus:

Moreover, B disagrees with the claim that legal services must always be strictly represented by B not only by individuals but not by individuals (which does not exclude each other).
B disagrees that the inclusion of external legal services has not been adequately controlled.
The Court has stated in its report that further internal investigations are being carried out in this case and that the results are communicated to the Court.

These corrective measures were indisputably triggered following the Court's finding of irregularities in the 2016 Restructuring Report (entry into the Court's report in September 2017).
Unfortunately, in 2017, due to the deadlines and the fact that B due to the fact that B due to the lack of legal compliance, B soon replaced the Vertridge, there was in fact a payment under the contract.
3.20.18. and 3.20.19.
B disagrees with the comments and recalls that these problems can be seen as the result of insufficient resources and of the problems of internal control and management that the Court has identified in its report.

As the Court states in its report, an internal investigation is currently being carried out in this case.

In May 2015, the provisional Director of the Centre was appointed by a decision of the Management Board.
By 31 December 2016, that post was filled for a period of one year by eight months as referred to in the Staff Regulations.
At the same time, in 15 other implementing rules, for other employees.
In its evaluation report of October 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed that, despite the continued activities of the Centre to interpret its internal audit of public procurement, significant restrictions on public procurement continue to exist.
The IAS concluded that the planning and monitoring of procurement procedures are weak and that procurement procedures are not always covered by the annual work programme or financing decision.
In addition, it refers to the Court's report on the Centre's 2015 accounts and the Centre's 2015 accounts, which affect the transparency of procurement procedures.
The Centre and IAS have agreed on a corrective action plan.
As in previous years, Title III (operational expenditure) (EUR 7,9 million and 41% (EUR 7,5 million in 2015 and 42% in 2015 respectively) and Title III (operational expenditure) made commitments of EUR 7,9 million and 41% (EUR 7,5 million and 42% in 2015 respectively).
This appropriation is intended primarily to cover multi-annual projects relating to scientific advice (EUR 2.4 million), supervision (EUR 1.3 million), public health training (EUR 1.4 million) and public health IT applications (EUR 2.1 million).
The Centre can more effectively implement separate budget appropriations to better meet the multi-annual nature of the experience, as well as the inevitable fluctuations between contracts, supplies and payments.
(1) After the selection procedure, the interim director was appointed director in 2017.
The Centre has introduced new IT tools to improve the planning and monitoring of procurement procedures.

COMMENTS ON ACCOUNTING GOODNESS 3.22.8
The Head of Administration/corporate Services Department is Beh's Head of Accounting/corporate Services.
In May 2017, on behalf of the nine agencies participating in the tender, Beh... concluded three framework agreements in the cascade system, covering a wide range of services.
Although procurement procedures involving the Agency provide a good capacity to improve administrative efficiency in the case of procurement procedures for which a specific service is not known at the time of the call for tenders, framework contracts for which each contract is re-called for to apply for a contract are more appropriate to achieve a good level of costs and benefits than framework contracts in the cascade system.
REPORTS FROM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICE 3.22/10.
In 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service presented an evaluation report evaluating the evaluation procedure for regulated products/evaluation phase for the marketing of products (175).
As part of the action plan to be implemented in areas where there is a likelihood of a need to improve the situation, corrective action is needed.

C 434/134 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up action in relation to the observations of the previous years of the Court of Justice of Bierzerde has not yet developed a clear and comprehensive ex-post financial control strategy that would cover all areas of activity and would be defined in the scope and scope of these audits.
In its annual report of November 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the existing IT project management controls are appropriate but indicated that the IT project management controls are significant.
In 2015, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2015/1333 [2] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2015 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2020 and for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2020 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2020 to 25 January 2015 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2015 appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 January 2015 to 25 January 2015 to 25 January 2020.

EFSA confirms the inconsistencies of the Court's opinion on the inconsistencies of the accounts as well as on the legality and regularity of the accounts on which the annual accounts are based.
3.22.8.
In order to ensure consistency of the accounts, the formal requirement laid down in the EFSA financial rules was implemented by EFSA in 2008 and the current clearing requirement was laid down by the EFSA Administrative Board.
In order to ensure functional non-compliance of the accounting officer with the evaluation procedures, the head of the BUS department shall act as the assessor and the chairman of the Preparatory Committee shall act as the evaluation staff member.
The Director may be revoked at any time by the Management Board before or after the termination of his duties.
3.2.2.9.
For individual invitations to tender in a cascade system, there is no obligation to use the model of individual invitations to tender, and both models may be appropriate depending on the scenario in question.
EFSA considers that the individual requirements for standard services that have been re-notified for the competition are more appropriate and are used in EFSA statistical services, systematic monitoring of literature and research of target groups.
EFSA uses the cascade model in relation to the situation in which the long-term contract relationship is in the first place.
In particular, in the context of the Framework Agreement on environmental services in the framework of external services, the aim is to: (i) to ensure an adequate understanding of the competences of EFSA; (ii) to ensure a coherent environmental method; and (iii) to ensure credibility at all levels of administration.
EFSA has control over budgetary resources for proposals which the contractor has in the cascade system.
3.22/10.
EFSA will implement an action plan for the assessment of regulated products/evaluation phase for the approval of antimicrobials agreed following the publication of the IAD.

The following observations do not call into question the Court's opinion.
The Institute was sued at the end of the financial year 2017 in four cases brought before the court by the unsuccessful tenderers in connection with the three procurement procedures.
In each of these cases, the applicant has requested the annulment of the award decision and the award of compensation.
The resulting compensation claim in these four cases amounts to EUR 700 000 and 9% of the Institute's annual budget respectively.
According to the evaluation of the Institute's external lawyer, the risk position of EUR 75 000 (or 1% of the institution's annual budget) was entered in the accounts of EUR 75 000 to cover the expected losses.
The judgment given by the Court of First Instance in each of these cases will determine the correctness and regularity of the procurement procedures of the Court of First Instance and the future payments.
In 2016, the Institute organised an open call for offers for tourism services.
The descriptions and valuation process did not provide sufficient guarantee of the best price to the price.
The tender formula and the pricing mechanism could not be used as they did not allow a proper assessment of the tenders submitted by the tenderers.
The framework agreement was concluded for a period of four years and for a sum of EUR 700.000.
In 2017, payments of EUR 137 000 were made in H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.

In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in the procurement procedures (180) (181). Therefore, in view of the application of the rules for the EU institutions to this end, the Commission is currently developing all information data covering all stages of the procurement procedure, launching tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) of the procurement notices and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
According to the Commission, the Institute has launched some electronic invoicing procedures by the end of 2017 but has not launched an electronic invitation to tender and tender.

The Institute may use separate budgetary resources to better reflect the multi-annual nature of the experience and the inevitable discrepancies between contracts, supplies and payments.
In 2016, the Institute launched an open call for tender for a framework agreement to maintain and update its instruments and sources of gender statistics at the level of EUR 1.6 million.
At the request of the tenderer, the institution explained on its website that the maximum amount per lot was EUR 800,000.
However, two separate framework agreements with the same tenderer were concluded at the level of EUR 1,6 million per lot, with the possibility of further acquiring up to 50% per lot, allowing the institution to deduct up to EUR 4,8 million or three times the amount indicated in the contract notice during the entire duration of the framework contract (up to four years).
In 2016, payments were made in H in H. 920 euro.
In response to the recommendation of the Institut Nochr Institut Institut Institut Institut Institutr on the two legal frameworks, which reduced the level of H to EUR 800000 (up to 50%).
In the call for tender under the negotiated procedure with one tenderer for service contracts for the handling and handling of IT tools and databases, the base price under the negotiated procedure was limited to EUR 81 000 (excluding VAT) and it was established that for tenders that were not fully taken into account, the price of H under the negotiated procedure was limited to EUR 81 000 (excluding VAT).
However, after receiving offers of two of the three required benefits, the institution concluded a contract for the provision of services of EUR 97 410.
In 2016, H in H in H in H in the amount of EUR 73 057 was paid.

The EIG takes note of this remark.
In order to minimise the risk of potential legal disputes and possible dissatisfaction in the case of rejected candidates, in the context of the procurement procedure, the Court examined the disadvantages and modified the procurement procedures, irrespective of the decisions of the Court of First Instance in these cases.
3.23.9.
EIGE takes note of and stresses that there are internal controls to review and control the prices of the flights and hotels that the contractor has submitted.
Within the network of EU agencies, the EIG will address this issue in order to exchange best practice examples.
In addition, EIGE expressed its interest in participating in a joint tender procedure organised by the Commission services (PMO).
Following the award of the EIGE contract, the EIGE intends not to lose the existing framework agreement on travel services, accommodation and services to be provided.
It is expected that these modules in the EIGE will be fully implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
Given the limited number of procedures and the high costs associated with the services, the EIG decided that this option would not take the basis of economics and inefficiencies.
In the light of the information provided by interested parties regarding the information provided in all 24 official EU languages, and the fact that, in the case of certain job vacancies, due to their particular nature, it is recommended to publish information on other jobs due to the fact that the channels that are currently using their job offers ensure adequate transparency and publication.
3.23.12.
In line with the recommendations in the Progress Report, the EIGE has developed an action plan, which is regularly updated and updated.
The agreed deadline for all actions will be set at 31 December 2018 and implementation is already very advanced.

COMMENTS ON THE COMPLIANCE OF ACCOUNTS 3.24.11.
At the Agency, the head of the financial department is the head of the financial department.
3.24.12.
Moreover, since 2014, the Agency has been entrusted with two thorough restructuring tasks, while the Agency has been entrusted with new, comprehensive tasks (see paragraphs 3.2.4.15 to 3.24.17). Although these events have led to changes in the Agency's procedures and clearing system, the invoicing system has not been re-approved since 2013.
The Agency shall publish employment notices on its own website, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (ESSO). This will lead to transparency and publication on its website, and will enable citizens and citizens to read employment notices from various EU agencies and institutions.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/143 3.24.
In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (187) (188). Therefore, as this requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing all IT data covering all stages of the procurement procedure. The Commission has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Agency launched an electronic invitation to tender for certain procedures but not for electronic invoicing and electronic invoicing.
Management of advisory services 3.2.4.15.
The previous year examined how the Agency manages advisory services, including two selected projects for the implementation of the Pharmacovigilance Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (189) and the Clinical Trial Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (190)) which required the establishment of complex networks across the EU, required a significant development of information technology.
Since the number of posts in the Agency's establishment plan was not established, which meant that it was created to its own extent to obtain the necessary expertise, the Agency took action to carry out these tasks in consulting firms.
However, using consulting companies critically forced the Agency to abandon this external expertise in a critical way.
3.24.16.
To re-control projects, the Agency has identified what functions are not outsourced but must be carried out internally.
In addition, the Agency shall seek to ensure that the advisers no longer grant time and resources on the basis of criteria, but on the basis of fixed prices.
The Commission has also introduced a more appropriate procedure for approving changes to the project.
3.24.17.
It will take some time to reduce the Agency's critical dependence on consulting companies, and the effects of the actions will only be discovered over the years.
One of the two major projects of 2016, the pharmacovigilance project (EudraVigilance database with unnoticed pharmaceutical effects), was completed in 2017 with an additional cost of around EUR 0.5 million.
There is still work on the project for clinical trials. There is no deadline for starting the activity, but in 2017 the budget was increased by another EUR 4.9 million (191).

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/145 PL ANNEX Follow-up action in relation to the Court's observations in previous years The Regulation on the powers of the Agency sets the time limits within which to take part in the reimbursement of applications and the related payments of the Agency to the largest national officials ((1). For most of the Court's applications, these time limits have not been respected.
In 2014, the Agency carried out an administrative procedure against its employees in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT).
Since the introduction of the new IT accounting system in 2011, reporting on responsibilities has not been sufficiently transparent and has not been sufficiently transparent for the Committee.
The Agency has concluded agreements with 25 London hotels on trade and trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade-trade with 25 hotels.
The six agreements on trade tariffs and payments in 2016 in H.H.he, amounting to around EUR 2.1 million, are therefore incompatible with the rules.
In 2014, on behalf of more than 50 EU institutions and bodies (including the Agency), the Commission concluded a framework agreement with the contractor on the purchase of software and licences and related IT and advisory services.
In 2016, a payment of EUR 8.9 million in H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.

The Agency did not systematically agree with prices and charges with suppliers' offers and did not systematically verify the invoices issued to the contractor of the framework contract.
C 434/146 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's observations Since 2014 the Agency has been thoroughly restructured, with high and medium positions being restructured internally.
The implementation of key IT and administrative staff has failed, which has exposed the Agency and its staff to a serious risk of instability.
Moreover, there is no system of analysis of the opportunities, the identification of opportunities, the recruitment and the allocation of the relevant staff.

The Parliament and the Council have entrusted the Agency with the implementation of the Pharmacovigilance Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012) and Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014), which requires the establishment of complex networks across the EU.
Those tasks were delegated to the Agency on the date on which, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 on budgetary discipline, a reduction of its staff was expected.
The number of posts in the Agency's establishment plan has not been established, which has enabled it to obtain the necessary expertise in the field of enterprise and information technology development.
Large use of external advisors As only 13 employees were employed in the IT-Delivery Department, the Agency used consulting companies in the field of business analysis, information technology, project management and quality assurance.
In the second quarter of 2016, the Agency..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

From the very beginning of the projects, the Agency is therefore dependent on external expertise, but not on a strategy that regulates the use of consultants.
Insufficient control of the development and implementation of the project When the Agency received new tasks in 2012 and 2014, it did not use the appropriate project management method under this Regulation.
In 2014, a new method was introduced which required a substantial review in September 2016.
Ongoing (see paragraphs [3.24.15-3.24.17])
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/147 PL Court's observations Several interested parties withdrew their planned or planned actions prior to their approval on the basis of the formal amendment procedure.
By mid-2016 all external advisers had closed down the Vertridge on the basis of time and resources, although the results of the project were clearly defined.
Depleting and increasing costs During the development of systems, the Agency faced growth and costs.
Several changes in the size, budget and timing of the projects concerned, in particular, repeated adjustments to the system requirements in order to meet the changing needs of the Member States[2].

DE C 434/148 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.24.8.
3.24.11.
The Agency shall respect the financial rules of the EMA: the Agency shall already be appointed by the Management Board pursuant to Article 50 (1) of the EMA Financial Regulation and the Management Board pursuant to Article 50 (1) of the EMA Financial Regulation pursuant to Article 50 (1) of the Financial Regulation and the Management Board shall be appointed pursuant to Article 50 (1) of the EMA Financial Regulation pursuant to Article 50 (1) of the Financial Regulation.
This disagreement is still transparent, signed by the President and the Director-General.
The approval of the Agency's invoicing systems was launched in March 2018.
3.24.13.
EMA offers transparency and publication, because, depending on the profile, EMA, LinkedIn, agencies or specialist publications, it has access or access to them.
As a result, the EMA has a strong interest among candidates across the EU, with over 1000 candidates participating in some competitions.
In addition, the general implementing rules for the recruitment and use of temporary staff provide that the decisions concerning the selection of temporary staff referred to in Article 2 (f) of the CJR are to be published only in the Agency's working languages and that the agencies that do not have a permanent working language are to publish the selection decisions in all the official languages of the European Union.
As a result of a decision of the Administrative Director, issued by the Management Board, the working language of the EMA has been English since June 2015.
EPSO, however, informed EMA that it still requires EMA to translate the notices into all the official EU languages and to allow the translation of these language versions on the EMA website.
It should be noted that tenders for posts in all official EU languages have a significant impact on the duration of the competitions and involve higher costs.
3.2.4.14.
By the end of 2017, the Agency of f.j.r. conducted an electronic invitation to tender and all procedures below the specified limit for the submission of e-mail offers.
Although the Agency has not introduced electronic invoicing or electronic submission of tenders, in September 2017, the Agency signed an agreement with the European Commission on access to and use of electronic submission of tenders and expects the European Commission to indicate the deadline for the submission of tenders.
The Agency confirms the Court's recognition that the EMA has implemented several important actions to respond to the Court's 2016 audit observations on the management of advisory services.
In the case of the two projects referred to, it was concluded that due to the complications of the co-system of interests and the system to be set up, in the case of clinical projects, in the case of clinical projects, in the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, Republic, the Republic, the Czech Republic, Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, the Republic, Republic, the Czech Republic, Republic, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic, Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Czech Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, Kingdom, Kingdom, Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, Kingdom, the United Kingdom,

At the end of 2015, the total amount of payments referred to in this Treaty was EUR 382 181, which means that the ceiling was increased by 50%.
For two legal frameworks worth EUR 135 000 or EUR 650 000, one of the Centre's officials acted in the case of the appointment of an evaluation committee, the decision on accession and the signing of the Vertragge as an authorised authorising officer.
However, the powers conferred by the authorising officer were limited to EUR 130000 and were not exhausted.
In 2016, a payment of EUR 35 310 in H whe was made.
In its evaluation report of January 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) stressed that the Centre must improve the management of IT projects.
In particular, the IAS concluded that the long-term, strategic, holistic, IT systems that support the Centre's central operating system lacked that the Centre's IT project management methodology was only partially adapted to its needs, and that the system requirements management procedure was unacceptable.
The Centre and IAS agreed on a corrective action plan for the period 2007-2013.
DE C 434/152 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 ANSWERS OF THE CERTIFICANT AUTHORITY 3.25.8. The Centre considers that the current organisational structure does not adversely affect the non-compliance of its accounting officers.
Rather, this non-compliance has been consistently ensured in accordance with the relevant provisions, in particular by the appointment by the Centre's Board of Auditors, the responsibility and functional responsibility of such officials in relation to the Management Board and, in particular, by careful compliance with the provisions on the allocation of tasks of the various financial entities of the Centre.
In this context, the Centre is ready to comply with the Court's recommendation and to ensure that the relevant actions comply with the organisation's scope and are effective and effective.
3.25.9.
The Centre shall publish its recruitment notices as a standard also through the dissemination of information on the members of its management bodies, the national contact points participating in the Reitox programme and the EU agencies responsible for the dissemination of information on the subject.
In addition, the Centre's state-of-the-art competitions are also published on the Agency's portal on job offers. The EU Agency Network has developed this common online platform to increase the visibility of the Agency's recruitment procedures.
In this context, the Centre will launder the costs and benefits of the additional publication on the EPSO portal.
The Centre shall meet the requirements for electronic procurement procedures in accordance with the agreed EU legal framework and the EU timetable for electronic procurement procedures.
As early as August 2015, in cooperation with the relevant services of the European Commission, the Centre established, in cooperation with the relevant services of the European Commission, a technical configuration/tool for information and communication technologies, which in the field of electronic invoicing (offered by DG DIGIT of the European Commission in order to develop the DG DIGIT framework).
In addition, in 2017, the Centre planned the preparatory actions necessary for the use of the electronic call for tenders and the submission of tenders in electronic form, in accordance with the above-mentioned legal framework, as from October 2018.
The implementation of this plan is ongoing and the Centre expects it to meet this deadline without serious problems.

GENERAL AGENCY OF EUROPE GENERAL AGENCY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE (EU-LISA) INTRODUCTION 3.26.1.
The European Agency for the Operational Management of Information Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) with its seat in Tallinn and its locations in Stra§burg and St. Johann im Pongau) was established by Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (201).
The Agency's main task is to manage the operational management of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and the European fingerprint comparison system (Eurodac).

Payments Judgment on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts 3.26.6.
3.26.7.
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY HOLDER AND THE CERTIFICATE 3.268. In 2017, the Agency had difficulties in obtaining a sufficient number of tenderers in the case of a number of medium-value contracts.
3.269.
The Agency currently manages three separate non-integrated IT systems (SIS II, VIS and Eurodac) that process all data on EU policies on freedom, security and justice.
Such an approach could make it difficult for the Agency to achieve economies of scale and synergies between different systems.
The current discussions on extending the mandate of the Agency in the coming years to manage several additional IT systems confirm the growing urgency of the problem.
The Agency should, in consultation with the Commission and the Member States, conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis in order to contribute to the discussion on a future system development strategy.
3.26.10.
The project of building a new building in Stra§burg has developed to a large extent.
Although the Agency had already paid the full price for construction work in 2016, the work had still not been completed by the end of 2017 and the progress reports which had been completed covered only around 70% of the work.
Some of the Agency's staff have already received new information, although the work is still ongoing.
The Agency and the contractor blame each other for the misunderstandings. In December 2017, the contractor submitted financial applications to the Agency and submitted a complaint.
The Agency shall exercise its rights vis-à-vis the contractor (205).
3.26.11.
3.26.12.
In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for the electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in the procurement procedures (206) and, in view of the fact that the rules for the EU institutions apply for this purpose, the Commission is currently developing a whole IT covering all stages of the procurement procedure, including the tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).
Consulting 3.26.13.
The Agency shall mainly use advisory services related to IT projects by its nature.
According to the Agency's records, IT projects were implemented in 2017 under the financial and time framework.
For several projects relating to the maintenance of development-related projects which were not in line with the time schedule of the proceedings, exceptional reports were prepared.
(205) See also the Agency's annual accounts for 2017, Section 2.1.5 ăEvents after the end of the reporting period. (206) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013, Article 79 Electronic management (ăe-Government.)
(207) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95 (2) of the eGovernment (ăe-Government.)
EN 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/155 3.26.14.
The Agency shall use the outsourcing model to develop and implement IT projects using approximately 90% of the relevant contractors' work.
There are three main framework agreements with three consortia, one of each system.
The payments made for these framework agreements in 2017 amounted to EUR 3 million for Eurodac, EUR 16 million for SIS II and EUR 13 million for VIS.
Although all stages of IT projects, from the definition of requirements and intermediate objectives to the start-up of new elements of the system, are owned and controlled by the Agency, the model under which such sensitive IT systems are contracted in this area poses a serious risk in terms of the risk that the contractors will be dependent on each other.
This is all the more important in view of the limited number of potential contractors who could cope with these systems and these requirements, both from the point of view of activity and security.

COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.26.17.
The Agency has undertaken global commitments of EUR 69.9 million to cover additional expenditure related to new tasks and IT systems to be transferred in 2017 but which have not adopted the legal basis by the end of the year (transformation of Eurodac and the allocation system to Dublin) or recently (Regulation of 30 November 2017 on the Entry/Exit System).
The corresponding payment appropriations were used in two amending budgets of EUR 85.6 million, from EUR 153.3 million in the budget, which was originally approved, to EUR 85.6 million in the budget which was finally adopted.
INTERNAL INTERNAL SERVICE REPORTS 3.26.18.
In December 2017, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) submitted to the Commission an evaluation report evaluating the audit of procurement procedures under eu-LISA (209).
The Agency has developed an action plan to take corrective action in areas where there is a risk that there is a need for improvement.

The Agency has concluded a framework agreement of EUR 2 million for services related to service contracts provided by the provider for training, training and education services provided by third parties (training contracts).
In 2016, the Agency received and accepted goods worth €2.8 million which did not entail legal obligations and obligations.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/157 EN The observations of the Court of the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) in their July 2016 review report recognised that the overall structure and practical implementation of the procedures ensure that eu-LISA operates the SIS II, VIS and Eurodac information systems in such a way as to enable national operators using such systems to continuously and continuously exchange data.
In Title II (administrative expenditure) the appropriations allocated for the following financial year amount to EUR 5 million and 63% respectively (EUR 9 million and 50% respectively in 2015).
In June 2015, the Agency closed an order for construction in Stra§burg for an amount of EUR 21.5 million.
At one of the meetings of the Agency's Management Board in 2016, the Commission's representative raised the issue of increasing the cost of living.
Although cost increases can be explained, for example, by the continuous development and the extended functions of the systems, the Court concluded that public procurement procedures for which the Agency did not verify that the most costly cost was earmarked for this purpose.
For example, the Agency has acquired a new software licence under a framework agreement of EUR 4.6 million without verifying that the contractor of the framework agreement, the intermediary between the Agency and the potential software provider, has obtained the best price.
In May 2016, the Agency concluded a framework agreement with the consortium of EUR 194 million on the further development and maintenance of the Visa Information System (VIS) and the Information System (VIS) for the comparison of biometric data for a period of up to six years.

The evaluators made 64 recommendations for further improvement of operational management, seven of which are considered crucial and eleven are very important.
The Agency has drawn up a plan for implementing the recommendations which is currently being implemented.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/159 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY 3.26.8.
In the case of medium value contracts, the Agency shall regularly publish ex ante notifications on its website in accordance with Article 103 (2) of the Financial Regulation.
In December 2017, the Commission presented two proposals for a Regulation establishing a framework for interoperability between the EU information systems (border and visa systems and police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration).
In addition, the review of the mandate of the Agency (in recent phases to be adopted) sets out how the interoperability measures to be adopted, including legislative proposals, will be developed.
The Agency has so far introduced its technical knowledge and know-how to the discussion of the High Level Expert Group on Information Systems and Interoperability.
At the same time, a study (which has not yet been completed) has been carried out to obtain a clear picture of the potential architecture of interoperable information systems.
The study also includes a reduction of impacts, as well as a migration and integration plan, including interoperability elements in existing and potential systems.
The Agency is best aware of the construction project in Stra§burg.
Move staff to the new B to the new B near B not far from where the job was done.
Construction works in another building are related to the data center and are still ongoing.
In order to legal support for this construction contract, the Agency has signed an agreement with an external law firm.
It points out that job offers are included on the EU network website and on the EU Training website on the EU website.
However, additional funding is needed to take into account the EPSO language system, according to which employment notices must be translated into all EU languages (e.g. the cost of translating the employment notice into all EU languages is EUR 12 000).
As regards the electronic submission of tenders, due to technical problems, the tool could not be used on the platform managed by DG DIGIT of the Commission, and therefore, like other agencies, the Agency was not able to make full use of the platform in 2017.
Once the platform is stable, the Agency intends to use it in its orders.
3.26.13.
The Agency takes note of the findings, the Agency aims to further reduce the number of projects that are not in line with the timetable and has therefore started to implement actions to improve the planning process (see also the statement 3.26.16).
In line with the key performance indicators of the Agency (point 22) contained in the consolidated annual report for 2017, in relation to the quality, cost and time parameters, completed projects in 2017 in relation to the quality, time and time parameters, in relation to the 10% target, in relation to the target of 8,79 %.
In addition, in 2017, the project management method was adapted and updated by eu-LISA in order to adapt it to the PRINCE2 strategy and method.
In order to improve the reporting and allocation of resources across the Agency, the Enterprise Project project management tool has also been introduced.
3.26.14.
The Agency shall best take into account the high participation of external contractors in IT projects (operational and organisational).
This high outsourcing rate is directly linked to Commission Communication COM (2013) 519 on the financial and staff planning of decentralised agencies in the period 2014-2020.
In 2012, the establishment plan did not provide for sufficient posts for the tasks entrusted to the Agency.
Furthermore, the Agency's tasks have been significantly increased since 2013, but its requests for additional staff have been rejected and the Agency has had to reduce the number of staff (a total of seven posts), as required by the Commission Communication.
In order to ensure the proper allocation of tasks, the contractors involved in quality assurance shall not provide external support services for the management of operational IT systems.
The Agency welcomes this extraordinary situation in which the staff member had to take up additional tasks in the first place.
The appointment was forced because of the long absence of the Head of Operations because of the ongoing recruitment procedure because of the further vacant position.
In order to remedy this situation, the Agency has appointed another employee, the Head of Unit ăSecurity, as the first-rate Head of Unit ăSecurity and Infrastructure as Head of Unit ăSecurity and Infrastructure until, on 1 July 2018, the renewed driving force has gained momentum.
DE C 434/160 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 3.26.16.
Changes to the system at the start of the tendering procedure can only be described in a nutshell and a specific change should be negotiated when the requirements are known (e.g. when the legal basis of the schemes changes).
In the framework of the review of the procurement strategy, the Agency will address the options for public procurement, including the adoption of the IFPUG method, in order to reduce the dependence on one economic operator in terms of development.
The Commission's Internal Audit Action Plan (IAS) in 2017 contains elements relevant to this remark.
3.26.17.
The scenario and related risks were already identified in 2016 and included in the estimates of the Agency's revenue and expenditure for 2017 and 2017.
As a result of the reluctance to accept the legal basis of the new tasks, the Management Board was informed throughout the year of the risks and risks associated with the adoption of major global commitments.

Title II (support expenditure for the financial year) for the financial year 2015 recorded a high percentage of the appropriations for that financial year, i.e. EUR 6446530, i.e. 40% (EUR 1,6 million and 22% respectively in 2015).
This appropriation is intended mainly to cover work beyond the end of the year and the purchase of muzzles which were commissioned in preparation for the transfer of Eurojust to new jobs in 2017 (EUR 4 867 482).
2011 2016 The new Eurojust regulation is still under review by the legislator.

Europol employs 220 liaison officers from EU Member States and third countries and organisations.
Europol's common working language is English and therefore Europol's internal language rules adopted by the Management Board provide that, unless otherwise agreed, recruitment procedures should be conducted in English.
Therefore, employment notices shall be published by Europol in English.
Europol uses an effective and transparent recruitment process and uses a job vacancy rate of 0% at the end of 2017. There were an average of 58 candidates for the selection process in 89 recruitment procedures at the end of 2017.

COMMENTS ON THE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF THE ACCOUNT 3.29.8.
At the Agency, the head of the corporate services department is the head of the invoicing department.
In 2017, the Agency encountered difficulties in purchasing research due to unrealistic market collapse.
At least three open invitations to tender failed because the Agency only received tenders of the required quality which significantly exceeded the maximum agreed value of the contract.

In the framework of the framework Financial Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (224) (225) in view of the fact that such a requirement also applies to EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing all the information data covering all stages of the procurement procedure. The Commission has launched tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015).

Title III (operational expenditure) includes expenditure incurred (EUR 5.2 million and EUR 68%) respectively, EUR 5.7 million and EUR 70% in 2015.
This is mainly about the way studies are conducted, which are financed within a few months and often within a few months, as well as within a year.

After the restructuring of the Agency, which will be completed by the end of 2018, the accounting officer's position will be subject to the administrative responsibility of the Director and will be directly subject to the Management Board (as always).
In order to maintain the existing synergies, the accounting officer will continue to cooperate closely with the Corporate Services Department.
3.29.9.
All studies were publicly announced and were therefore considered justified.
Large studies carried out by the FRA are quite unique in the EU, both in terms of the subject matter and in terms of the need to study in all EU Member States.
In addition, the Agency has limited resources for these activities.
However, in the case of such tenders, the Agency shall consider carrying out market tests and, if necessary, reconsider the technical requirements and, if necessary, re-evaluate the priority of the tests to be carried out.
Whether or not this problem is much easier to describe if the operational expenditure for this purpose is greater.
The Agency started implementing such systems in 2018, which will be available within the deadline.

The new Rural Regulation extends the Agency's powers and entrusts the Agency with the task of ensuring integrated management of external borders at European level in order to effectively manage external borders.
This involves balancing migration pressures and potential potential threats at these borders, while at the same time contributing to the fight against serious cross-border crimes to ensure a high level of internal security in the Union, in full respect of fundamental rights and respect for freedom in this area.

Payments Judgment on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts 3.30.6.
Note 3.307.
The Agency's grant expenditure increased significantly from EUR 123 million for 2016 to EUR 167 million for 2017.
In contrast to previous years, the Agency has not carried out ex-post ex-post controls on the expenditure related to grants in 2017.
The Commission considers that ex ante ex-ante-e-e-e-refund has been improved and that, as soon as they reach a certain level of security, the level of security is necessary.
However, since 2014, the Court has repeatedly stated that the cooperating countries will often not provide sufficient evidence of the expenditure they have invoked, which was not the case (see paragraphs 3.30.12 to 3.30.13).
3.30.8.
In 2016, the Court recommended the Agency to carry out a detailed analysis of the most appropriate financial mechanism (233).
The Court therefore concludes that, at the end of 2017, the Administrative Board decided to use unit costs instead of reimbursement of actual operating costs.
At the same time, a pilot project was launched in 2018 to determine unit costs for the cooperating countries.
In June 2017, the Administrative Board also approved the Agency's new organisational structure, which will apply from 2018, including the creation of a new inspection and control, which will report directly to the Executive Director and the Management Board to adapt the organisation to the new mandate (see paragraph 3.30.9).
3.30.9.
The mandate of the Agency was significantly extended in 2016 following the migration crisis facing the Union.
The Agency's budget increased by 75% in 2016 and the 2017-2017 budget increased again by 21% compared to the previous year.
In 2016, the number of employees increased by 18% and by 43% compared to the previous year.
Work is still underway to adapt systems and procedures to the new mandate and new conditions.
The following comments do not undermine the Court's opinion and should be read in the light of the challenges the Agency had to address.
COMMENTS ON JUSTICE AND JUSTICE IN INTRODUCTION 3.30.10.
Following an open call for tenders, the Agency received four technical assistance offers for the assistance of migrants in Greece.
After the selection, three offers were maintained and one was excluded.
The only award criterion was the price.
In April 2017, the Agency signed a framework agreement for a period of three years with a company that offered the lowest price.
However, the customer was seasonally limited and had problems with obtaining the order, so that the agency executed the order at the end of 2017.
In order to ensure continuity of services, the Agency signed a new framework agreement of EUR 1,8 million with the tenderer, which was second in November 2017, which offered the second lowest price by the end of 2017.
The Commission did not negotiate the terms of the replacement agreement with the tenderers in second and third place, but signed a new agreement on the basis of the initial offer submitted by the second tenderer.
The direct award of the contract for the exchange was incompatible with the requirements because the procedure for the award of the initial contract was completed and the negotiated procedure for the purpose of establishing the terms of the contract, which was to apply until the conclusion of the new open procedure, was not carried out.
No payments related to this replacement order were made in 2017.
3.30.11.
The Staff Regulations provide that, in the case of an external selection procedure, temporary staff shall only be engaged in grades SC 1 to SC 2, AST 1 to AST 4 or AD 5 to AD 8 (234).
In 2017, the Agency employed two employees (2016: 14) in the higher grades AST.

In 2017, the Isl.Wachty Isl. Isl. isl. was providing financial support for flights to Greece.
Before the reimbursement of the expenditure declared by Iceland, the Agency requested invoices as proof of the category of expenditure declared.
Although the accounts have never been presented, the Agency has reimbursed around EUR 440 000.
In this case, the ex ante analysis was therefore ineffective.
3.30.13.
The Agency also co-financed the use of the aircraft used by the Spanish Guardia Civil.
In the absence of documents on the costs declared in the audit and maintenance of the Agency, the Agency reimbursed EUR 430 000 on the basis of the average costs per hour of flight.
These average costs were calculated on the basis of the costs ceilings applied in the Vertr to Spanish employees and private contractors in the framework of inspections and maintenance.
There is a risk that costs are higher than those actually incurred.
3.30.14.
Although the Agency has already taken back its current measures in 2014, it still has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan approved by the Management Board.
COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.30.15
The Agency has again cancelled the significant appropriations allocated from the previous financial year for the reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by the participating countries in the joint actions, i.e. EUR 7,7 million and 16,5 % (2016: EUR 5,6 million and 17,6 %).
This shows that the co-operating countries have again significantly overestimated the expenditure to be reimbursed by the Agency.
Although the joint actions had to be cancelled in the next two years, in 2017, the Agency had to contribute EUR 9.6 million from other budget lines to joint actions and, as a result, again contributed EUR 40.5 million to the next financial year.
The Joint Actions represent 69% of total cancelled appropriations (EUR 11,1 million) in 2017 and 46% of total appropriations for 2018 (EUR 87,6 million).
3.30.16.
In 2017, 66.5 million euro was allocated to relocation activities, but less action was taken than to relocation activities.
The Agency therefore paid EUR 13.5 million and EUR 20.3% (EUR 23 million in 2016 and EUR 37.5% in 2016 respectively).
In addition, the Agency paid EUR 4 million from the budget in Title I of the budget (staff expenditure) because in 2017 it was not able to employ as many new workers as was planned.
3.30.17.
The Agency's initial budget for 2017 includes EUR 8.8 million for EUR 8.8 million for EUR 8.8 million to cover operational expenditure to cover expenditure on expenditure to cover expenditure to cover expenditure on border security expenditure and to cover expenditure on recruitment (235).
In September and October 2017, the Agency again paid EUR 1.9 million (total EUR 3.8 million) from the R.C. action to its operational budget to finance other activities.
3.30.18.
After the execution of the revenue from other budget items and after the establishment of the amending budget, the funds from the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the application for the action for the action for the action for application for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for the action for
However, the Agency used, in principle, R's application, R's application used to finance standard operations (€8.4 million) and to finance a project of remotely controlled aviation surveillance (Drones, €7 million) from which it valued only €1.1 million.

Under the instrument for financial support for external borders and visas, the Commission shall reimburse Member States for the costs of purchasing equipment such as vehicles or ships and operating costs such as fuel or maintenance costs.
The Agency shall also reimburse such costs to participants in joint actions.
Therefore, there is a risk of double financing [4] which is not taken into account.
In the case of the participating countries, these costs include costs of ăfixcosts (depreciation and maintenance costs), ă variable costs (fuel costs) and ă operating costs (general costs) (general costs and other crew costs).
The reported costs are based on actual values and are consistent with national standards and costs vary in the participating countries, which means that all stakeholders have a particularly burdensome system.
In Special Report No 12/2016, the Court recommended that the agencies use simplified cost options, where possible, in order to avoid such inefficiencies [5].
The Agency's discharge Regulation in force until 5 October 2016 provides for the financing of joint financing actions for joint financing actions with participating countries.
However, between January and October 2016, the Agency financed national reverse operations of EUR 3.6 million of EUR 3.6 million.
These payments are not in accordance with the requirements.
The Staff Regulations provide that in the case of an external selection procedure, temporary staff shall only be engaged in grades SC 1 to SC 2, AST 1 to AST 4 or AD 5 to AD 8 (6).
In 2016, the Agency employed 14 employees at the upper grades AST.
In Title II (administrative expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) in Title III (operational expenditure) in Title II (administrative expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) in Title 6.4 million EUR (operational expenditure) and Title 6.4 million EUR (operational expenditure) and Title 37% (operational expenditure) in Title III (operational expenditure) in Title III (operational expenditure) in the following financial year (EUR 40,2 million and 35% respectively).
The Agency may decide to introduce separate budgetary measures to better address misunderstandings which are inevitably created between legal obligations, commitments, commitments and commitments and payments.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/179 PL Court's observations The cancellation rate of 2015 amounts to EUR 6.4 million and 16% respectively in Title III (operational expenditure) and Title III (operational expenditure) as the costs in 2015 which had to be reimbursed in 2016 were too high.
The extended mandate of the Agency for relocation activities recognises relocation activities and the 2016-2016 budget allocates EUR 63 million to relocation activities.
However, EUR 23 million and 37.5% of this amount were paid back to the EU budget, as it was less financed than expected.
The significant dispersion of the framework contract procurement procedure of EUR 50 million for aircraft charter and related services to Frontex-Reck has contributed to this situation and continues to have a negative impact on the number of operations directed by the Agency.
On 4 April 2016, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2016/1499 [2] appointing the members and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions for the period from 26 April 2016 to 25 April 2020.
On 22 December 2015, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2015/1333.
However, cooperation agreements with three partners (legal obligation) worth EUR 3.4 million were only signed between August and November 2016.
In the case of two of these financial commitments, the fuck the fucking fucking hell they fucking fucking hell they fucking do!
In addition, commitments amounted to EUR 1.2 million and only included pre-financing.
This approach is in breach of the provisions of the Financial Regulation on the financing of the budget, and, in addition, it concluded agreements on the uncertainty of operational cooperation between the partners.
The Agency's 2016 establishment plan provides for 275 posts for officials and temporary staff (8). At the end of 2016 only 197 and 71% of posts were employed, mainly because 50 new posts were only created in October 2016 and the employment had to be completed.
The Agency regularly employs staff with the required profiles for difficulties, partly linked to the adjustment rate for staff who have applied to staff (66.7 %). Year 2016 Year-to-year status (closed/closed/occupied/out/out/out/out/out/out/out/out/out)
C 434/180 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN Court's observations Following the extension of its mandate, the number of Agency staff will reach more than twice more than 1,000 in 2016 from 365 to 1,000 in 2020[9].
This increase was not based on a solid demand.
The Agency, together with the Commission and the host country, is currently examining how this need can be met.

DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/181 ANSWERS OF THE AGENCY COMMENTS ON THE JUSTICE AND JUSTICE OF INTRODUCTION 3.30.10.
Following the decision by Frontex to terminate the agreement, the continuity of the services had to be ensured until the new contractor had been selected.
Given the limited market for services in the region (lowest number of economic operators) it was considered the most appropriate termination of the service contract with the company which separated the second best supplier from the second best supplier during the initial invitation to tender for the selection of reed ships.
In this case, it is not, therefore, a continuation of the tender procedure already completed.
The Agency has already recognised that the customer has experience in the provision of services to the customer customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of services in the services of services of services of the services of the services of the services of services of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the services of the customer of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the services of the services of the services of the customer of the customer of the customer of the services
The contractor explained that he was willing to provide services under the same conditions as was required and offered in the original invitation to tender.
In November 2017, a derogation was signed in which the rank of the decision was signed.
The Partnership Agreement was signed by both parties in December 2017 and entered into force in January 2018.
The use of the price as the only criterion has been carefully checked and has been based on the experience of Frontex over the last two years in the procurement of public procurement services between the Greek islands and the T islands for two years.
Due to market constraints in the geographical region, the lowest number of operators with limited supply of F on the market was not intended to create qualitative award criteria.
The services that Frontex has adopted are short journeys between the Greek islands and the islands of Terkei, which were intended to travel back to the island, under the agreement on the adoption of the agreement between the EU and Terkkei, in order to ensure that these activities were carried out in a safe environment and in full respect of fundamental rights.

This decision was fully in line with the workplace (which form part of the budget) and was never questioned by officials.
Since March 2017, Frontex has not engaged external candidates in higher grades than AST 4.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.30.12.
The costs of inspections/maintenance are defined as the costs of inspections/maintenance throughout the lifetime of the measure (...).
The rate based on the data provided by the manufacturer or by the maintenance centre of the undertaking benefiting from the measure.
This means that the hourly rate may be expressed in the form of an explanation of the costs, depending on the costs incurred by the beneficiaries, depending on the costs incurred by the producer or on the price determined on the basis of the actual costs incurred in previous years or on the basis of the costs, based on the reference data on the costs incurred in previous years, in the case of the new measures in question where the data are not available.
Invoices (or equivalent accounting documents) may be provided only if the hourly price is based on the costs actually incurred in the reference year.
However, in the absence of invoices, where the data subject is unable to set an hourly rate based on the average reference prices, the data subject is able to set an hourly rate.
This was the case with the selected payment, while Isl watch FRONTEX in Isl Isl worked together on the costs of maintenance work.
The documentation submitted by Isl Wachta Isljanska takes into account the results of the ex post controls carried out by the Frontex ex post control team in 2015 during the visit to the HQ in Iceland, the team introduced the documents submitted by Isl. Wachta Isl. Wachta.
Therefore, according to the opinion of the Frontex agency, the document submitted by Iceland constitutes sufficient reason to approve the issue.

Guardia Civil calculates Frontex, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the hourly rate for the maintenance of the engine.
If less time is spent on maintenance of engines, the total limit will not be reached.
Therefore, the hourly rate does not apply in this case to the total value of the contract.

The Agency assumes that, after the termination of the contract, Guardia Civil will pay the total amount specified in the contract.
The Agency cannot participate in the Court's risk assessment because it was sent back by Guardia Civila, who, on the basis of the contract on the basis of the contract on the basis of the total price, ultimately belonged to the persons who received a refund on the basis of specific invoices.
The current approach to farm management, the current strategy and the resulting emergency areas have been developed and updated on the basis of the legal framework and structure that were in force until the end of 2016.

COMMENTS ON BUDGET 3.30.15
This challenge is linked to the possibility to make up for commitments in a given year.
In order to avoid the risk of the cancellation of Frontex in the fourth quarter of 2016, Frontex asked the interested parties to ask them in the first half of 2016 to pay in the first half of 2016, and Frontex in the first half of 2016 to provide in the first half of 2016 the cost of current revenue (December 2016) or planned revenue (January 2017) in the framework of operational tasks in 2016.
The main objective of these calls was to identify possible reservations, to reduce the relevant SFD allocations and to re-use these funds in 2016.
Despite some positive results, the financial resources were still very high.
Therefore, despite the correct solution to the real financial needs, Frontex has implemented additional measures to ensure that, in the autumn of 2016, these measures will be covered, as the measures that have been abolished and have already been abolished have not been used at that time.
The Agency has developed a simplified management scheme, which will be implemented within the operational cycle 2018, within which fixed costs will be used to a much higher extent in the case of an increase of up to one year; the Agency will not only step up the monitoring of the execution of payments, but will also seek to reduce the cancellation of payments.

In 2017, the number of measures to deal with the coordination of Frontex increased significantly: the number of migrants increased from 10 700 in 2016 to 14 200 in 2017, compared with 47% in the previous year.
This represents 10% of the total number of migrants from the EU from third countries (in 2014 this figure amounted to 2%).
Recruitment The staff expenditure payments were essentially linked to difficulties and difficulties in the recruitment process in this connection: long-term procedures, long-term recruitment dates, insufficient number of candidates and geographical imbalances due to the low correction factor.
Nevertheless, the Agency considers it a success to employ and employ 250 new workers within one year.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/183 3.30.17.
In 2017, the Agency was the first year of implementation of the new ETUC Regulation.
In accordance with Article 75 (13), the Agency is required in its budget to finance immediate security operations (RABIT) and security operations (RABIT) amounting to 4 % of the appropriations provided for in the operation.
On 1 October each year, at least one quarter of the complaint R On 1 October each year should remain in force in order to meet the needs arising by the end of the year.
An operational call was made so that the Agency could at any time within a year on a certain reserve to cover the costs of rapid border intervention and to cover the most significant costs of such rapid border intervention.
The European Parliament amended the original text of the ETUC Regulation proposed by the Commission to add that on 1 October only one quarter of the RUC complaint must remain in force for the remaining three months of the year.
The ECCT Regulation is silent about what is to happen to the remaining three-quarters of R-laws on 1 October, which is unclear.
The first objective at the end of September was to finance the organised operational activities in the air and at sea and to purchase its own air protection services; the second was after 1 October.
The Management Board has been informed in its monthly income report.
The Agency considers that the legislator should ensure transparency with regard to financial matters.
The defendant has already been sued in preparation for the Single Programming Document (EPPD) 2017-2019.
In accordance with Article 75 (3) (3) of the EPKW Regulation, the preparation of the EPPD and of the revenue and expenditure, and the autumn autumn of the year N-1, were started in year N-2, in accordance with Article 75 (3) of the EPKW Regulation.
The EMC Regulation entered into force in October 2016.
The Agency had to plan its annual work programme for 2017 (in the framework of EPPD 2017-2019) throughout 2016, without the final outcome of the work on the ETUC Regulation and thus without a clear legal basis.
At the end of 2016, the EPPD 2017-2019 was already completed and approved by the Administrative Board, which fully supported the creation of an irregular complaint by R.C. in connection with the transition to the European Border Guard and Border Guard.
In its opinion on EPPD 2017-2019 (C91/20168722), in point 63: ăThe Commission indicated that the contingency plan became a fundamental principle for the preparation of the annual work programme and that the Agency intends to provide almost 10% of its operational budget for the so-called operational flexibility............
In this context, the Commission calls on the Agency to establish two separate actions for compensation under its budget, the first being fully in line with Article 75 (13) of the ETUC Regulation, and the second gives the Agency the opportunity to maintain operational flexibility to deal with crisis situations that are not immediate crisis situations, this is not a situation in which the situation is fully in line with Article 75 (13) of the ETUC Regulation and the second gives the Agency the opportunity to maintain operational flexibility in order to deal with crisis situations....
As the Agency publishes offers in English, EPSO requires translation into all the official EU languages, in view of the large number of job offers, it would mean that labour costs have increased significantly and that the procedure for taking the position could be increased.
Frontex disseminates information on job vacancies on other cans, i.e. networks of EU agencies, management, permanent representation, Eurobruce and social media.
Once the agreement is signed with the Commission (DG DIGIT), the instrument will be used for the first time.
The formal deadline for this instrument was set at the end of October 2018 by Article 90 (2) of the Public Procurement Directive, which the Commission applies to the Agency, and Frontex will comply with that deadline.

INTERNAL INTERNAL SERVICE REPORTS 3.31.8.
In 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service presented a report assessing progress in the field of VET in the Turin Process at the Foundation. (243) The Foundation developed an action plan to take corrective action in areas where there is a likelihood that there is a need for improvement.
The annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.
(243) The Court has not examined this work.
C 434/186 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations of previous years An external evaluation of the Foundation was carried out in 2016 on behalf of the Commission.
This was the first step towards a cross-cutting evaluation of the four agencies which are able to do so in the fields of employment, social affairs and social inclusion[1).
The evaluators concluded that the significant restructuring of the Foundation had not had a significant negative impact since 2011 and that its internal and external stakeholders, in particular with regard to its strategy and effectiveness, most of them had a positive assessment.
The Foundation's governance structure has been considered effective and effective.
The evaluation also underlined that the Foundation has continued to improve its security positions since 2011, but that it needs to present its achievements and achievements even more clearly.
The harmonisation and simplification of indicators within a single intervention logic and the use of common terminology throughout the Foundation would contribute to improvement.
The Foundation has developed a plan for implementing the evaluation recommendations.
The Court has already stressed in the Foundation's 2011 accounts that the situation in which the Foundation is satisfactory is unsatisfactory and that the Foundation is unable to continue its experience.
The situation has not changed since, in 2011, as a result of the management of the gebu-decomplexi complex, the consortium, which used part of the year in the complex itself, was wound up and in 2011 the relevant R was completely wound up.
The Member State in which the foundation is established must urgently find a solution to this problem.
The Headquarters Agreement guarantees appropriate rationalisation by 2027.
2016 Status of corrective work (completed/completed/completed/completed/n.a.) n.a. 2016 (1) Other agencies to be assessed are the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Dublin), the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao) and the European Centre for Vocational Training (Thessalonics).

COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.33.8.
In 2017, procurement and grant procedures were not adequately documented.
In the case of service contracts in the form of low and medium value contracts in published procurement documents, in the absence of documentation to calculate the initial selection of candidates in the case of low value contracts, the Authority has not drawn up assessment reports in respect of low value procurement procedures and has not drawn up assessment reports in respect of the procedures for the award of fixed-term service contracts.
Furthermore, the award criteria have not been clearly defined.
As regards the award of grants, risk assessments were inappropriate and the expert reports were not signed.

On 31 December 2015, the number of persons available within 90 days (generally during the year) was 240 766 (in the year) Eu-ro ((1).
The Authority has not used all the possibilities provided for in its Financial Regulation to recover the outstanding appropriations, such as execution (2), EUR 788 540 and 40% (EUR 395 882 and 28% respectively) in Title II (administrative expenditure) of EUR 395 882 respectively and in Title II (administrative expenditure) in the following financial year.
This appropriation is intended mainly to cover ongoing renovations of buildings (EUR 284 423), IT projects (EUR 253 483), and costs of work and evaluations (EUR 137 098), partly provided in 2017 or invoiced only this year.
Title II, which amounted to 17% (2015: 20%), also noted a high percentage of cancelled payment appropriations of 2015, indicating the need to improve budgetary planning.
Periodic external evaluations are not required by the Authority's exemption regulation.
Although the Authority or the Commission has carried out ad hoc assessments of specific issues, the Authority, together with the Commission, should have an external evaluation carried out, at least every five years, as have most other agencies.

When checking the price offers of economic operators, the Authority shall verify that unit prices are correctly applied.
3.34.10.
However, for the framework agreement procedure of EUR 80 million for general advisory, advisory and project management services, as well as for research, the list of services to be provided under the framework agreement has not been drawn up.
As regards the evaluation of tenders, the tender descriptions contained two business scenarios for project management and a programme covering several projects.
The Framework Agreement is a multi-faceted framework agreement, which partly covers the cascade procedure (general advisory services and project management services) and partly the call for competition (practic and research).
The Authority has previously identified the entities and the tenderers have been asked to determine the breakdown between the various profiles.
Therefore, the framework agreement and some of the individual related agreements were announced on the basis of unit prices, types of profiles and quality, but not on the basis of the expected number of units they benefit from, which is another important element in the calculation of the fixed price agreement.
3.34.11.
With regard to this Framework Agreement, an individual fixed price contract of EUR 145 447,50 has been assessed, in particular as regards the provision of support services for the implementation of the document management project.

Therefore, at the fixed price specified in this individual contract, there is a risk that the benefits will not be provided in the most economic manner.
3.34.12.
If all conditions for the provision of services for the provision of a framework contract are not defined, it is more appropriate to re-invite individual candidates to apply for a contract among several contractors of a framework contract.
The annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/197 PL 2016 Correction status (completed/completed/completed/n.a.) (3) ANNEX Follow-up action in relation to the Court's observations in previous years The implementation rate of the Office's budget of 89% was low, indicating an inaccurate reduction in expenditure in the 2016 budget.
Following the increasing revision of the Block Exemption Regulation and the Financial Regulation of the Authority, it has become increasingly important, if necessary, of the establishment by the Authority of a budget from the amending budget, in view of the fact that, in view of the mechanisms that have been provided for in the budget, such as the allocation of funds from the R claim fund in connection with claims, if necessary, and the related compensatory mechanism (2).
In 2014, the Authority launched a tender for a framework agreement for a period of four years of EUR 30 million for the purchase of advisory services covering a wide range of services, including research services, project management, general advisory services and research.
However, the procurement procedure and the procedure for concluding the framework agreement have not been adequately managed.
The objectives and tasks to be carried out have not been clearly defined in order to allow precise determination of the size of the framework agreement.
Therefore, the measures provided for in the framework agreement were fully exhausted after two years and six months.
Moreover, despite the variety of services to be provided and the very different expenditures, no parts were used.
The use of parts may stimulate smaller companies to participate in low value proceedings.
Finally, the price competition was neutralized and the customer's compliance, because using the framework agreement, asked for a fixed price offer from one customer.
The Authority should seek to conclude agreements with several suppliers and, if necessary, seek competition again.
The Authority's discharge regulation states that the necessary translations are carried out by the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union (CdT), which means that the Office is the Centre's main client.
The Authority is increasingly using internal applications such as language and language memory, translation memory, as well as additional software.
These instruments aim to improve the cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Authority.
However, from the perspective of the European Union, the current situation could double the expenditure and the costs involved.

The Authority shall continue to cooperate with the national control authorities with a view to reducing the cancelled results using mid-term reports on results and half-yearly controls with understood control measures that form an integral part of any new cooperation agreement.
In addition, internal activities, such as training, training, information notes and meetings with financial stakeholders, have been implemented internally.
In addition, before the end of 2017, the Authority expected that the level of cancelled profits would increase by 15% and that it would actively take additional measures to reduce profits for the year C.E.
The Authority takes note of the Court's observations.
It should first be noted that the scenarios described in the public procurement documents for future uses of the contract were intended to achieve the objective of clarity and reliance and not to expect that they would be specifically linked to each specific contract.
As regards the adequacy of the new competitiveness mechanisms and in line with the Authority's response to the 2016 audit, this concept has already been included in the Narrow Framework Agreement on Audits and Research.
The Authority compared the added value of the mechanism with the administrative costs incurred and, in view of the Authority's intensive use of advisory and project management services, concluded that this is not the most efficient way of managing the latter services.
Note that the current Framework Agreement for 2020 has the power to extend this mechanism to consultancy services and project management services would require a new call for proposals at this stage, which the Authority considers inappropriate.
In the existing cascade system, the Authority shall once again respond to the 2016 audit for the purposes of the application of fixed pricing procedures.
The main reason for this option is that proceedings against the Office before the Spanish labour courts for the transfer of workers that are not justified is, inter alia, related to the use of the ăTime and Means system.
In the case of a fixed price procedure (under the cascade system), the Authority shall have experience in the evaluation of tenders.
EUIPO has established a dedicated team which, on the basis of previous practice and expertise, is able to determine what resources are needed to carry out the tasks which are necessary to carry out tasks which are outside fixed price services.
However, we believe that the Court's doubts can be resolved by other contractual methods than the fixed price, e.g. by the procedure ăquoted Time and Means... which can in the future be dealt with by the Office in individual cases.
The Authority undertakes to provide further information and to document its own resources necessary for the performance of fixed price service tasks prior to the submission of a request for a tender in order to provide evidence of the above mentioned experience of the Authority prior to the submission of a request for a tender.

The Committee is responsible for managing the Single Resolution Fund (hereinafter referred to as "the ăder Fund') established by the SRM Regulation to support the Single Resolution Mechanism.

Emphasis on the facts of 3.35.9.
Without questioning its judgments in paragraphs 3.35.6 to 3.35.8, the Court would stress that the fund's costs are calculated on the basis of the information provided to the Committee by credit institutions (and certain investment firms).
The Court accepted this information in determining the Committee's revenue but did not agree with this information.
The SRM Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework that ensures that information is available.
Furthermore, the Committee cannot disclose the details of the contributions of each credit institution calculated on the basis of a risk assessment, since the calculations are limited and confidential information includes information on other credit institutions.

Administrative complaints or legal proceedings between credit institutions and national resolution authorities and the Committee for the Supervision of the Fund and the Court of Justice of the European Union Complaints brought by former shareholders and choirs of Banco Popular Espa.ol, S.A., after the adoption of the resolution concept, former shareholders and choirs of S.A., former members and members of Banco Popular Espa.ol.
For additional information, see point 8 of the Committee's accounts.
3.35.11.
The following comments do not call into question the Court's opinion.
The Committee has not ensured that payments are made within the time limit set.
Around 28% of payments (95% of total payments) to contractors and reimbursement of costs to experts and employees were made on a total basis.
COMMENTS ON ACCOUNTABILITY 3.35.13.
Article 92 (4) of the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation provides, in particular, a report on the conditional liabilities arising from the exercise by the Committee, the Council and the Commission of the obligations arising from this Regulation.
In accordance with the procurement plan in the Annex to the 2017 Work Programme, 16 different services were to be granted to the 2017 Work Programme, but in practice only in the field of legal advice.
In addition, the value of the contract was set out in the public procurement plan of EUR 3 million, while the value of the contract of EUR 29 million.
This indicates unnecessary shopping planning.
3.35.15.
Of the candidates for legal aid of EUR 29 million, EUR 20 million was awarded through eleven negotiated procedures without prior publication.
In addition, two amounts of EUR 3 million were also allocated under this procedure for economic and financial evaluation advice and support (as foreseen in the 2016 annual work programme).
The application of such procedures is aimed at limiting competition.
DE 30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/201 3.35.16.
The Committee should establish uniform financial rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (263).
Given that the same applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing all IT, which covers all phases of public procurement. The Commission has launched electronic invoicing tools (2010), the electronic publication of procurement notices (2011) and the electronic submission of tenders (2015). The Committee has not yet launched any of these tools by the end of 2017.
3.35.17.
The Committee publishes employment notices on its own website and on social media, but in most cases not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). In this way, the principles of transparency, publication and transparency are respected, and citizens who have not been able to read the employment notices in the various European institutions and agencies.
The Annex provides an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the Court's observations in previous years.

C 434/202 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 EN ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations in previous years The Committee decided in 2015.
However, a number of key procedures and controls, including risk management and control strategies, internal control standards, a regular assessment of the proper functioning of the internal control system and anti-fraud strategies, are still expected to be developed, adopted or implemented.
The Court of Auditors has not yet approved the Committee's invoicing system.
Only 62% (in 2015: 67%) and EUR 35 million (in 2015: EUR 15 million) were paid out of the available funds (1).
The appropriations allocated for the following financial year are EUR 3.1 million and 35% (EUR 3.3 million and 70% respectively) for Title II (administrative expenditure).
These are essentially IT services provided in 2016 (EUR 1.9 million) and security services provided this year, which have not yet been charged and paid (EUR 0.6 million).
The appropriations allocated for the following financial year in Title III of the budget (operational expenditure) amount to EUR 5.3 million and 66% (EUR 1.6 million and 40% respectively in 2015) of the appropriations respectively.
This mainly concerns services provided by the European Central Bank (€1.9 million), legal services (€1.5 million) and IT services (€1.3 million) to be provided in 2017.
Between July and October 2016, the Committee committed to the purchase of legal services of EUR 2 million. These services were not foreseen in the annual work programme, nor in the budget, nor was the financing decision adopted before the corresponding budget commitment was made.
In 2016, the European Central Bank paid EUR 24 million of negative interest (2) to the national central banks.

The contributions collected in advance in favour of the Fund shall be calculated on the basis of the information provided to the Committee of credit institutions and to certain investment firms.
Although the SRM Regulation does not provide for a comprehensive and uniform control framework to ensure the compatibility of this information, the SRF devotes all possible attention to this aspect.
The data shall be reported on the basis of the data provided by the institutions in the previous year and the data contained in the ECB's database.
The differences are displayed to the national resolution authorities which are asked to clarify the facts, which allowed the SRF to improve the quality of the data in previous cycles.
Furthermore, the Committee cannot disclose the details of the previously collected contributions to the institution, calculated on the basis of a risk assessment, since the calculations are limited and thus disclose confidential information on other institutions.
However, the SRF revealed the method of calculation and detailed calibrations to ensure transparency and cooperation.
3.35.12.
In 2017, the financial team was unable to find experienced employees, thanks to the combination of unexpectedly high workload, unfortunate fluctuations of employees in the financial team and general difficulties in finding experienced employees.
Since the 4th quarter of 2017, the team has been reconstructed and measures have been taken to ensure timely processing of invoices.
So far, almost 98% of invoices have been paid in 2018.
Any delay in payments is currently being examined in detail in order to further improve in this area.
3.35.14.
In 2016, the SRB's initial procurement plan was adopted in 2017, when it was adopted only in the second, most complete year of the SRB's existence in 2017.
At that time, no remedial proceedings had been carried out, and the Agency had little experience on the basis of which a public procurement plan could be drawn up.
As a new agency, the SRB could benefit from the various interinstitutional frameworks managed by the European Commission.
Given the fact that the following procurement procedures, which should be launched by the SRB in 2017, have not been properly taken over.
In 2018, the implementation of the procurement plan will be closely monitored and additional efforts will be made to improve the planning of procurement procedures.
In 2017, SRB used in H.H.H.H. a total of EUR 20 million to provide legal advice services.
Almost all negotiated procedures without prior publication of the contract notice concerned legal disputes (eight out of ten speeches of a total value of EUR 10,9 million) which did not fall within the scope of Directive 2014/24/EU.
This also includes a large number of disputes which have been brought before the Court of Justice following the first SRB resolution procedure.
Therefore, the SRB does not consider that it applies such procedures in a non-discriminatory manner.
As regards the tender for the economic and financial evaluation of two of the WZs in 2017, the re-launch of the competition proved ineffective and the SRB had therefore to force it to take part in the negotiation procedures.
Due to the subject-matter of the contract and the need for the most secret confidentiality, the contract award notice has not been published in accordance with the applicable rules.
3.35.16.
On-line access to tender documents is available to traders on the SRB website since the publication of the call for tenders and has been fully integrated into the e-procurement platform since the end of 2017.
In June 2017, the SRB requested to use the possibility to submit tenders electronically, but the Commission has not yet provided access.
The SRB noted that such publications on EPSO's website do not concern either the quality or the number of applications and are very expensive due to the required translation of the notice of employment.
The SRB therefore publishes its notices of employment on its own website and on the EU_CV online and LinkedIn website and informs its stakeholders (central banks, finance ministries, national agencies, other EU agencies and permanent representations).

The Centre's task is to provide translation services to EU agencies and bodies for which this service is for European Union agencies and bodies, and this is a task for EU institutions which can use the Centre's services.
The implementing regulations of most agencies and bodies provide for the use of the Centre's translation services.
Some agencies and agencies (from which more than half of the Centre's revenues) are increasingly taking advantage of internal opportunities and other opportunities.
However, this means that the Centre's resources are not used to the fullest extent, that there is a trick in terms of the development of systems and running costs at European level, and that the business model and maintenance of the Centre can be justified.
In 2017, an external assessment of the adequacy of the Centre's business model was carried out.
The final evaluation report was not yet adopted at the time of the Court's evaluation (268).

COMMENTS ON THE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF THE ACCOUNT 3.36.9.
In accordance with their Financial Framework Regulation, agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (269) (270).
As this requirement also applies to the EU institutions, the Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT version covering all stages of public procurement, launching electronic invoicing tools (2010), electronic publication of procurement documents in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
By the end of 2017, the Centre launched some electronic invoicing procedures but did not launch an electronic invitation to tender and tender.
The Annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken on the basis of the Court's observations of the previous years.

This disagreement is due to the fact that it is appointed by the Management Board and that its position is permanent.
In order to ensure the independence of the accounting officer, from 2018 onwards, he will be directly subject to the accounting role of the Centre's Director and will be evaluated by the Director.

COMMENTS ON THE ADAPTATION OF THE ADAPTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS 3.38.8.
As part of the work on these EU agencies, the Court has analysed accounting, including the hierarchical position and the unburdened accounting, and in the context of the timely (new) approval of invoicing systems.
The Director of the Financial Department of the Agency shall be the Head of the Financial Department.
The Court therefore considers that it is necessary for the Court to clarify that the Court is irrecoverable by direct submission to the Director (administrative matters) and the Steering Committee (functional matters) of the Agency.
3.88.9.
In addition, the mandate of the Agency was significantly extended in 2014: it currently manages the EU's activities in various fields in cooperation with the seven Commission DGs.
Despite significant changes in the Agency's procedures and a significant increase in its budget and staff, the invoicing system was revalidated in 2012.
In accordance with the Financial Regulation, executive agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic exchange of data with third parties involved in procurement procedures (282). Since the rules for EU institutions and agencies also apply to this purpose, the Commission is currently developing the whole IT covering all stages of the procurement procedure, including the tools for electronic invoicing (2010), the electronic publication of documents in procurement notices in the Official Journal of the EU (2011) and the submission of tenders in electronic form (2015).
REPORTS FROM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICE 3.38.11.
In 2017, the Commission's internal audit services submitted reports on the implementation of the COSME programme (Competitiveness programme for enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises) by the Agency and the administrative procedures of the Agency's staff department[283].
The Agency has developed action programmes to take corrective action in areas where there is a risk that there is a need for improvement.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/215 PL ANNEX Follow-up action in relation to the Court's observations in previous years The commitment rate in the following financial year was high in both Title II (administrative expenditure) of EUR 1 250 000 and 33% (in 2015 respectively: EUR 998 324 and 14%) and in Title III (the Agency's operating aid) of EUR 2 550 000 and 62% (in 2015 respectively: EUR 4 million and 65%).
Title II mainly concerned rent (EUR 0.6 million) and the purchase of equipment which had not yet been delivered at the end of the year (EUR 0.5 million).
The appropriations under Title III concerned the evaluation and monitoring of the LIFE programme by external experts (EUR 1,5 million), the ongoing ex post audits (EUR 0,5 million) and the IT services (EUR 0,5 million) which were commissioned in 2016, but were partly carried out at the end of the year and have not yet been calculated.
The Agency may decide to introduce separate budgetary measures in order to better take account of the multi-annual nature of the responsibility and the unavoidable discrepancies between contracts, supplies and payments.
The high cancellation rate of the previous year under Title I (personal expenditure) of EUR 32000 and EUR 8,3% indicates that the appropriations were too high.

The Agency considers that its internal control system provides sufficient assurance as to the effective division of responsibilities and the independence of the accounting officer.
The Court of Auditors has been appointed by the Steering Board.
The Steering Committee shall adopt the initial and final invoices, the administrative budget and any other amendments.
The Director shall approve the main services to be performed and to be provided by the auditor.
The Agency considers that the change in the current reporting structure and organisation would not have a significant impact on the risk and the control of financial reporting.
However, the Agency will closely monitor the situation and, if necessary, adapt the organisational requirements and reporting requirements.
3.38.9. The Invoicing Team started approving the invoicing systems in December 2017 and concluded the invoicing systems in 2018.
3.38.10.
In the field of procurement, the Agency has ordered electronic invoicing from some IT service providers since 2013, including complete electronic processing and an automated interface to ABAC data flow.
Since 2018, electronic invoicing will continue to be developed and gradually applied to other suppliers, depending on their infrastructure and electronic equipment.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/219 PL ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations in previous years The reports on tenders and evaluations drawn up by the Procurement Committee and the Agency's Employment Committee do not provide a complete and practical picture of the procedures used.
Unsatisfactory reports affect the transparency of these procedures.
In its September 2016 review report, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the Agency has undertaken a number of strategic and operational actions to improve the recruitment, engagement and allocation of staff.
In this context, the IAS concluded that the Agency has developed and implemented appropriate human resources management that would enable it to use competent and committed personnel to achieve its objectives.
Although no critical or particularly serious problems were identified, the Agency and the IAS agreed on an action plan to further improve this procedure in certain areas.
Under Title III (operational expenditure), the commitment rate (EUR 1.3 million in 2015 and EUR 43 million in 2015 respectively) was still high, as was generally the result of the external and communication activities that were undertaken in the course of the year.
The high performance ratio is contrary to the principle of budgetary fairness.
Year 2016 2016 Date of adjustment (completed/in progress/in anticipation/n.d.)
DE C 434/220 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 of the AGENCY's replies 3.39.8. Currently, electronic submission of tenders is limited to open procedures (the thresholds are set out in Directive 2014/25/EU on public procurement and amounted to EUR 135 000 in 2017).
As the Agency did not launch such a procedure in 2017, it will not be able to launch the electronic submission of tenders in 2017.
In addition, the use of electronic offers will become mandatory in line with the Commission's action plan at the end of 2018 by the EU institutions and agencies.
Therefore, the start-up process started in 2018 and the Agency will be able to use electronic offers before the end of the year.
In the case of negotiated procedures, the Agency will use electronic submission of tenders after inclusion of this option in the module by the Commission.
3.39.9.
In accordance with the Action Plan drawn up by the Agency and approved by the IAS with regard to the preparation of FP7 projects on 9.4.2018, the ERCEA has implemented its activities.

The following comments do not undermine the Court's view.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.41.8
The selection process of contract staff shows weaknesses.
Recruitment records and minutes of the recruitment committee meetings do not always include criteria used to select candidates from the recruitment database (304).
In accordance with the Financial Regulation, executive agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (305).
As this applies to EU institutions and agencies, the Commission is currently developing a comprehensive IT version covering all stages of public procurement procedures, launching electronic invoicing tools (2010), electronic publication of procurement notices (2011) and electronic submission of tenders (2015).
REPORTS FROM INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICE 3.410.
In May 2017, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) presented a report on the implementation of FP7 projects under the REA (306).
The Agency has developed an action plan to take corrective action in areas where there is a risk that there is a need for improvement.
The Annex gives an overview of the corrective actions taken on the basis of the Court's observations of previous years.
(304) In addition, reference is made to the 2016 management report of the Agency's staff submitted by the Commission's internal audit services.

30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/227 PL ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations of previous years In its evaluation report of December 2016, the Commission's Internal Audit Service (IAS) concluded that the overall management of the Agency's staff is appropriate.
The Agency and IAS have agreed on a corrective action plan with regard to the findings of the report.
In its other May 2016 evaluation report, the IAS concluded that the Agency, together with the Commission, established an effective internal control system for the management of grants under Horizon 2020.
The Agency and the IAS have jointly agreed with the Commission on a corrective action plan with regard to a finding which is considered to be very important.
For the Commission, the Agency's results have been assessed externally in 2012-2015, which was presented in the final report in May 2016.
The evaluation concluded that the Agency carried out its tasks in an efficient, efficient and costly manner during the period in question, and that its tasks and the Commission's recommendations are still relevant in the most efficient, efficient and costly manner and that the Commission's operational tasks for the Agency have been successful.
However, the evaluators have also contributed to an even more effective and efficient skills development. The Agency and the Commission have been asked to improve internal dialogue and cooperation, communication and certain aspects of IT and human resources management.
The Agency and the Commission have agreed on a corrective action plan.

In 2016, a recruitment process was conducted in which deficiencies were identified and in 2016 a reserve list was prepared and adopted which was used in 2017 to present a job offer.
In 2017, the selection procedure for REA f.A. contract staff was reviewed and extended in accordance with IAS 2016 Recommendation.
As a result of the review of the contract staff contest for contract staff for the purpose of clearly documented search criteria for life and life and for evaluation for the evaluation of recruitment and selection criteria for contract staff.
The search criteria used by the selection authorities shall be documented in their logs.
Consequently, the shortcomings in the process referred to by the Court have already been addressed.
In the field of procurement, the REA shall be based on service contracts with the Commission or on Commission framework agreements.

In 2017, REA carried out only one low-value award procedure.
The current tools for the electronic invitation to tender and the electronic submission of tenders are only applicable for public contracts above the threshold of EUR 144 000. Since the REA has not yet launched a procurement procedure above this threshold, it has not been able to use the tools for the electronic invitation to tender and the electronic submission of tenders in 2017.
In addition, the introduction of an electronic call for tenders and the electronic submission of tenders is mandatory by the end of 2018 and therefore the implementation process only started in 2018, in line with the Commission's action plan for all EU institutions and agencies.
The Agency shall already use electronic invoicing and, after the start of the tendering procedure, shall also use the modules of the electronic invitation to tender and the electronic submission of tenders as soon as the modules are also covered by the mid- and low-value modules.

The Agency shall be established in Luxembourg and its mandate shall be lost until 31 December 2024.
The Agency shall implement the Community Health Action Programme, the Consumer Programme and the Better Training for Safer Food and Safer Food Initiatives.

Payments Judgment on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the annual accounts 3.42.6.
Emphasising facts 3.42.7.
Since the end of November 2017, the Agency's accounting officer has been absent.
On 13 December 2017, the Council adopted Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council [2] and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council [2] laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers by Member States of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission's exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission by Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
This is contrary to Article 28 of the Agency's financial rules, which provides that the authorising officer and the authorising officer have separate functions and separate competences.
3.42.8.
COMMENTS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS 3.42.9.
In 2017, the Agency did not sufficiently document recruitment procedures.
The grounds for transparency and equal treatment of candidates could thus be questioned.
In 2017, the Agency encountered difficulties in obtaining a sufficient number of tenderers in low and medium-value procurement procedures.
She received only one offer for each of these procedures.
3.42.11.
Within the framework of the Financial Regulation, implementing agencies should establish uniform rules for electronic storage and electronic data exchange with third parties involved in procurement procedures (311).
3.42/12
The Agency publishes employment notices for temporary staff on its own website and on social media, but not on the website of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). This makes it transparent and publishes on its website, and allows citizens to familiarize themselves with employment notices in the various European institutions and agencies.
The Agency's budget is weak. Title III of the budget allocates EUR 1.6 million and 63% respectively (in 2016 EUR 1.2 million and 48% of the budget respectively) for... (in 2017) for 2018.
Persecution of comments from the previous years of 3.42.14.
The Annex provides an overview of the corrective actions taken on the basis of the Court's observations of previous years. (311) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, Article 95 (2) of the eGovernment.
30.11.2018 Official Journal of the European Union C 434/231 PL ANNEX Follow-up of the Court's observations in previous years The Agency cancelled EUR 0.2 million and 18% of the appropriations in 2015 (EUR 0.1 million and 14% respectively in 2014), indicating that in its planning.
The Agency has transferred EUR 1.1 million and 48% (EUR 0.9 million and 52% respectively in 2015) of the appropriations allocated to Title III (the expenditure related to the Agency's performance) to the following financial year.
These measures relate primarily to IT services and other research carried out on request but not carried out or completed before the end of the year.
The Agency cancelled EUR 0.2 million and 17% of the 2015 2015 appropriations for 2016, indicating insufficient planning of needs.

DE C 434/232 Official Journal of the European Union 30.11.2018 the European Commission's replies to the EXPERT AGENCY 3.42.7. The annual accounts have been drawn up and signed by the designated and re-established authorising officer.
3.42.9 The Agency takes note of the Court's observation that the recruitment documents examined by the Court have not been adequately documented.
CHAFEA, however, ensured that no candidate was selected under the selection procedure, since all candidates were treated in the same way.
3.42/10.
For these two low and medium-value candidates referred to in the Financial Regulation, CHAFEA discussed all the actions recommended in the Financial Regulation: the ex ante announcement took place in accordance with the requirements, and, legally, the number of candidates was invited to tender and all candidates gained considerable experience in tenders and services.
In view of the time that the tenderers were gathered for the submission of the tender, CHAFEA applied to the Vademecum DG BUDGET f for public procurement.
CHAFEA is currently testing several IT modules for electronic procurement, including electronic submission of offers.
The first invitation to tender to submit tenders by electronic means will be tested in the third quarter of 2018.
CHAFEA will fully comply with the European Commission Recommendation on the implementation of the electronic tender system by the end of 2018.
CHAFEA agrees that the publication of employment notices for temporary staff on the EPSO website may increase their visibility. 3.42.13.
The Agency accepts the Court's observations.
The Agency will continue to seek to further reduce the C8 withdrawal rate and the end-of-life rate.

EN 10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/7 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 0.1.
The European Court of Auditors shall be the institution responsible for the financial control of the European Union (EU) in accordance with the Treaty.
As an external EU auditor, we contribute to improving the financial management of the EU, while at the same time acting as an independent guardian of the financial interests of EU citizens.
For more detailed information on our work, see the Annual Activity Report, www.eca.europa.eu, and the Special Reports on EU spending and revenue programmes, as well as the opinions on new or revised legislation.
This is our 38th annual report on the implementation of the EU budget, which concerns the financial year 2014.
The annual report on the European Development Funds shall be presented separately.
0.3.
The EU's general budget shall be adopted annually by the Council and the European Parliament.
Our annual report together with the special reports is the basis for the discharge procedure, during which the European Parliament, on the basis of a recommendation from the Council, decides whether the Commission has carried out its tasks with regard to the implementation of the budget to the satisfaction of the Commission.
At the same time, we are forwarding our annual report to the national Parliaments, together with the transmission to the European Parliament and the Council.
0.4.
The main element of our annual report is the statement of the reliability of the consolidated financial statements of the European Union and of the legality and regularity of transactions (hereinafter referred to as "the regularity of transactions") and (hereinafter referred to as "the regularity").
We complete this statement of assurance through detailed assessments of all the main areas of EU activity.
0.5.
The structure of the chapters now reflects the headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and therefore our report is even more important.
The financial framework entered into force in 2014 in order to determine the volume and distribution of EU expenditure in the period up to 2020.
This should make it easier for readers to establish the relationship between the findings in our report and the relevant budgetary and accounting information.
0.6.
There are no separate financial statements for each MFF action and therefore the proposals presented in each evaluation do not constitute an audit opinion.
0.7.
In Chapter 2 we present our findings on budgetary and financial management. In Chapter 3 we present our strategic objectives for improving EU public responsibility. In Chapter 5-9 (MFF 1a, 1b, 2, 4 and 5 tubes) (MFF 1a, 1b, 4 and 5 tubes) (MFF 1a, 1b, 4 and 5 tubes) (MFF 1a, 1b, 4 and 5 tubes) (Rums) (Rums on the regularity of transactions and on the control of selected systems and annual activity reports).
0.8.
The Commission's (or, where appropriate, other EU institutions and bodies' replies) replies to our comments are contained in the report and our findings and conclusions are in line with the replies of the audited entity.
However, as an external auditor, our task is merely to present our findings from the audit, to learn from these findings, and thus to carry out an independent and impartial assessment of the reliability of the accounts and the regularity of the transactions.
(1) How are no detailed assessments of expenditure on actions of the MFF 3 (Security and citizenship) and 6 (non-counting figures?) are presented?
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/9 EN CHAPTER 1 Statement of assurance and related comments Statement of assurance presented by the Court to the European Parliament and to the Council Statement of assurance by the independent auditor The admission of European Union expenditure is an important tool to achieve the policy objectives of the Audit findings for 2014. The financial statements have not revealed any material irregularities regarding the regularity of transactions: Our overall findings of the audit have not changed, but indicate a material level of error There are many forms of corrective action which have a different impact The summary report of the Commission confirms, to a significant extent, the transactions with alleged fraud, which are transmitted to OLAF, points I-XII 1.1-1.3 1.1-1.3 1.4-1.58 1.4-1.8 1.9 1.30-1.44 1.45-1.57 1.59-1.66 of Annex 1.1 of Annex 1.2 of Annex 1.3 of Annex 1 to Annex 1 to Annex 1 to this Regulation.
DE C 373/10 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 to the European Parliament and to the Council Statement of Assurance to the Court of Justice I. For the financial year ending 31 December 2014 and approved by the Commission on 23 July 2015, we conducted a study: (a) the consolidated accounts of the European Union in the form of a consolidated financial report and a consolidated report on the implementation of the budget [2], and (b) the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying that financial report in accordance with Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
Responsibility for the management of II. In accordance with Articles 317 and 318 TFEU and the Financial Regulation, the Commission is responsible for drawing up and submitting the consolidated accounts of the European Union correctly on the basis of recognised international public sector accounting principles and for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
This liability shall include the design, establishment and maintenance of internal control structures necessary for the preparation and presentation of financial statements which are free from material or unintentional misconceptions or.
The Commission is ultimately responsible for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions of the European Union (Article 317 TFEU).
It is our task to present to the European Parliament and the Council, on the basis of our control, the statement of assurance of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
We have conducted our research in accordance with international auditing standards, as well as with IFAC's professional behaviour requirements and international standards for INTOSAI's highest control bodies.
In accordance with these standards, we must respect the requirements of professional behaviour and plan and conduct studies in such a way as to ensure that the consolidated financial statements of the European Union are free from significant bad presentations and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.
IV. The audit shall include the carrying out of audit activities to obtain evidence of the audit of the value and other information contained in the consolidated accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The choice of audit activities shall be the responsibility of the auditor, including the assessment of the risks associated with the material or unintended misrepresentations in the consolidated accounts and in the material or unintended infringements of European Union law in respect of the underlying transactions.
When assessing those risks, the auditor shall take into account all internal controls relevant to the preparation and proper presentation of the consolidated accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions to plan the controls relevant to the circumstances, but not to give an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control system.
The audit shall also include an assessment of the adequacy of the accounting rules applied, the reasonableness of the estimated accounting values, as well as of the total consolidated financial statements.
V. In the area of revenue, as a starting point for our analysis of VAT-based and gross national income-based own resources, we use macroeconomic aggregates that are relevant for their calculation, and we evaluate the data processing systems by the Commission until the Member States receive their contributions and until they are received in the consolidated financial statements.
In the area of traditional own resources, we examine the customs accounts and analyse the flows of customs duties until they are received by the Commission and until the amounts are entered in the accounts.
1. Consolidated financial statements shall include the balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow account, changes in the net asset value and summary of the relevant accounting rules and other explanations (including segmented reporting).
In the area of expenditure, we check the payment transactions after the expenditure has been made, covered and accepted, we check all types of payments, with the exception of advances and advances, after the expenditure has been made, with the exception of payments for the acquisition of assets.
Advances shall be examined if the beneficiary has to provide or provide evidence that they are properly used and the advance is settled or may be recovered.
VII. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and adequate to serve as the basis for our opinions.
Reliability of the accounts The audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts VIII. According to our assessment, the consolidated accounts of the European Union for the year ending 31 December 2014 presents, in all material respects, the financial situation of the Union, the results of its operations and the cash flows, as well as the changes in the net assets for the financial year ending that day, in accordance with the Financial Regulation and the accounting principles based on the international accounting principles of the public sector. Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions Payment Audit opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying revenue IX. According to our assessment, the revenue underlying the accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 is in all material respects legal and regular.
Expenditure incurred in 2014 under the operational budget under headings 1 to 4 of the multiannual financial framework (3) is to a large extent affected by errors.
Our estimated error rate in the payments underlying the accounts is 4.4%.
Our proposal is confirmed by the analysis of the risk levels presented by the Commission in the summary report.
It follows from our assessment that the payments underlying the financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 are to a large extent to blame for the error in the assessment of the reliability and regularity of the payments underlying the financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 as regards the reliability and regularity of the payments referred to in paragraph as regards the lack of assessment of the reliability and regularity of the payments underlying the financial statements.
3. These headings will be discussed in Chapters 5 to 8 of this annual report.

10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/13 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT PRELIMINARY EU expenditure is an important tool for achieving the policy objectives 1.1.
EU spending is an important tool for achieving policy objectives.
Other important instruments are legislation, the free movement of goods, services and capital and the free movement of persons throughout the Union.
EU spending averages 1.9% of total EU spending (see Figure 1.1).
In line with the Treaty, it is our task, inter alia, to assess whether the use of EU budget resources is in line with applicable legislation and other legislation; to assess EU financial statements; to report on savings, efficiency and effectiveness (4) of EU expenditure; to present an opinion on legislative proposals with financial implications.
Our research in support of the Statement of Assurance meets the first and the second of these objectives.
This audit work allows us to identify risks that have a negative impact on economy, cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
It also makes an important contribution to the drafting of an opinion on the proposed financial rules.
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.3.
In this chapter of the Annual Report, we present the basic information on the Statement of Assurance and the review of our audit approach (see Annex 1.1), the audit findings and the audit conclusions; in this chapter we analyse the nature of the various risks related to EU expenditure; to this end, we present the actions taken by the Commission as a result of the Commission's comments and recommendations on the reliability of the financial statements we presented in previous annual reports (see Annex 1.2).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/15 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF COURT OF C 373/15 DE For the financial year 2014 the financial statements did not show any significant false presentation of 1.4.
Our comments concern the consolidated accounts (5) (the annual accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2014).
On 23 July 2015, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2015/1333.
The financial statements are accompanied by a document for the analysis of the financial statements attached to the financial statements Statement Discussion and Analysis ((7), which is not the subject of our opinion.
However, in accordance with the audit principles, we have checked its consistency with the information contained in the financial statements.
1.5.
The annual accounts (see Annex 1.3 extracts) show that as of 31 December 2014 total liabilities amounted to EUR 220.7 billion compared to a total of EUR 162.7 billion.
The 2014 economic result is EUR 11.3 billion (see also paragraphs 2.12 to 2.13).
Our audit showed that the annual accounts did not contain relevant incorrect information (see also Annex 1.2).
Our comments on EU budgetary and financial management are set out in Chapter 2.
5. The consolidated financial statements shall consist of: (a) the consolidated financial statements which shall include the balance sheet (which shall show the assets and liabilities at the end of the year), the profit and loss account (which shall show the revenue and expenditure for the year), the cash flow account (which shall show how the accounting changes affect cash and cash equivalents) and the changes in net assets together with the corresponding explanations; (b) the aggregated report on the implementation of the budget covering the revenue and expenditure for the financial year in question, together with explanations on the subject.
(6) The preliminary accounts were received from us together with the statement of completeness from the accounting officer on 31 March 2015, which, in accordance with the Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, is the final deadline to be transmitted in accordance with Article 147 of the Financial Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.
The final accounts were received eight days before the date of transmission referred to in Article 148 on 31 July.
The revised analytical document on the Commission's annual accounts for the Commission's annual accounts for the Commission's annual accounts and audits and audits was forwarded to the Court on 1 September 2015.

C 373/16 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.7.
In 2014, the Commission amended the presentation of the accounts several times.
These changes aim to take account of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and to achieve an even greater alignment with international standards.
Significant improvements have been made when providing some explanations on the annual accounts (8).
points affecting the annual accounts 1.8.
As regards the annual accounts: 1.8.a) the Commission has made progress on: (a) clarification 6 on the annual accounts (on the protection of the EU budget...) in accordance with point 1.13 of the 2013 annual report and point 2 of this year's follow-up report (Annex 1.2).
This clarification now contains more detailed information.
With regard to cohesion policy, it indicates the extent to which corrections are made before the adjustment of expenditure, during implementation and during implementation.
Furthermore, these explanations do not always describe the impact of corrective actions (such as the creation of assigned revenue, expenditure withdrawn and replaced by Member States, etc.) on the EU budget (9). (b) Explanation 2.5.2 on pre-financing (advances for Member States) indicates that the Commission has limited information on the use of funds for financial instruments under shared management (EUR 3.8 billion) and other aid programmes (EUR 3.6 billion).
Significant adjustments may be necessary for the Commission to close the programming period 2007-2013.
(8) Including a consolidated summary of short-term and long-term assets and liabilities and a simplified summary of segment reports.
(9) In its explanations 6 on the 2015 accounts, the Commission seeks to take account of the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union of June 2015 in which the decision on financial corrections of EUR 457 million has been annulled.
In its explanations 2.10, these decisions are already treated as adjustments resulting from events which took place after the date of closure (Case C-549/12 P and C-54/13 P, Joined Cases C-549/12 P and C-54/13 P, C-263/13 P, C-263/13 P, C-549/12 P, C-549/12 P, and C-54/13 P, C-263/13 P, C-263/13, C-263/13 P, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13 P, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, P, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, C-263/13, P, C-263/13, P, P, P, C-263/13, P, P, P and C-263/13, C-263/13, P, P, P, C-263/13, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, C-263/, P and P, P, P, P, and C-549/12, P, P, P and P, P, P, as regards of the ERDF of Spain).
These decisions concerned expenditure incurred under the 1994-1999 operational programmes.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION C 373/17 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT on the regularity of transactions: Our overall audit results are unchanged but indicate a significant error rate 1.9.
We analyse EU revenue and expenditure to assess whether they comply with the applicable rules and other rules.
We present the results of the revenue control in Chapter 4 and the expenditure in Chapters 5 to 9 (see Table 1.1).
1.10.
Revenue was not significantly affected by errors (see paragraph 4.26).
With regard to expenditure, we still see a significant level of error.
The estimated error rate of 4.4% of expenditure (after taking into account appropriate corrective actions, see point 1.32 (10)) was similar to the 2013 indicator (4,5% (11)) (see Table 1.1).
Expenditure under the MFF 5 (MFF) (Implementation) was not significantly affected by errors (see point 9.15).
For all other operational expenditure items, expenditure was heavily affected by errors (see paragraphs 5.32-533, 6.76-6.77, 7.72-7.73 and 8.26-8.27).

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.11.
Overall, in the last three years the results have remained relatively unchanged, at a level much higher than our indicative materiality level (see Figure 1.2).
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.11.
The Commission notes that the error rate notified by the Court constitutes an annual estimate taking into account the accounting corrections of project expenditure that were made before the Court's audit was announced.
The Commission recalls that it is bound by a Financial Regulation in which Article 32 (2) (e) provides that its internal control system should, inter alia, ensure adequate management of the risks associated with the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multiannual nature of the programmes and the nature of the payments concerned.
In its 2014 summary report (COM (2015) 279 final), the Commission assessed the future impact of the correction mechanisms on EUR 2.7 billion, representing 1.9% of payments from the EU budget.
The Commission will continue to exercise its supervisory role by making financial corrections and recovery at the level corresponding to the level of irregularities and irregularities found throughout the period and at the end of the programmes.

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.12.
EU expenditure consists mainly of two types of expenditure programmes which have different types of risk (12): programmes based on payment entitlements which depend on the fulfilment of certain conditions; these programmes include scholarships for students and research scholarships (Chapter 5), direct payments for farmers (Chapter 7), direct budget support (Chapter 8) and remuneration and pensions (Chapter 9); programmes for the reimbursement of eligible costs by the EU which include research projects (Chapter 5), investment programmes for regional development and rural areas (Chapter 6 and 7), training programmes (Chapter 6) and development projects (Chapter 8).
(12) Points 1.20 to 1.22 describe in detail these different risks.
(13) Budgetary support payments contribute to the general budget of the State or to the budget allocated by the State for specific policies or objectives (see also paragraphs 8.7 and 8.8).
DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT New approach to scrutiny...
In 2014, we reworded our approach to quantifying serious infringements of public procurement rules.
This approach explains how we assess the effects of these infringements.
In particular, we have introduced a proportionate approach to the calculation of the errors associated with the change of contracts.
1.14.
To ensure comparability of the results presented in this report, we adjusted the figures for 2012 and 2013 in Table 1.1 and in figures 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6, in line with this new approach.
Annex 1.4 presents unchanged historical data on the estimated error rate calculated for the period 2009-2013.
As a result of this adjustment, the estimated total error rate in 2013 was reduced by 0,2% and by 0,3% in 2012.
The adjustment does not affect the conclusions we have reached for these years, and this is still a significant level of error.
1.15.
In 2015, we will adapt our approach to cross compliance to the revised legal framework of the common agricultural policy.
We will continue to report on the information provided by the Commission on cross compliance, but this element will no longer be the subject of our controls.
This year we have discovered many errors in cross-compliance in respect of every fourth of the farms covered by the visit.
The share of these errors in the estimated total error rate shall be 0,2 percentage points (2013: 0,2) ((14))) and 0,6 percentage points (2013: 0,5) in the error rate in the chapter on natural resources in this chapter.
The Commission welcomes the revision of the Court's approach since 2015.
As regards 2014, the Commission confirms that the breach of cross-compliance does not affect the eligibility conditions for payments (see the Commission's reply to paragraph 7.7).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/21 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT... and the new structure of our annual report 1.16.
As described in the general introduction (see paragraphs 0.5-0.7) we have changed the structure of the chapters of our annual report.
For the purposes of comparability below (Figure 1.3), the results of the last year's audit would be presented if both the new chapter structure and the new approach to quantification of infringements of public procurement rules were to be applied (see paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14).

1.17.
As shown in Figure 1.4, the cohesion area contributes most to our estimated error rate in 2014 and then to the areas of natural resources.
This distribution is in line with our 2013 findings.
EN C 373/22 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 Graph 1.4 • Contribution to the estimated overall error rate in 2014 broken down by sources of the multiannual financial framework: European Court of Auditors.
COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.18.
Errors in eligibility in reimbursement schemes have a major contribution to the errors detected in 2014 (see also paragraphs 1.20 to 1.22, graph 1.5 and graph 1.6). (a) For reimbursements, the estimated error rate is 5.5 % (2013): 5.6 %).
Typical errors in this area include: inclusion of ineligible costs in the cost statement, including ineligible projects, actions or beneficiaries, including serious breaches of procurement rules in the course of the award of contracts, including serious breaches of procurement rules in the course of the performance of the contract (i.e. changes in contracts and additional contracts).
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 1.18. (a) The Commission has also identified similar problems in its audits.
During the 2007-2013 programming period, the Commission has made considerable efforts to identify the true cause of the problems and, where appropriate, to take corrective action.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/23 DE COURT'S COMMENTS b) For payment entitlements programmes, the estimated error rate is 2,7% (2013: 3,0%).
Typical errors in this area include: in this case overestimating the number of land by farmers, including administrative errors in payments made by farmers.
Figure 1.5 • Participation in the estimated total error rate broken down by type of error Source: European Court of Auditors.
1.19.
The figures for 2013 presented in Figure 1.5 are drawn up on the same basis as the figures for 2014, i.e. on the basis of the approach described in point 1.13.
C 373/24 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE THE COURT'S COMMENTS ON THE TYPE OF EXPENDITURE AND THE ErrorS ARE Strictly bound 1.20.
We have analysed the relationship between the type of expenditure and the risk of error.
In the case of EU expenditure, the extent to which the correct calculation of payments to beneficiaries depends on the information provided by the beneficiaries themselves.
This applies to the largest category of expenditure schemes based on payment entitlements: area aid paid to farmers.
This is particularly important for refund schemes: the beneficiaries must provide information in the application in order to demonstrate that they are involved in an action eligible for the refund and have incurred eligible costs.
This applies to all types of management (15).
1.21.
Figure 1.6 is based on all checks carried out on EU expenditure over the last two years, both on annual reports on the general budget and on the European Development Fund (16).
Cash flow is grouped according to their type.
The size of the circles on this chart means the share of the total expenditure, the positioning of which along the line of 45 degrees indicates the estimated error rate, the colour of which indicates whether this is the entitlement or the expenditure based on the return.
1.22.
This chart shows both the elements of discretionary recognition (assessment of the impact of systems and risks associated with the type of operation and the empirical elements (assessment of the estimated error rates over the two-year period).
Firstly, it aims to meet the wishes of our addressees for more information on the different risk profiles, and secondly to help the Commission to take action in areas where the error rate remains high.
1.20.
The Integrated Management and Control System (IACS) including the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) contributes significantly to the prevention and reduction of errors (see paragraph 7.32).
The PSC shall be established and operated by the national authorities.
Payments to final beneficiaries are only possible after comparison of their claims with the data available in the land identification system.
The LPI means that the error rate for area aid is lower than for all other types of aid under shared management.
The Commission considers that the boxes 1.2 and 1.3 confirm this position.

C 373/26 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT The results in the various expenditure areas show different error patterns in terms of competitiveness. in Chapter 5: The estimated error rate is 5,6% and is therefore higher than the corresponding error rate in 2013 (4,0%[17].Most expenditure is based on reimbursement of costs and errors in this area reflect in principle the different categories of ineligible costs (mainly staff costs, other direct costs and indirect costs).
1.24.. Coherence................ (Chapter 6): the estimated error rate is 5,7% and is therefore higher than the corresponding error rate in 2013 (5,3% (17)).
Almost all expenditure in this area is in the form of reimbursement.
The main reasons for errors are serious infringements of public procurement rules (approximately half of the estimated error rate) and then ineligible costs in the declarations of expenditure (more than one quarter of the estimated error rate).
The infringement of State aid rules and of ineligible projects is the remainder of the error.
1.25.. Natural resources.... (Chapter 7): The estimated error rate is 3.6% and is therefore lower than the corresponding error rate for 2013 (4,4% (17).
The European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EGF) accounts for more than three quarters of the expenditure in this area and this Fund is less sensitive to errors than the part of rural development for which we have long seen a high level of error, in particular in respect of expenditure incurred on the basis of reimbursement of costs.
Overall, over-the-number of areas or animals by farmers has contributed to around one third of the estimated error rate.
Errors related to ineligible beneficiaries, actions or expenditure were the second highest percentage (around a quarter of the estimated error rate).
The main remaining shares constitute a breach of cross-compliance (one sixth) and an administrative error (one sixth).
1.23.
See Commission replies to Chapter 5 of the annual report (point 5.6.5.17).
1.24.
See Commission replies to Chapter 6 of the annual report (paragraphs 623 to 6.45 and 6.76).
1.25.
The lower error rate in the EAGF reflects the effectiveness of the HACCP system, and in particular the LRIS system, with regard to the correct implementation, with regard to the prevention of errors from the first moment of the process.
The Commission considers that the HACCP system as a whole is a sound system for managing CAP expenditure.
See also paragraphs 1.15 and 1.20, paragraphs 7.15 to 7.19 and paragraphs 7.25 to 7.29.
(17) This comparative number takes account of both the reallocation of budgetary items in order to ensure that the chapters reflect the MFF principles and the new approach to infringements of public procurement rules.
See also Figure 1.3.
DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.26. Europe in the world... (Chapter 8): The estimated error rate is 2,7% and is therefore higher than the corresponding error rate for 2013 (2.1% ((18))) ((19).
The ineligible costs reimbursed by the Commission represent more than half of the overall error rate.
Payments for unexecuted works and services or for unexecuted supplies constitute a quarter of the total error rate.
The rest is due to a lack of evidence (about one tenth of the estimated error rate), incorrect calculation of expenditure and infringements of public procurement rules.
1.27.... (Chapter 9): the estimated error rate is 0,5 %, representing a decrease compared to the corresponding 2013 results (brutto (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto)) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto)) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brutto) (brut) (brutto) (brut) (brut) (brutto) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut) (brut)
Most expenditure in this area concerns salaries, pensions and allowances paid by EU institutions and bodies.
A small number of errors in the area of additives represented the largest percentage of errors in this area, which is not relevant at all.
1.28.
As explained in the introduction, we do not create a separate chapter for expenditure which does not fall within the scope of the MFF 1, 2, 4 and 5.
Therefore, the remaining expenditure of a total of EUR 2.1 billion (1.5% of the expenditure covered by our control) is presented in this Chapter (20).
A total of EUR 2.1 billion of EUR 0.5 billion shows that expenditure incurred by and by the 10 agencies that are the subject of our special annual reports[21].
The main errors identified in this area consisted in the reimbursement of ineligible costs (see Box 1.1).
(18) This comparative number takes account of both the re-sharing of budget lines in order to ensure that chapters reflect the conditions of the MFF and the new approach to infringements of public procurement rules.

The Commission's replies to the Court's comments Box 1.1 The Commission's replies to the Commission's comments The Commission's opinion is that the Commission's opinion is that the opinion is based on the opinion of the European Parliament and the Council and the Committee of the Regions of the Regions and the opinion of the European Parliament and of the Council that the Committee of the Regions is of the opinion of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Parliament and of the Council and of the Council and the Committee of the Regions and of the Committee of the Regions of the European Union and of the Council of the European Union and of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The beneficiary of the State aid divided two permanent employees (officials) into half-days into projects and covered part of the remuneration in the project cost report.
Members' staff shall bear additional costs only if additional staff are required to replace officials in their usual activities and therefore bear actual costs.
These costs are not eligible because the beneficiary has not taken any action to replace the officials.
The total amount of ineligible costs declared by the recipient of the aid was EUR 58 000 of total costs of EUR 237 000.
For eight of the 25 MFF 3 projects, we identified ineligible costs which were reimbursed by the Commission.

Therefore, since 2011, the Commission has amended the eligibility rules applicable to staff of public bodies, using the flexibility provided for in the rules implementing the Financial Regulation.
Consequently, the ineligible costs (staff costs in public bodies which are not eligible for substitution) laid down by the Court in the aid in question are now considered eligible for aid.
1.29.
The total estimated error rate for shared management expenditure is 4,6% (in 2013: 4,9% (in %)) and 4,6% (in 2013: 3,7% (in %) for all other operational expenditure (%) (%) (in 2013) (in 2013) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in 2013) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %)) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %)))))) (in 2013.
The estimated error rate in administrative expenditure is 0.5 % (2013: 1,0% (22)).
(22) This comparative number takes into account the new approach to infringements of public procurement rules.
See also paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14.
(23) These expenditure is mainly covered by Chapters 7 and 8, but is partly covered by the expenditure referred to in Chapters 5 and 6.
The high level of error in shared management expenditure is based on an analysis of 687 transactions (the population of EUR 113 billion).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/29 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT There are many forms of corrective action with different impacts of 1.30.
Our examination of errors and corrections of the ed is aimed at examining complex mechanisms for the implementation and recording of corrective actions and explaining the various ways in which these mechanisms can affect our examination work.
In some areas of expenditure, the Commission will have new instruments if expenditure is incurred in the new programming period.
Corrective measures 1.31.
We are trying to take account of the corrective actions taken by the Member States and the Commission prior to the payment or our investigation.
We also note the corrections that occur after our audit announcement, but we cannot reduce the estimated error rate each time the control itself triggers the corrective action (24).
We verify the application of these corrections (including the recovery of funds from beneficiaries and corrections at project level) and, where appropriate, adjust the calculation of the error rate.
However, the effects of corrective actions vary considerably depending on the area of expenditure and corrective actions.
1.32.
The Commission and the authorities of the Member States have taken corrective measures in respect of 24 sampled transactions in 2014, which had a direct impact on the operation in question and were relevant for our calculations.
These corrective actions have led to a reduction of our estimated error rate by 1.1 percentage points (in 2013 1.6 percentage points), corresponding to around EUR 1.6 billion.
Changes in the number of transactions and the impact on the estimated error rate do not indicate that the corrective actions are more or less effective: in view of the relatively small part of our sample, it can be expected that they will change from year to year.
1.30.
The Commission considers that the annual representative error rate of the Court should be considered in relation to the Commission's ability to correct the various annual activity reports and in the summary report.
The Financial Regulation requires appropriate consideration of the risks associated with the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multi-annual nature of the control systems and the nature of the payments.
1.31.
In its 2014 summary report (COM (2015) 279 final), the Commission assessed the future impact of the correction mechanisms on EUR 2.7 billion, representing 1.9% of payments from the EU budget.
Table 1 presents the breakdown by policy area in the summary report.
The Commission stresses that any financial corrections and recovery of undue expenditure exclude recovery from the EU budget (see explanatory note 6 to the accounts).
(24) See paragraphs 1.19 to 1.37 of the annual report for the financial year 2012.
The Commission uses the terms "financial corrections" and "financial corrections" to take account of the broad range of corrective actions that apply both before and after the Commission (or reimbursement) of expenditure.
1.34.
The 6.2.2 explanations on the annual accounts set out the total amount of EUR 3285 million for corrective actions in 2014.
Graph 1.7 shows how we classify adjustments made at different stages of the expenditure cycle.
A quarter of all corrective actions in 2014 consist of corrections and recovery made in the spring village, i.e. before the Commission made the related payment (25).
The next fourth takes the form of the withdrawal and replacement of cohesion project expenditure (in the course of or at the time of the closure of operational programmes). 1.33.
The Commission considers that the terms "financial corrections" and "corrections" are applied in accordance with the legal framework set out in the Financial Regulation and the relevant sectoral legislation.
Further details on the different preventive and corrective mechanisms provided for in the applicable legislation are provided in note 6 to the EU accounts and in the Communication on the protection of the EU budget.
(25) For the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, in 2014, the notified corrections of EUR 430 million compared to the source in 2014, of which 75% had already taken place in previous years.

COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.35.
The corrective actions discussed in this Section of the annual report shall include the work of the Member States' authorities as well as the recovery operations carried out by the national authorities and the Commission.
C 373/32 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 10.11.2015 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT The consequences of the corrective action are largely evident when the Commission accepts the expenditure 1.36.
All relevant sectoral regulations on shared management contain provisions on pre-control or reduction of amounts declared by final beneficiaries prior to the declaration of expenditure by national authorities.
In some cases, national authorities also agree to reduce or remove some of the costs that, due to errors of long-term impact, appear in the declarations (such as continuous payments under the contract, where there is an error in the rules for the award of public contracts).
Such adjustments may have a measurable impact on the level of refunds on individual projects or on the level of aid paid to individual farmers and the correction contributes to the reduction of our estimated error rate.
1.37.
For direct and indirect management, the amounts which are recorded by the Commission shall include, inter alia, the deduction of amounts which are not eligible for payment applications prior to the approval of payments.
Eligibility of amounts shall be determined on the basis of the examination of the documentation available or on the basis of the results of the checks carried out (see also Figure 1.7).
This also allows us to lower our estimated error rate.
Conformity decisions (on financial corrections in the agricultural sector) are often taken in a flat-rate manner.
In general, they refer to system flaws rather than to errors at the level of the final beneficiaries.
In rare cases, they entail recovery of quotas from the farmers concerned.
Such corrective measures encourage Member States to improve their management and control systems.
They contribute to the legality and regularity of transactions at the level of the final beneficiaries if they lead to permanent improvements in the accounts of expenditure accepted by the paying agencies (see Boxes 1.2 and 1.3).
In addition, the Commission services shall recover funds from the Fund on the basis of the deduction of ineligible expenditure (as defined in previous or current accounts of expenditure) from payments made.
1.38.
Financial corrections by the Commission in respect of agricultural expenditure are intended to protect the EU budget and require Member States to apply them.
They do not directly lead to recovery of payments from farmers, as the Commission does not pay directly to the final beneficiaries, but returns payments made by Member States to farmers.
However, if payments are not identifiable as a result of the conformity clearance procedure, the Commission would expect Member States to continue to verify them by means of recovery actions against beneficiaries.
See response to Box 1.3.
The paying agencies shall implement conformity decisions by reducing future requests by the Commission for reimbursement of payment costs to farmers.
The Commission shall record the full amount paid to farmers as expenditure, which means that the adjustment does not entail a reduction in the amount of payments covered by the payments.
Instead, the difference between payments to farmers and refunds to paying agencies is recorded as assigned revenue available to finance agricultural expenditure (26).
Over two thirds of financial corrections in 2014 in the area of cohesion in...
1.40.
In the area of consistency, financial corrections for more than two thirds of the total amount included in the report shall be those where the public authorities in the Member States withdraw the expenditure concerned and replace it with new expenditure.
For some cases of withdrawal, no specific projects can be considered to be withdrawn.
Instead, Member States report additional projects and therefore receive de facto lower co-financing rates.
1.40. The Commission considers that any financial corrections, including corrections, for which Member States have the right to submit new projects and new expenditure to re-use the corrected amounts, protect the EU budget against illegal expenditure and encourage Member States to recover amounts from beneficiaries (and thus contribute to improving management and control systems).
However, the deterrent effect of net financial corrections, where Member States are unable to re-use the corrected and recovered amounts and are therefore losing resources, is certainly higher.
(26) For example, if the paying agency in the agricultural sector, which makes a financial correction of 5%, makes a payment to farmers of EUR 100 million, the Commission will reimburse the payment of EUR 95 million, while the Commission will pay EUR 100 million, which will be covered on the basis of assigned revenue of EUR 5 million.
C 373/34 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT... whereas net corrections are made less frequently 1.41.
Where it is not possible to replace, adjustments to the Member State concerned lead to the loss of EU funds[27]................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"""""""""" "" "" "" "" """ "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" """""""""" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Commission expects net corrections to be applied to a wider extent in the future as a result of changes in legislation. 1.41.
For example, in the agricultural field, the legislator decided to apply a similar net financial correction mechanism to cohesion policy in the 2014-2020 programming period.
This provides an additional incentive for Member States to prevent or detect serious irregularities in their management and control systems and to remove them before their financial statements are transmitted to the Commission.
Otherwise, and if the Commission or the Court continue to detect serious deficiencies after the submission of the accounts, the Commission must make a net financial correction under the conditions laid down in the relevant regulations, which means that the Member State concerned has lost its financial resources.
The Commission also considers that, under shared management, any financial corrections and recovery have a negative impact on national budgets, regardless of how they are implemented.
In order to avoid the loss of EU funding, the Member State must replace expenditure not eligible for additional operations eligible for aid.
This means that a Member State and its national budget bear the financial consequences of the loss of EU co-financing, which is considered ineligible, provided that the Member State does not recover the amounts from the individual beneficiaries.
(27) Either as a reduction in payments or as a return to the EU budget, which leads to assigned revenue (see Figure 2.2).
(28) After the programmes have been completed.
(29) In the absence of an agreement between the Member States and the Commission (see point 1.25 (b) of the annual report for the financial year 2012).
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union REPLY OF THE COMMISSION C 373/35 DE THE COURT'S COMMENTS In 2014, the Commission and the Member States applied all these forms of corrective action 1.42.
Box 1.2-1.4 presents different types of corrective action and their effects. Box 1.2.2 For more information on the improvement of management and control systems in Greece: Improving the land identification system The Commission has taken action to improve the identification system for agricultural parcels (LPIS), which serves as the basis for payments to agricultural holdings, for example under the single payment scheme (the largest EU spending system).
This process took place at various stages and led to a reduction of permanent grassland from 3.6 million hectares in 2012 to 1.5 million hectares in October 2014, included in the GreekLPIS.

We have taken into account the impact of the adjustments for individual payments to final beneficiaries that have been the subject of our sample of EAGF and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Another effect is that the paying agency rejected many ineligible applications, which resulted in the corresponding expenditure falling out of our sample.

Action plans shall be implemented whenever deemed necessary and the Commission shall carefully monitor their implementation and report on the corrective actions taken in the annual activity report of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development.
The land identification system prevents beneficiaries from seeking claims in respect of land which does not exist or which does not fulfil eligibility conditions or in respect of land in respect of which another beneficiary has already made claims.
With proper implementation, this is a very effective tool to reduce error rates.
It covers 75% of CAP expenditure.
According to the Annual Activity Report of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development for 2014, the error rate for area payments is lower than for other measures.

The national authorities have stated that this will have no impact on farmers and that this will be financed by the national budget.
In previous annual reports, we stressed that this approach does not encourage beneficiaries to correct errors (32).
The main reasons for the correction were the weaknesses in the LRIS/GIS system (EUR 695 million) and the ceiling for payment entitlements, which led to an excessive payment for farmers (EUR 41 million).
Another reason, although to a lesser extent, was the breach of the cross-compliance obligation with regard to the timely notification of movements of animals (EUR 123 million).
All these reasons relate to payments made between 2009 and 2013.
No adjustment was made in 2014 and the non-compliance with the ceiling for payment entitlements and non-qualifying land covered by the PDO in France contributed to an increase in our estimated error rate for natural resources of 0,3 percentage points this year.

A financial correction of EUR 1.1 billion will be reimbursed to the EU budget in three annual instalments (2015-2017 and 2017).
The Commission notes that, given the nature of the ex post conformity clearance procedure, which applies very rarely, after the clearance of the accounts procedure in the year and after the end of the adversarial period, in which the Member State concerned may present its own arguments and calculations, the Commission shall decide on the financial correction in the following year of expenditure.
The ongoing conformity clearance procedure will ensure that the EU budget is protected for 2014.

In 2013, we managed to reduce the estimated error rate for a number of Romanian projects of the European Social Fund (ESF) because the national authorities identified the impact of the corrections at the project level.
This was also the case in 2014.
Some of the projects we have examined are still flawed due to problems that are not covered by the corrections.
In its 2014 Annual Activity Report, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Integration (DG EMPL) indicated that it continued to monitor the implementation of the agreed action plan.
Revised financial corrections do not necessarily mean that Romania will receive less EU funds because Member States can benefit from the possibility of recovering more expenditure (33).
(30) A procedure for several years which allows for the recovery of amounts paid to Member States where these payments are incompatible with EU rules or where there are shortcomings in the management and control systems in the Member State.
See also paragraph 7.59.
(31) France subsequently appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union against the decision to impose a financial correction.
(32) See paragraphs 1.26 and 1.32 of the annual report for the financial year 2012.
(33) In practice, this would mean a reduction in the rate of EU co-financing.
10.11.2015 Official Journal of the European Union C 373/37 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT In its report on corrective actions, the Commission does not always quantify their different effects,...
1.43.
Explanation 6 on annual accounts is largely voluntary disclosure which is not required in accordance with accounting principles.
A significant part of this information does not come from accounting systems.
The explanation describes the different impacts of the different adjustments to the EU budget, but not always in quantitative form... and further improvements would allow for a better analysis of 1.44.
The Commission's ability to improve the quality of expenditure is linked not only to the amounts concerned but also to their impact.
A rigorous assessment of the impact of corrective actions requires better identification of the type of corrected error and the way in which corrections are made (34).
Where the relevant Commission Directorates-General assess the impact of their corrective actions, they shall make the necessary adjustments to the figures set out in note 6 (see point 1.55).
The Commission's summary report confirms significant errors in transactions 1.45.
Each Directorate-General of the Commission shall draw up an annual activity report.
This report shall report on the implementation of the main policy objectives (as approved in Chapter 3), the management report prepared by the Director-General for the College of Commissioners and the statement in which the Director-General (Directives) accepts the assurance that the financial information contained in the report is adequately presented and that the transactions that fall under its responsibility are legal and regular.
1.43.
The legislator has provided the Commission with the financial correction instrument to ensure that the expenditure effected unlawfully is not financed by the EU budget.
Financial corrections mainly relate to system flaws that lead to a risk of error.
The task of the Member States, not the Commission, is to establish irregular amounts and recover them from the beneficiaries.
If this is not the case, EU funds will be replaced by national funds, as national budgets have to bear the cost of financial corrections.
1.44.
Several services have adjusted their figures in their explanations 6 in relation to the protection of the EU budget in order to allow for the estimation of future corrections in relation to their specific circumstances.
(34) See paragraphs 1.13 to 1.15 of the annual report for the financial year 2013.
C 373/38 Official Journal of the European Union 10.11.2015 DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.46. The summary report contains a summary of this information and a statement that, when adopting the summary report, the Commission assumes overall political responsibility for the management of the EU budget.
1.47.
This section of the chapter contains the results of our analysis of the annual reports on the activities of the Directorates-General and the Commission summary report[35].
It focuses on the coherence and adequacy of the Commission's estimates of the error rate at the time of reimbursement or reimbursement by the Commission of its own expenditure (the Commission refers to the amount of risk to the greater extent that the errors will be corrected by subsequent corrections (the Commission refers to its ability to correct or to estimated future corrections at most (36)).
The Directors-General shall report annually on the regularity of 1.48.
If the Directors-General are unable to guarantee credibility in respect of a significant part of the expenditure, they raise reservations (see Box 1.5).
Directors-general should do so when, having a serious impact on the reputation of the Commission, or, still have a significant impact on the impact of the estimated error rates reduced by the financial corrections already made and the recovery of funds.

The increase in the total number of reservations is due to three new reservations of the Directors-General of the Communication, Content and Technology Network (37) and of the Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations Policy (DG NEAR) (37) (37) and the Foreign Policy Instruments Service (FPI) (40) (40) (40) (40) (40) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (43) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42) (42)) () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () ( () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () () ( () () () () () () () () () ( () () () ( () () () () ( () () ( ( () () ( () ())))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ()))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ()))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( () ( ()))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ()))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ())))))))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ())))))))))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ()) ( ( ( ( ( ())))))))))))))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ()))) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (
In 2014, the amount of conditional expenditure decreased from EUR 2,4 billion in 2013 to EUR 2,3 billion in 2014 (43).
1.49.
The European Parliament resolution on discharge for 2013[44] calls on the Commission to further clarify the calculation of the amount of risk by clarifying the estimated impact of corrective mechanisms on this number.
(37) Reservation for the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT) in the countries participating in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) since the residual error rate exceeds 2% (2.94%).
(38) Reservation for indirect management by beneficiary countries as the residual error rate exceeds 2% (2,67%).
(39) The problems identified in the 2013 Annual Report led to a new reservation in the light of the reputation of DG NEAR (previous DG Enlargement), see paragraph 7.16 of the 2013 Annual Report.
(40) Reservation for expenditure under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since the residual error rate exceeds 2% (2.13%).

DE COMMENTS FROM THE COURT 1.50.
In line with the proposal of the discharge authority in 2014, the Commission developed internal guidelines (45) for the submission of information in the annual activity reports.
Directors-general are now to present the average error rate detected (46).
The application of this error rate to the total payments for a given year leads to the calculation of the risk amount of that year[47].
The summary report sets out this amount together with estimates of the future ex post audit capacity carried out by the Commission. The Commission acknowledges that expenditure is heavily affected by errors.
1.51.
In its 2014 summary report, the Commission identified a risk amount of between EUR 3.7 and EUR 5 billion.
This corresponds to between 2,6% and 3.5% of the payments included in the 2014 summary report[48].
These figures show that total expenditure is largely affected by errors... but indicate the estimated impact of future corrections of 1.52.
The 2014 Summary Report provides for the total estimated value of future corrections (correction potential).
On the basis of the corrections registered over the last six years[49], the Commission estimates that in the coming years it will be able to detect and correct errors in the total amount of around EUR 2700 million over the next six years.
(45) Standing Instructions for the 2014 Annual Activity Reports (SEC (2014) 553).
(46) This is the level of error detected or estimated at the time of payment (not the residual error rate), i.e. without the correction resulting from errors corrected in advance.
